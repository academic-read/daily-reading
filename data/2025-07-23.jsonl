Compared to traditional advertising, social advertisements leverage the ``word-of-mouth effect&apos;&apos;, swiftly spreading and exerting significant influence on social networks. Existing social advertising recommendation algorithms typically focus on individual user ad acceptance, neglecting the interconnections among ads. In reality, a user&apos;s response to an ad is often influenced by prior ad exposures, and associations of the content between products. In this paper, based on triggering model, we introduce the multi-round Social Advertising Sequence Influence Maximization (SASIM) problem from the perspective of recommendation platforms. The SASIM problem integrates influence spread within user networks and the promotional impact of ad connections. Depending on the user feedback from the previous round, we design two algorithms: the non-adaptive greedy algorithm and the adaptive greedy algorithm, which incorporate edge-based greedy strategies. These algorithms aim to select suitable ads and arrange them in an optimal sequence for specific users, for maximizing the revenue of the ad acceptance and influence spread. The experiments are conducted on various real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for the multi-round SASIM problem."}}

We evaluate models by binary cross-entropies for a holdout sample. Among benchmark models the long-short term neural net attains the best cross-entropy value. However, this recurrent net is outperformed by the transformer with six embedding dimensions, two attention heads and four transformer blocks. Adding own effects of category-specific advertising to the transformer leads to a further improvement. We follow different approaches to interpret this transformer. We determine dynamic dependences between pairs of product categories based on proportional sampling using both original and increased estimated purchase probabilities. For our data the number of complementary dependences is much higher than the number of substitutive dependences. We show that these dependences differ from similarities computed from the static embeddings also estimated by the transformer. We illustrate the dynamics reproduced by the transformer by weekly purchase probabilities for selected product categories and household types. We derive marginal effects of category-specific advertising. These effects are at least moderate in ten of 31 product categories. As a rule, marginal effects in these ten categories differ between selected weeks."}}

This study bridges the critical gap by examining how organisations systematically integrate traditional and agile frameworks in practice. Leveraging a constructivist grounded theory approach, we analyse a multinational IT consultancy’s hybrid software project through in-depth interviews, participant observations, and archival data. Our findings reveal contingent hybridity, a dynamic, context-driven process in which hybridity emerges not as a predetermined model but as an ongoing negotiation between governance and agility. Four key dimensions underpin this phenomenon: (1) structural anchoring, where PRINCE2 establishes governance scaffolding; (2) adaptive enactment, where Scrum and agile methods flexibly operate within structured constraints; (3) boundary work, involving translator roles and hybrid ceremonies to reconcile methodological divides; and (4) role hybridisation, where practitioners fluidly alternate between control-oriented and delivery-focused responsibilities. Challenging prescriptive hybrid frameworks, this study demonstrates that successful integration hinges on situational adaptation rather than standardised templates. Theoretically, we propose a process-oriented model of hybridisation, moving beyond static typologies to capture its emergent and contested nature. Practically, we offer actionable insights for organisations navigating the agility-control paradox. Ultimately, this research redefines hybrid project management as a negotiated practice, continuously shaped by context, power dynamics, and practitioner sensemaking, rather than a codified methodology."}}

We demonstrate that marginal revenue in the live-stream channel can exceed that of the traditional channel, revealing structured price discrimination across consumer motivation types. The streamer exhibits nuanced effort strategies: prioritizing promotion effort at extreme consumer motivation ratios but shifting to development effort at a moderate ratio. Regarding channel strategies, we identify that promotion effort generates greater manufacturer benefits within a given channel, while the dual-channel structure proves superior under equivalent effort modes. Under equilibrium, each channel strategy can become optimal for the manufacturer under specific conditions, while the streamer&apos;s profit may be compromised under the manufacturer&apos;s preferred channel S or OS configurations. Although channel S introduces profit erosion through streamer participation, the manufacturer can strategically leverage it to incentivize promotion effort for profit maximization. However, the extended model reveals that channel S ceases to be manufacturer-optimal when the streamer endogenously balances promotion and development efforts, as the manufacturer loses the ability to unilaterally influence effort allocation."}}

In Bangladesh there exist some regulations such as the Consumer Rights Protection Act (2009) and Digital Commerce Operation Guidelines (2021), however the implementation of these regulations are weak and overall literacy rates are very low. The existence of scams, product misrepresentation and problems with delays particularly in rural/semi-urban areas such as Feni are reflective of pockets of systemic loopholes in the ecommerce system as it stands. This study is based on consumer attitude towards online shopping and evaluates the adequacy of e-commerce policies based on qualitative examination of legal instruments and survey results from 30 participants. The results indicate that 56.67% prefer online shopping because it is more convenient to shop, but the main anxiety is fraud (63.3%) along with lack of knowledge of consumer legal protection (33.33%).

Understanding users' decision-making processes and preferences is crucial for the development of effective SBRs. Drawing insights from consumer behavior and psychology literature, we examine two key psychological states---fixed and exploratory states---that shape users’ behavior in evaluating product attributes. Specifically, the fixed state reflects an internal tendency to maintain consistency with past choices, while the exploratory state captures users’ inclination to seek various and novel options. Methodologically, we propose a novel Attribute-aware Session-based Recommendation method that innovatively distinguishes between the Fixed and Exploratory states, called ASR-FE. Our method features three novel components: (1) a time-weighted sequence variance mechanism that identifies users’ fixed and exploratory states for each attribute sequence, and two heterogeneous decoders---(2) a fixed state decoder and (3) an exploratory state decoder---to predict users’ attribute preferences based on the corresponding psychological states. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating the fixed and exploratory states not only enhances recommendation accuracy but also improves the interpretability of our model, yielding crucial implications for e-commerce platforms."}}

This necessitates divergent compensation strategiesincreasing performance sensitivity for managers while decreasing it for workers. The multi-dimensional nature of AI capabilities requires sophisticated contracts rewarding not just output but also learning contributions and knowledge creation. Dynamic learning eects create persistent and potentially accelerating compensation gaps, driven by dierential learning rates and capability-performance complementarities."}}

Further, with minimal data available for training, the challenge is to identify whether an answer generated by a large language model is correct and do it on the fly. This study is the first to define the correctness of a response based on how the support team at AFAS makes decisions. It leverages literature on natural language generation and automated answer grading systems to automate the decision-making of the customer support team. We investigated questions requiring a binary response (e.g., Would it be possible to adjust tax rates manually?) or instructions (e.g., How would I adjust tax rate manually?) to test how close our automated approach reaches support rating.

Its primary goal is to address the research gap regarding comprehensive analyses of how AI integration generates new business models, modifies existing ones, and impacts companies and players.Design/methodology/approachThe study combines a systematic literature review (SLR) of 56 Scopus publications on business models and AI applications, with qualitative empirical research using comparative case studies of Ubisoft (proactive generative AI adoption) and CD Projekt (cautious approach). Analysis criteria included strategic goals, creative control, and legal/ethical challenges.FindingsThe study demonstrates that AI creates opportunities for innovation, ranging from enhancing the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs) to generating content and personalizing gameplay. Ubisoft utilizes generative AI (Ghostwriter, NEO NPC) for NPC dialogue automation and dynamic interactions while preserving creator control, optimizing production, and enhancing immersion. CD Projekt avoids generative AI in core projects (e.g., The Witcher 4) due to legal/content quality risks, limiting AI to supportive roles (testing, voice replication of deceased actors). AI transforms business models through: production cost reduction, player experience personalization (20-30% retention increase), and novel monetization paths (NFT economies).OriginalityThis study aims to integrate SLR with an empirical comparison of polarized AI strategies in gaming. It reveals that the impact of AI&apos;s business model depends on the technological approach and risk tolerance, identifying concrete AI tools (e.g., dynamic pricing) that can revolutionize freemium models. By dissecting real-world cases (e.g., Ubisoft&apos;s \"guardrails\" for ethical AI and CD Projekt&apos;s copyright concerns), it highlights actionable pathways and barriers for studios navigating AI adoption, balancing innovation with creative control, ethics, and legal risks. This dual theoretical-empirical lens, combined with its focus on business model evolution rather than pure technology, positions the article as a pioneering framework for future research and industry strategy."}}

The traditional penetration testing frameworks are seen to be employing old detection methods and are almost monolithic in their construction, resulting in no provision for the verification of an exploit at run time. All these have rendered these systems less useful in today&apos;s cybersecurity workflow, as well as in the teaching curriculum. A next-generation, modular, and web application vulnerability detecting and exploitation framework was introduced to address the above-described limitations. Being a fully pluggable architecture, WebRecon is eminently customizable to any purpose—the payload, the scanning engine, and the exploitation script. On detection of any vulnerability, under real-time circumstances, the payload is launched immediately, testing with a high degree of precision and efficiency, based on context. The system detects and penetrates critical vulnerabilities arising from XSS, SQL Injection, Command Execution, and Directory Traversal. Being fast, it works wonderfully embedded within a CI/CD pipeline for testing, or also just for fast assessments, courtesy parallelized scanning and lightweight threading. To curb potential misuse of the system by someone with criminal ends, the framework has been containerized by Docker. This gives the ability to constrain and govern the execution environment and protects a possibility for either misconfiguration or irresponsible use, while keeping WebRecon sufficiently flexible for the ethical use case. It also features an optional CTF Automation."}}

Comprehensive experimental results indicate that the DREAM outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy, while thorough ablation studies affirm the necessity of its architectural components.

This paper combines lightweight LLMs with edge computing to propose an offline AI copilot framework for construction tutorials. It is divided into a web UI and a backend with four layers: interaction, agent, engine, and OS layer. A three-stage workflow is designed to guide lightweight LLMs in tool use and multiple optimization strategies are employed to improve system efficiency. The copilot was deployed on a smartphone and a simulation experiment was conducted to verify its performance. The results demonstrate the copilot provides accurate responses to queries about different tasks with acceptable interaction latency.

In this paper, we empirically analyze the distribution of session lengths and the variety of online consumption for both mobile devices and home computers. The analyses utilize data on home computer consumption in 2008 and 2019, as well as data on mobile consumption from 2019. We find little change in the variety of consumption on home computers between 2008 and 2019. It also shows that mobile platforms are associated with shorter, more frequent sessions and more concentrated consumption patterns compared to home devices. As users spend more time online via mobile devices, they tend to focus on a limited set of high-utility apps or websites, resulting in reduced variety compared to home computer usage. Taken together, the results suggest that the introduction of smartphones had little effect on the allocation patterns of home computer consumption, while encouraging a more concentrated pattern of use on mobile devices."}}

The hotel review data from TripAdvisor.com exhibit an inverted U-shaped effect of photo aesthetics on perceived review helpfulness, in which review text length moderates this relationship. To further validate this causal relationship and explore the underlying mediating effects, an experimental study is conducted. The experimental results confirm the causal impact of photo aesthetics on perceived review helpfulness and reveal that perceived pleasure, reviewer effort and review authenticity mediate the relationship. These novel insights challenge the notion that \"the more aesthetic, the better\" for review photos, offering new theoretical and practical implications."}}

The energy-oriented hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with limited buffers (EO-HFSP-LB) is commonly observed in real-world manufacturing environments, especially in energy-intensive sectors such as steel, cement, and aluminum manufacturing. In this paper, we investigate an EO-HFSP-LB that simultaneously minizines total weighted tardiness (TWT) and non-processing energy (NPE), two conflicting and non-regular objectives. To address this problem, we propose a learning-guided multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (LgMOEA) that can efficiently search for Pareto-optimal solutions by leveraging problem-specific knowledge. The main components of LgMOEA include: (1) a forward-backward scheduling procedure for solution decoding; (2) objective-guided genetic and neighborhood operators to effectively explore and exploit the solution space; and (3) a learning-guided operator selection module that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 25 well-synthesized benchmark instances. Computational results show that (1) the LgMOEA outperforms state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms in terms of hypervolume, spacing, and success rate; and (2) the learning module provides a more effective balance than random operator selection. The source code of LgMOEA is made available at: https://github.com/janason/Soft-Scheduling/tree/master/LgMOEA."}}

The optimal policy in this setting is theoretically straightforward but difficult for managers to implement directly. I propose a novel method called FIND that leverages historical forecasts to convert a point estimate of demand into a conditional probability distribution. In eight experiments, FIND outperforms all other ordering regimes considered over a broad range of conditions. To model subtle, unstructured demand signals, the last four experiments convey managerial insight non-quantitatively using images, colors, and tones. FIND performs equally well with these perceptual signals as it does with more traditional numerical signals."}}

Contrary to prevailing assumptions that PBCs dilute corporate power in favor of broader stakeholder governance, PBC statutes actually entrench and extend director primacy beyond its expression in traditional corporate law. Directors of PBCs are granted wide discretion to define and pursue plural corporate purposes while facing minimal accountability from shareholders or other stakeholders. The essay explores the theoretical and practical implications of this regime, including its potential to intensify, rather than restrain, the exercise of corporate power, and offers a new explanation for why profit-maximizing actors might be drawn to investment in the PBC form."}}

Though formulated as a single-objective problem, we show that it is intrinsically multi-objective in that DRO solutions map out a near-Pareto-optimal frontier between expected cost and a measure of robustness called worst-case sensitivity (WCS). We take this as the starting point and explore robust decision making through a multi-objective lens. We show that WCS is a measure of spread and derive WCS for a collection of uncertainty sets commonly used in DRO. These sensitivity measures identify the errors against which the nominal expected cost is most vulnerable and the uncertainty set for the worst-case problem that most effectively mitigates it. The associated mean-sensitivity frontier is used to select its size. The multi-objective perspective provides a quantitative measure of robustness and a sensitivity-based approach to addressing important conceptual gaps in DRO-how to choose the family and size of uncertainty sets for a given cost distribution, and how this affects the solution."}}

This application achieves improvements in optimizing payment batches of size 70 and 140, showing daily average liquidity savings of respectively EUR 23 million and EUR 38 million over a 35 days sample. We benchmark the CQM solver results against those obtained using a simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) under the same time constraints, finding comparable liquidity savings for batch sizes of 70 and 140 payments. Subsequently, the SAA is extended to handle batch sizes of up to 700 payments, a scale that is challenging for current quantum hardware, demonstrating a more than tenfold increase in liquidity savings. Lastly, we introduce a machine learning framework to identify batch features that enhance liquidity savings with the CQM reordering algorithm. We find that batch optimizability increases with the number of participants acting as both senders and receivers, as well as the number of unique receivers within the batch."}}

We integrate institutional theory with a processual perspective to examine how stakeholders navigate competing institutional logics and shape PSM&apos;s legitimacy over time through an in-depth longitudinal case study in the pharmaceutical industry. Our analysis reveals three distinct developmental phases, each characterised by different configurations of institutional logics, forms of institutional work (defensive and enabling), and legitimacy dynamics. This study contributes to the literature exploring functional development within PSM in two important ways. First, we demonstrate that successful PSM development requires not the replacement of existing institutional logics but their hybridisation, achieved through institutional work that evolves from coercive to collaborative approaches over time. Second, we show how selective institutionalisation—achieving embedded influence in specific domains whilst accepting exclusion from others—may represent optimal accommodation in pluralistic organisational contexts. Our processual analysis reveals PSM development as an ongoing institutional accomplishment requiring continuous negotiation rather than linear progression toward a predetermined end state."}}

The study tested a model grounded in technology adoption theory, focusing on both enabling and inhibiting perceptions, and the professional environment as antecedents to GenAI use behavior. While the cross-sectional analysis yielded mixed results regarding the relationship between antecedents, trust and behavioral intention, all autoregressive paths for the key antecedents were statistically significant. However, contrary to expectations, the cross-lagged paths between constructs were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that the proposed directional influences between antecedents do not transfer to trust, behavioral intention and use behavior over time. The results highlight the complexity of GenAI adoption in higher education and call for further longitudinal research to better understand the conditions under which key factors translate into sustained use."}}

First, to effectively reflect driver behaviors in various sections of long tunnels (e.g., entrance/exit and middle sections), a multi-section intelligent driver model for long tunnels incorporating the effects of tunnel lighting is developed, which accounts for the influence of illuminance reduction coefficients at tunnel entrances/exits on driving behavior, as well as the impact of stroboscopic effects in the middle section on driver fatigue. Furthermore, a model analyzing the effects of variable speed limit control on drivers&apos; desired speed and acceleration is designed based on the microscopic traffic flow model. Second, a reinforcement learning-based multi-section variable speed limit control method is presented for long tunnels, to effectively capture heterogeneous traffic conditions while preventing dimensional explosion induced by microscopic traffic data, a macroscopic traffic state sampling method is developed, additionally, reward metrics based on microscopic vehicle trajectory data is formulated, including speed dispersion and average travel time, which can reflect the  traffic safety and operational efficiency  Finally, a simulation system is developed based on actual traffic data and tunnel illuminance data collected from the Beiru Tunnel in Shanxi Province to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that, under various traffic demand scenarios, the VSL control method significantly reduces the average inter-vehicle speed difference by 12.15%  and decreases the average travel time per vehicle by 6.61%  compared to fixed speed limit strategies."}}

The discussion is organized around the decision-making process of multinational firms, from choosing to operate internationally to selecting between greenfield investment and mergers. This framework reveals the theoretical and empirical evidence on the drivers of multinational production, including productivity gains, knowledge transfers, and market frictions. The findings highlight the commonality between the two literatures, but also suggests that greater integration between economic theory and finance research will generate a deeper understanding of the role of multinational firms in the global economy."}}

We present an open, Python-based pipeline that converts two decades (2000 – 2023) of satellite-derived loss trajectories for 56 pre-Hispanic sites in Peru’s peri-urban Chillón Valley into probabilistic collapse forecasts. After filtering for adequate temporal coverage, 33 sites were modelled with ordinary least-squares regressions whose parameter uncertainty was propagated through 10 000 Monte-Carlo draws. Under a business-as-usual assumption—recent degradation rates persist—median disappearance years and 95 % credible intervals place six sites as already lost, eight at high risk (< 15 years), and the remainder in mid- and late-century risk tiers. Kernel-density visualization of the full 2000 – 2025 loss record reveals three valley-wide degradation phases: initial stability (2000 – 2005), acceleration (2005 – 2015) and late-wave intensification (2015 – 2025). The framework shows how retrospective mapping and forward-looking uncertainty jointly prioritize intervention, while the peri-urban context cautions against uncritical generalization to dissimilar landscapes.

Assessing the impact of vegetation restoration on ET and its driving mechanisms is crucial for balancing ecological improvement and water resource management in the LP. This study employed the modified Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) model combined with a detrending method to estimate ET changes in six typical basins of the LP from 2000 to 2019. The PML model, after parameter calibration, showed good performance in ET simulation (NSE>0.8, R2>0.9) as validated by the PML_V2 dataset and water balance method. Results indicate that annual ET increased significantly in all six basins during the study period, with the Wuding River Basin showing the largest increase (3.50 mm/yr, p< 0.05). Summer ET accounted for more than 40% of the annual total, making it the primary contributor to annual ET variations. Leaf Area Index (LAI) exhibited the strongest correlation with ET, acting as the dominant driver of ET changes. The cumulative contribution of LAI linear growth induced by vegetation restoration to ET increases ranged from 357 to 493 mm across the basins. Spatially, the relatively humid Guanzhong Plain and southern basins (Beiluo and Fen River Basins) had the largest ET increases, while northern basins with limited precipitation (Kuye and Wuding River Basins) showed smaller increases, reflecting the regulatory role of water supply in ET dynamics. This study clarifies the impact of vegetation restoration on ET and hydrological processes in the LP, providing a scientific basis for optimizing vegetation restoration strategies and coordinating ecological protection with sustainable water resource management."}}

By embedding CI as a live KPI and linking MES data to ESG platforms via secure APIs, manufacturers can not only identify emissions anomalies but also trigger corrective action during operations.

In this mechanism, candidates (each of whom may have up to two traits for a given institution) are matched to two types of institutions: regular and boarding schools (i.e., institutions offering dormitory spots). We identify a key flaw in Parcoursup: institutional preferences are adjusted only once prior to the algorithm’s execution to incorporate affirmative action objectives. This static adjustment leads to violations of stability, even in simple matching environments.To address this, we propose a new mechanism, the Stage-Fair CDA (SF-CDA), which dynamically incorporates affirmative action using novel stable choice rules grounded in a social choice framework. Simulations based on Parcoursup 2022 data show that: (i) SF-CDA produces a stable outcome in 65% of instances and is always more stable than the current system, which is never stable; (ii) SF-CDA increases the number of reserved seats filled for each of two target traits (by 4.5% and 0.3%). Finally, we estimate that under the current system, approximately 8.6% of candidates (76,000) experience justified envy, whereas under SF-CDA this percentage would drop 40-fold to 0.2%."}}

Disaggregated analyses revealed clearer patterns: intrinsic motivation was negatively associated with procrastination, whereas extrinsic motivation showed no significant association. The relationship between motivation and procrastination was clearly demonstrated within the framework of Self-Determination Theory. Controlled motivation and amotivation were positively associated with procrastination, whereas autonomous motivation was negatively related to procrastinatory behaviors. Patterns also varied by procrastination type. Academic and passive procrastination shared similar patterns: negatively correlated with intrinsic and autonomous motivation, and positively correlated with extrinsic and controlled motivation. In contrast, active procrastination was positively associated with intrinsic and autonomous motivation and negatively associated with controlled motivation.

Firstly, we investigated the main failure modes in the wire bond process. Then we designed a full factorial experiment, and we performed effect analysis to find out the main factors affecting the defects, analyzed the main effects and interaction effects, and optimized the model to find the proper parameters setting. Finally, a confirmation run resulting in a 3.38% improvement in packaging yield. The methodology proposed offers a practical reference for optimizing the wire bond process in COB-type MicroSD packaging and enhancing overall manufacturing yield, which contributes to the advancement of high-reliability COB packaging for flash memory products."}}

Driven by chronic non-performing assets (NPAs), governance failures, and emerging risks such as cyber threats and digital banking vulnerabilities, India has gradually adapted global best practices-including the Basel accords and FDIC's CAMELS system-to its unique institutional context. The study employs illustrative cases (PMC Bank, Yes Bank, IL&amp;FS, DHFL) and RBI's interventions (Prompt Corrective Action, cyber guidelines) to demonstrate how each CAMELS C component functions in practice, highlighting sharper triggers for regulatory action and depositor safeguards. Empirical insights reveal how the CAMELS C framework helped preempt or mitigate crises by tying supervisory actions to breaches in capital, asset quality, and compliance norms. However, challenges persist in data gaps in smaller banks, subjective assessments of management and systems quality, and emerging overlaps with ESG and climate risk frameworks. The paper also discusses India's progression toward digital, risk-based supervision (RBS 2.0) that leverages big data and AI, and anticipates future integration of environmental and sustainability metrics, potentially evolving CAMELS C into a \"CAMELS E\" framework. Strategic recommendations call for the RBI to increase transparency by publishing more CAMELS-like indicators, strengthen data and cybersecurity oversight, and incorporate ESG risks systematically. Banks, especially PSBs and cooperatives , are urged to upgrade governance, proactively manage compliance, and stress-test for liquidity and cyber threats. Depositors and investors are advised to deepen their scrutiny beyond financial ratios to include governance and IT resilience. The overarching aim is to reinforce financial stability, depositor protection, and global confidence in India's banking sector through a more holistic supervisory architecture rooted in past lessons and future risks."}}

However, the effectiveness of penalties in achieving this objective remains unclear. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether higher penalties lead to more responsible operations using a large, granular dataset from the U.S. mining industry. Our identification strategy exploits a policy shock that sharply increased the penalty amounts for health and safety infractions in the mines. We find that higher penalties had, at best, a modest effect on responsible operations. While there was some decrease in violations, which was heterogeneous across mine types, we find no evidence of a decrease in accidents or injuries at mines that faced higher fines. We identify several mechanisms driving this null effect. First, the violations that decreased were unrelated to the root causes of accidents. Second, operational complexity does not explain the heterogeneity across mines, but labor market power does: penalties were least effective in counties where the mining industry is a dominant employer. Third, we identify an unanticipated and unintended consequence of higher penalties that compromised their effectiveness: mining companies strategically contested the higher fines in court, which led to discounted payments, delay in payment times, and an overflow of the court's operating capacity. By examining the mechanisms through which higher penalties (fail to) promote responsible operations, our work offers insights that can be generalized to contexts beyond mining (e.g., global supply chains)."}}

Equally compelling is the empirical insight that negotiation is far from a gender-neutral practice. Women face a well-documented double-bind in salary negotiations. They are often socially penalized for asserting themselves, which understandably makes many women hesitant to negotiate, and when they do negotiate, they frequently achieve worse outcomes than their male counterparts. What may appear on the surface as an individual’s “choice” or skill in negotiating is, in truth, heavily mediated by gendered social dynamics.

The problem is to determine the types and quantities of vehicles and assign them to regions. The objective is to minimize the total costs associated with transport and additional stop costs. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model to reflect practical logistics constraints. This proposes two matheuristic algorithms to solve this problem. The relax-and-fix heuristic constructs an initial solution by progressively relaxing and fixing subsets of decision variables, while the fix-and-optimize heuristic improves this solution through iterative local optimization, refixing certain variables.

Combat-related dementia is an underexplored yet increasingly relevant phenomenon of cognitive decline among military personnel exposed to combat stress, blast injuries, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study is to identify the main clinical and epidemiological variants of combat-related dementia and to construct a stratification model for predicting its progression. Methods. A retrospective, single-center cohort study included 206 veterans who underwent rehabilitation at the Nodus Neurorehabilitation Center between 2014 and 2024. The sample was stratified into three groups: (A) organic dementia following TBI; (B) dementia without TBI, PTSD, or organic brain changes; (C) dementia with a history of PTSD / blast trauma / psychotrauma. The mean cognitive status scores (MOCA/MMSE) were 23.4 (SD 2.7) in group A, 25.8 (SD 2.1) in group B, and 26.3 (SD 1.9) in group C; ERP and EEG parameters were analyzed in parallel. Ordinal and binary logistic regression were applied to identify risk factors. Results. Three clinically distinct trajectories of cognitive decline were identified. Group A exhibited an organic type of dementia with a clear correlation between MMSE scores and ERP markers. Group B showed a pattern of functional fronto-limbic decompensation with inconsistent electrophysiological dynamics. In group C, cognitive impairment manifested as functional fronto-limbic decompensation without distinct morphological substrate but with characteristic ERP alterations. The key prognostic factors were age and duration of deployment in combat zones: deployment exceeding 14 months was associated with nearly a threefold increase in the risk of dementia progression. Conclusions. A novel epidemiological model of combat-related dementia is proposed, conceptualizing it as a multifactorial cognitive syndrome combining both organic and functional impairments. The presented results may form the basis for future strategies of diagnostics and the development of both targeted veteran rehabilitation programs and broader health policy initiatives. The identified clinical phenotypes are essential for an interdisciplinary approach to cognitive screening, management, and prevention of dementia in military populations under conditions of modern hybrid warfare."}}

While some consumers may end up enjoying lower prices and having greater access to markets, other consumers will likely end up paying higher prices relative to the counterfactual, that is, a world without personalized pricing but likely some other forms of price discrimination. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that all consumers are made worse off relative to the counterfactual. Additionally, there are reasons that mitigate the concern that the practice of personalize pricing will grow. First, there could be competitive pressure to not engage in the practice—as firms that explicitly avoid personalized pricing will have a competitive advantage in the eyes of consumers. Relatedly, firms that do engage in personalized pricing will likely be stigmatized in the market, which creates a strong disincentive to widely adopt the practice."}}

The purpose of this exploration is to design and estimate a digital force chain control system that ensures price stability and translucency across the entire product trip from import to end-seller.. The methodology integrates qualitative approaches (stakeholder interviews, case studies of force chain vulnerabilities) with quantitative ways (real-time sale tracking algorithms, data analytics for force-demand matching) to develop a smart card-based monitoring result. Crucial findings demonstrate that this system effectively prevents stock manipulation by digitally recording every sale, automatically detecting disagreement, and enabling immediate nonsupervisory intervention. The exploration provides value by offering a scalable, tech-driven approach to strike black-demand networks while icing fair pricing. Still, limitations include perpetration costs, technological abandonment walls, and implicit resistance from settled syndicates. Practical counteraccusations suggest this model can empower governments with practicable request oversight tools while helping businesses operate further transparently. Social counteraccusations punctuate reduced profitable inequality, protection of low-income consumers from price shocks, and strengthened public trust in request systems. This study presents a replicable frame for developing nations floundering with analogous request manipulation challenges."}}

While disclosure sentiment is positively associated with short-window stock returns globally, the relationship is approximately 30% weaker for non-U.S. firms. Drawing on cultural accounting theory, we find that cultural differences play a central role in explaining this disparity. In terms of practical implications, we find that sentiment-based trading strategies are effective for U.S. firms and for non-U.S. firms operating in culturally similar environments, but <i>not </i>for firms from culturally distant countries. To address potential endogeneity, we use linguistic features as instrumental variables reflecting historical cultural values. Additionally, we apply a machine learning model trained on U.S. data, which continues to uncover cultural limitations when used internationally. Our findings underscore the importance of institutional and cultural context in international textual analysis and highlight the limitations of applying U.S.-centric empirical methods globally. The development of culturally sensitive and <i>contextualized</i> empirical approaches has the potential to advance the measurement and understanding of financial communication in international settings."}}

Common approaches for modeling these goals include complex, difficult-to-estimate fleet usage costs. In this paper, we simplify the modeling of such cost structures by introducing an easy-to-understand minimum truckload utilization rule that aligns well with best practices in real-world delivery scenarios. We formulate the multi-period vehicle routing problem with minimum utilization constraints (MPVRP-MUC) to create efficient routes while minimizing unfulfilled customer requests within the desired delivery periods. We ensure feasibility despite fixed minimum vehicle loads by allowing request shifts to future periods. We decompose the MPVRP-MUC by periods and solve each single-period VRP-MUC by a Hybrid Genetic Search algorithm (HGS-VRP-MUC). This integrates a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) procedure along with a repair mechanism to maintain solution feasibility. The numerical study shows that the HGS-VRP-MUC approach continuously achieves optimal results for instances with up to 80 customers. Furthermore, we conduct multi-period simulations to analyze the influence of minimum utilization constraints, where the number of vehicles over 10 periods can be reduced by up to 12%, and the total distance is reduced by 3.5% while still serving over 90% of the total demand in every period."}}

A major challenge in these formulations lies in efficiently generating high-quality integer solutions from a model with exponentially many variables. We propose a hybrid restricted master heuristic that combines column generation with a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to improve solution quality in these settings. The method first uses dynamic programming-based pricing to generate routes guided by dual variables from the linear relaxation. It then applies GRASP to complete partial solutions and introduce new routes that complement those with positive reduced costs, thereby improving column complementarity before solving the resulting model as a mixed-integer program. This integration leverages both the global guidance of column generation and the diversification strength of GRASP. We illustrate the approach on the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands, where customer demands are modeled as random variables revealed upon arrival. Experimental results on 40 benchmark instances with up to 60 customers show that the method reliably produces high-quality solutions, achieving optimality gaps below 5% in all cases and averaging under 2% within 5 minutes of computation, with a higher proportion of best solutions returned than any other variant considered.Keywords: vehicle routing, stochastic demands, restricted master heuristic,GRASPEmail addressesgael-simon.reynal@polymtl.ca (Ga¨el REYNAL), quentin.cappart@polymtl.ca (Quentin CAPPART), guy.desaulniers@polymtl.ca(Guy DESAULNIERS), louis-martin.rousseau@polymtl.ca (Louis-Martin ROUSSEAU)Preprint submitted to Computers and Operations Research July 17, 2025mark instances with up to 60 customers show that the method reliably produces high-quality solutions, achieving optimality gaps below 5% in all cases and averaging under 2% within 5 minutes of computation, with a higher proportion of best solutions returned than any other variant considered."}}

These challenges are particularly acute in sectors such as fashion, where SKU alternation, high customization, and dynamic production requirements complicate operational resilience. To address these complexities, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) application framework aimed at identifying and mitigating operational disruptions. The framework was validated through a case study in the fashion industry, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing disruptions such as machine failures and quality issues. From a theoretical perspective, the study classifies disruptions within Supply Chain Operations Management (SCOM) dimensions, distinguishing between operational and supply chain levels. Furthermore, the framework contributes to the ongoing discourse on DTs by offering validated insights into their role in managing operational disruptions in mixed-model assembly lines. More broadly, it situates itself within the ongoing conversation on how Industry 4.0 technologies, such as DTs, act as enablers for the transition toward Industry 5.0. Specifically, this study underscores the role of DTs as key facilitators of resilience, a foundational pillar of Industry 5.0. From a managerial perspective, company’s performance is improved through the proposed structured approach to managing disruptions. By integrating information across systems and transforming raw data into actionable insights, it enhances resilience through informed decision-making and recovery action evaluation via simulation-optimization. This focus on resilience and optimization positions the framework as a comprehensive tool for navigating the complexities of modern production environments. Future research could expand its applicability to supply chain-level disruptions, broadening its impact across key supply chain nodes."}}

(2) How can the issue of multiple weight solutions in the DEA-CCR model be resolved when decision-making units achieve an efficiency score of one, while maintaining ranking stability? To answer these questions, we construct the UNISON framework as follows. First, a knowledge-driven DEA-CCR model is used to evaluate project efficiencies. Second, cross-efficiency sensitivity analysis identifies and adjusts invariant weights and slack variables to stabilize rankings. Third, a multidimensional knapsack formulation integrates each project’s development duration and available R&D capacity into a single optimization problem. A case study of 15 candidate projects from a Taiwanese semiconductor IC design service firm validates this framework. The results demonstrate that, compared to the conventional GPM-oriented method, UNISON achieves a 3.71% increase in total revenue, attains the highest ratings in technological depth and breadth, and effectively alleviates scheduling bottlenecks."}}

To meet the increasing demand for high-brightness, high-resolution LED applications, Surface Mount Technology (SMT) has become indispensable in LED manufacturing. However, the high-mix, low-volume nature of LED production has made SMT processes increasingly complex. To enhance production efficiency and shorten lead times, this study proposes a Hybrid Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm with Tabu Search (HFGATS) to optimize SMT scheduling, which can be characterized as a flow shop scheduling problem (FSSP). Previous studies on FSSP seldom consider the combination of factors such as material availability, production line balancing, machine availability, designated machine constraints and dependent setup time constraints. This study addresses this gap by incorporating real-world production factors, integrating fuzzy logic controllers to dynamically adjust scheduling parameters, and deploying tabu search as a local search mechanism to enhance adaptability to practical manufacturing environments. Through empirical validation in a Taiwanese LED manufacturing company, results demonstrate that the proposed HFGATS can effectively find near-optimal solutions, significantly reduce tardiness, and improve resource utilization and production efficiency."}}

Optimizing reservoir operations is crucial for effective water management, maintaining a balance among multiple objectives such as energy generation, irrigation, flood control, and ecological sustainability.

Using hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization and Grey Wolf Optimization (PSOGWO) algorithm, this study analyzes the optimized operation under seven choices for e-flow assessment method. The results show that e-flow allocations vary, with DOED and MMFM prioritizing energy output (3318 and 3291 GWh, respectively) but risking environmental degradation, while methods such as Tessman method lower total energy by 35% due to high environmental release. In dewatered reach, post-dam flow alteration (up to -38% in wet-season) can have both positive and negative impact in downstream ecosystems until the confluence with the Sunkoshi River. This study underscores the need for detailed analysis of hydrology, downstream impacts, and aquatic biology, while recommending MMFM and ADM for their balance of operational efficiency and environmental protection.

While policy makers often assert that the housing insecure are better served in scattered site housing in low poverty neighborhoods, we find that residents have good reasons to prefer staying in public housing. To the extent that the residents prefer to move out of public housing, we find that in our sample, preferences for moving out of site based housing is driven by poor experiences with management and not because of geographic access to services or relationships with neighbors. This suggests that public housing facilities could be improved through investments in public housing management-occupant relations. We conclude that surveys of public housing residents could allow policy makers to take a proactive approach to addressing residents’ issues while drawing on strengths of current facilities, rather than applying a one size fits all public housing policy based on historic policy issues."}}

However, carbon markets are characterized by strong nonlinearity, non-stationarity, and intertwined multiple factors, limiting the accuracy of existing models. To address this, this study proposes the moCEEMDAN-Attention-BiLSTM-Random Forest hybrid model, with key improvements and advantages as follows:First, the improved moCEEMDAN decomposes carbon price data from Hubei and Guangdong. Combined with sample entropy, it reconstructs components into high- and low-frequency sequences, effectively resolving mode mixing in raw signals and enhancing targeted feature extraction.Second, Random Forest is introduced for feature selection, eliminating redundancy to simplify the model and improve input effectiveness.The constructed Attention-BiLSTM-Random Forest framework focuses on key time-series features via the attention mechanism and optimizes nonlinear fitting through Random Forest, significantly boosting prediction accuracy.Additionally, the Morris method and multi-scenario simulations enable dynamic sensitivity analysis and reveal carbon price fluctuation patterns, breaking the limitations of static forecasting.Results confirm that the model exhibits significant advantages in prediction accuracy and dynamic feature analysis. It provides a new technical path and theoretical support for carbon price forecasting, offers a scientific basis for policy-making and market decisions, and holds important practical value for promoting stable carbon market development."}}

Efficiently leveraging external multi-energy markets while flexibly mobilizing internal multiple agents to enhance energy efficiency, remedy supply shortfalls, and achieve precise carbon-emission control thus holds significant research value. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-layer game-theoretic model incorporating carbon-emission factors to optimize both external and internal operations of PIES. First, an energy–carbon coupled emission accounting model is developed to explicitly capture carbon-emission transfers resulting from multi-agent energy transactions, enabling accurate system-wide carbon accounting. Second, a Stackelberg game model is formulated to optimize interactions between the upper-level energy network and park systems, while a cooperative game model is constructed to attain internal optimization within PIES. In addition, a multi-agent cooperative game revenue-allocation mechanism is designed to quantify each agent’s marginal contribution to the alliance’s economic and environmental benefits. Multi-scenario simulations demonstrate that cooperation among PIES markedly improves internal supply–demand matching, reduces carbon-emission intensity, and enhances competitiveness in the upper-level Stackelberg game, thereby harmonizing economic and low-carbon objectives."}}

DPRR utilizes route reservations and applies dynamic pricing as a control mechanism to implicitly affect users&apos; decision-making, aiming to yield desirable traffic conditions aligned with various user- or system-oriented objectives. At the same time, numerous spatiotemporal route options are available to users any time, providing them with the desired freedom of choice.

Satisfaction within a group is defined as the outcome of weighted positive feedback received from interpersonal interactions over time. Individuals store feedback in memory, and recent feedback is weighted higher, leading to satisfaction being dynamically influenced by recent experiences. Hence, satisfaction within a group is shaped by interpersonal interactions, memory, and learning, while attraction to other groups arises from shared knowledge about the satisfaction levels of members in those groups, transmitted through the social network.Using agent-based modeling, we simulate how these forces influence individual behavior, group cohesion, and the formation of broader social patterns. The model examines how individuals weigh their current satisfaction against perceived benefits in other groups, leading to decisions about whether to stay or migrate. Tested across Fully Connected (FC) and Preferential Attachment (PA) network structures, this approach provides insights into the dynamics of group formation and migration, with applications for understanding collective behavior in various social and environmental contexts."}}

To address this, a cascading failure mitigation control method considering load prioritization is proposed. A control model integrating load grading with cascading failure analysis and multi-stage blocking strategies is established. Initial fault identification is conducted based on voltage fluctuation, load rate, and branch power proportion. Functional indicators, including power flow limit violations and transmission efficiency, and structural indicators, such as line betweenness and network average efficiency, are selected. A combined weighting strategy based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is employed to determine the fault propagation paths. The multi-stage blocking strategy aims to minimize the probability of cascading failures and associated losses by adjusting generator outputs, curtailing renewable energy, and shedding non-critical loads. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model effectively reduces system losses and fault probabilities at each stage while ensuring uninterrupted power supply to critical loads, validating the economic and reliable performance of the control strategy."}}

Anchored in social support theory and psychological safety research, this study examines the influence of perceived friendship support on stress among undergraduate business students. Drawing on a convergent mixed-methods study of 443 students, including both quantitative survey data and qualitative narrative responses, this study shows that friendship-support satisfaction significantly predicts lower stress, with psychological safety serving as a partial mediator. Thematic analysis reveals three key mechanisms: emotional sanctuary, collective efficacy, and positive emotional spirals.

The BA revealed that existing research is scarce, relates to a small number of researchers, universities, journals, and countries. However, the academic interest is growing, as evidenced by an upsurge in citations and publication trends. The SLR revealed that prior literature is incongruent due to several reasons, including the dissimilar operationalization of key constructs and insufficient attention to the different numerical representations of female directors (tokenism and critical mass), as well as their personal educational and professional attributes. The inclusion or exclusion of important aspects closely related to the BGD and CSP, or their association, relying more on moderation than mediation, dissimilarity in moderators, mediators, and regression estimators, and an exclusive focus on quantitative research (overlooking qualitative and mixed methods research) are other reasons for the prior inconsistent findings. Underrepresentation of some countries and sectors, rarely probed variations in county-specific characteristics (such as governance quality, human development indicators, legal, political, social, cultural, and religious factors) despite the context sensitive nature of the inquiry, and addressing endogeneity in a limited number of studies, with different internal and external IVs may also be the rationales behind previous incongruent outcomes.

By examining these governance and strategic factors together, the paper aims to enhance understanding of how internal organizational elements shape global market engagement.Design:  The empirical analysis utilizes an unbalanced panel dataset of 22,098 firm-year observations from 2015 to 2022 across four major global regions. A panel Tobit regression model is applied to address the censored nature of the dependent variable (internationalization ratio). The study explores both direct and interaction effects, incorporating linear and non-linear specifications while conducting robustness checks through alternative models and subsample analyses based on ESG and diversity quartiles.Findings: The results indicate that ESG performance and board gender diversity have a positive influence on firm internationalization. However, the relationship between gender diversity and internationalization is inverted U-shaped, showing diminishing returns beyond a certain point. While aggregate model interaction effects between ESG and gender diversity are not statistically significant, subsample analyses reveal that high ESG performance enhances the positive impact of board diversity, and vice versa.Originality: The paper contributes to the international business and corporate governance literature by demonstrating that the effects of ESG and gender diversity on internationalization are non-linear and context-dependent, highlighting the need for integrated governance approaches that align sustainability and inclusion with strategic international goals."}}

We provide novel evidence that firms with higher climate change exposure are likely to reduce their corporate risk-taking. Our baseline results remain robust and consistent when applying entropy balancing to our sample, utilizing a quasi-natural experiment based on the Paris Agreement as an exogenous shock, and employing an instrumental variable approach. Next, as a novel contribution, we identify two separate transmission mechanisms, i.e., investment behavior and environmental practices, through which climate change exposure affects corporate risk-taking. Higher exposure leads to lower R&D intensity and improved investment efficiency, while also enhancing environmental performance and innovation, all of which contribute to more prudent risk-taking behavior. Finally, we provide novel evidence that information asymmetry and governance positively moderate the negative association between climate change exposure and corporate risk-taking. This finding suggests that stronger governance and reduced information asymmetry (higher transparency) at both the firm and country level can attenuate the negative impact of climate change exposure on corporate risk-taking. Overall, our results suggest that while climate change exposure tends to reduce corporate risk-taking, the strength of this effect substantially depends on the informational and governance context in which firms operate."}}

However, actual conditions during operation very often differ from the nominal ones, which degrade the real performance of PT. Current adaptation approaches consist in corrective actions, such as stop-skipping, which are ineffective faced with large or frequent condition deviations. In those cases, an approach for a deeper redesign of the network might be needed.%This paper is the first to introduce a framework to redesign a PT network in real time, to keep high user- and operator-related performance, even when faced with highly uncertain traffic conditions. To this aim, we adopt a predict-then-optimize approach: PT lines are redesigned to adapt to predicted traffic conditions, via an effective algorithm based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III. We avoid excessive network modifications, by ensuring high Jaccard similarity between the original network and the redesigned one. To account for the impact of the prediction errors in the quality of the redesigned network, we fit an error model on a Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network on real data.%Results on the Mandl&apos;s network show improvements of up to 97% passenger travel time and 37% operational cost, while preserving 79\\% of the original network structure, compared to the optimal nominal static network. These results suggest the importance of going beyond the inflexibility of current PT design approaches, toward a continuous and adaptive redesign."}}

Unlike the Global North, which benefits from targeted regulations and institutional capacities to effectively monitor ESG reporting, the paper observes that the Global South, including Ghana, faces significant challenges in optimizing corporate partnerships for adaptation initiatives. In this regard, the paper advances an enhanced ESG reporting framework that integrates the concept of double materiality by embedding community resilience initiatives into corporate sustainability strategies.

We test our framework using a panel of 457 publicly listed U.S. firms over 15 years (2007-2021), comprising 19,340 firm-quarter observations. We find that ESG performance is negatively associated with product innovation and that this relationship depends on three contextual factors. R&amp;D intensity enables better capability alignment mitigating the negative association. Firms that face intense competition are better equipped to innovate due to external pressures to differentiate their products. In contrast, high ROA that carries more resource slack implies that firms may become more risk-averse, reinforcing the negative effect. Our findings shed light on the hidden and unintended consequences of ESG performance and offer guidance on how firms can align purpose with innovation ambition."}}

(1)There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between AI application levels and firms&apos; GTFP, which remains robust after a series of robustness checks. (2)Regarding the mediating effect, AI promotes the green transformation of firm management, thereby enhancing green productivity; however, as the degree of AI application deepens, the efficiency of green technology research and development will decrease, which will hinder the continuous improvement of green total factor productivity. (3)In terms of the moderating effect, the talent aggregation in the firm&apos;s region and higher levels of corporate governance weaken the inverted U-shaped relationship between AI and GTFP, making the relationship curve flatter. (4)Concerning heterogeneity, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in firms with high environmental regulation, high emissions, and high financing constraints. Corporate governance exerts a better moderating effect in firms with low environmental regulation, low emissions, and low financing constraints; whereas regional talent aggregation plays a more significant moderating role in firms with high environmental regulation, high emissions, and low financing constraints. (5)Through a macro-level mapping analysis of firms&apos; AI applications, it is found that the inverted U-shaped relationship between AI and GTFP can better explain the two distinct mechanisms at the regional level, rooted in differences in regional factor mobility and inter-firm connectivity."}}

Conventionally tilled soils had ≥59% lower soil matric potential (less moisture; P>F = 5.41×10−8) than conservation practices before irrigation. Cover crops increased soil moisture (-20 kPa) compared to winter fallow (-34 kPa). All conservation practices improved season-long soil moisture by ≥-19 kPa over conventional tillage (P>F = 3.8×10−12). Each Mg ha−1 increase in preplant biomass raised soil matric potential by ≥7.3 kPa. Irrigation at -80 kPa to replenish soil moisture did not alter treatment differences. The conventional method (control) required irrigation every year with up to 7.81cm more supplemental irrigation than the studied conservation practices. Cover crop treatments did not require irrigation at least 2 out of the 3 seasons in the experiment. Cost savings from reduced irrigation of up to $18 ha-1 do not fully compensate for crop yield penalties. Infiltration rates on bed tops increased by 23% with cover crops (P>F = 0.0627).

When applying metamodeling techniques to principle-based VA portfolio valuation, selecting a representative sample with clear and explainable criteria is necessary. The proposed approach involves (i) training a surrogate neural network with existing valuations for the same portfolio across multiple market scenarios and (ii) decomposing the overall risk of a VA contract into clearly separated contributions from each risk driver using SHapley Additive exPlanations. This decomposition results in an informative and explainable representation of the VA contract data, which can later be used to select the representative sample under a new market scenario. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the surrogate neural network with the selected representative sample, the proposed method offers a systematic way to improve the neural network’s performance in the new market scenario. Our numerical analyses show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods in the existing literature in prediction accuracy and goodness of fit."}}

Contrary to the intuitive expectation of a positive green premium, we find no evidence that climate-friendly products are priced higher. In some product categories, products with better climate scores are in fact associated with lower prices, suggesting a negative premium-an outcome that gives rise to what we refer to as the green premium puzzle. We argue that market frictions-such as competing consumer priorities, psychological distance from climate issues, and skepticism toward environmental labeling-may suppress the price signals intended to reward sustainable consumption. These findings offer important insights for producers, retailers, and policymakers seeking to align climate goals with effective market incentives in the transition toward a more sustainable society."}}

The narrative originates with the historic 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a World Bank-brokered agreement that apportioned the river's waters and has, for decades, served as a fragile instrument of peace. The text examines the treaty's initial success and the subsequent erosion of its authority, citing the contentious development of dams such as Kishanganga and Baglihar as key points of friction. \n<br>\n<br>\n A significant portion of the work is dedicated to a detailed examination of a hypothetical 2025 crisis, triggered by a terror attack in Pahalgam, which leads to India's suspension of the treaty. This event precipitates a rapid escalation of military and diplomatic tensions. The book meticulously explores the practical implications of India's strategy to control the water flow, presenting a technical assessment of its existing dam infrastructure and its limited capacity for substantial water storage. \n<br>\n<br>\n Furthermore, the study delves into the profound humanitarian and economic consequences for Pakistan, a nation where the Indus system sustains over 90% of its agriculture and supports 40% of its workforce. The potential for severe food shortages, widespread blackouts, and famine is critically assessed. The analysis is compounded by the looming threat of climate change, which introduces greater unpredictability through extreme flooding and drought cycles. \n<br>\n<br>\n Distinct from conventional political histories of the India-Pakistan conflict, this book integrates historical context with rigorous technical and economic data. It provides a nuanced, balanced perspective that scrutinizes the feasibility of unilateral actions and their far-reaching impacts. Concluding with a forward-looking approach, the book proposes a range of solutions, including the renegotiation of the treaty, the implementation of more efficient water management practices, and the fostering of bilateral cooperation. This work is intended for policymakers, scholars, and a general audience seeking a deeply informed, multifaceted understanding of one of the world's most critical water disputes."}}

This study introduces an AI-driven predictive zonal heating model that utilizes synthetic occupant behavioral data generated by ChatGPT to optimize room-level heating. The model achieves next-state prediction accuracies of 64.68% for single occupant households and 73.20% for family households. TRNSYS-based simulations conducted for ten cities across Europe and the United States indicate that heating demand varies significantly with building material, with timber constructions exhibiting the lowest energy consumption and stone constructions the highest. A comparative evaluation of three HVAC strategies, including traditional continuous heating (BAU), manual smart control (S1), and the proposed AI-based zoning system (S2), shows that S2 reduces energy consumption by up to 73.16% for single-occupant households and 46.35% for family households relative to BAU. Compared with S1, S2 delivers additional savings of 40.83% to 67.63% for single occupants and 15.02% to 22.15% for families. Over a four-week simulation, single-occupant households achieved weekly energy cost savings of 29.71 to 72.49 USD and carbon emission reductions of 1.64 to 80.23 kg CO₂, while family households achieved savings of 30.05 to 80.38 USD and reductions of 1.73 to 74.38 kg CO₂. These results demonstrate the potential of AI-enabled zonal heating to significantly improve energy efficiency, mitigate environmental impact, and enhance occupant comfort without manual intervention."}}

While previous studies have broadly analyzed general correlations between financial resources and athletic success, this research narrows the scope to assess how specific factors-including but not limited to NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) funding, ticket revenue, return on investment, and revenue-relate to team winning percentages. The research question is: What are the winning percentages of college basketball teams in the Big East Conference, in relation to their economics (tax dollars paid, tuition, or revenue made from sports events)? This topic is especially relevant as NIL policies and changing revenue structures are reshaping college athletics. To answer this question, a correlational research design and quantitative method were used to conduct the research by gathering economic data and analyzing the relationship between financial investment and winning percentages. The findings suggest that while general financial investment does not guarantee higher winning percentages, targeted spending-particularly in areas like NIL deals and athletic-specific contributions-has a stronger correlation with success. These results are important because they can help athletic directors, administrators, and policymakers optimize both team success and economic gain by understanding the key factors that contribute to performance."}}

Conversely, the outflow of renewable energy firms positively influences PUR in origin regions. The outflow of advanced materials firms boosts PIC not only locally but also in adjacent provinces. The relocation effects of equipment manufacturing firms—both inflows and outflows—mirror those observed in the renewable energy sector, underscoring the strong interdependence between these two industries. The inflow of IT firms not only enhances local PUR but also produces significant spatial spillover effects, raising PUR in neighboring provinces. This effect is particularly pronounced in western provinces participating in the “Eastern Data, Western Computing” initiative, highlighting the electricity-intensive characteristics of high-energy-demand industries."}}

In this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework for analyzing decentralized insurance ecosystems with respect to risk distribution efficiency and participant incentives in trustless environments. We employ Nash equilibrium and utility maximization principles to derive optimal premium and payout structures, integrating blockchain’s transparency and immutability as key enablers. A numerical simulation with 100 agents across 1,000 iterations reveals that decentralized insurance achieves up to 20% higher efficiency than centralized models, with reduced adverse selection and administrative costs. Sensitivity analyses explore the impact of risk heterogeneity, reputation scores, and blockchain transaction costs on system performance. The results highlight significant advantages in equity and cost-effectiveness but underscore challenges such as scalability, governance, and moral hazard. Theoretical contributions include a novel application of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory to Insurtech, while practical implications suggest pathways for integrating decentralized insurance into regulatory frameworks and blockchain platforms. This study bridges gaps in the literature on decentralized finance (DeFi) and insurance economics, offering a robust foundation for future empirical validations. We conclude with recommendations for hybrid models combining centralized oversight with decentralized execution, addressing limitations in current blockchain infrastructure."}}

Courts struggle to explain what rights shareholders possess, what duties directors owe, and whose authority controls when shareholders and management disagree. When directors routinely refuse shareholder demands in operational decisions or governance disputes, legal theory and doctrine offer confused metaphors about “ownership” and “control” rather than analytical precision about rights and duties.</p>\n<p>This doctrinal crisis reflects a deeper theoretical failure. Legal relations involving multiple parties within organizational structures operate beyond the analytical boundaries that our existing individual-focused rights theory has established. From corporate governance disputes to partnership conflicts, from international organizations to trust administration, the law lacks the theoretical framework necessary to describe how rights function when groups act collectively.</p>\n<p>This Article proposes a theoretical framework to fill this void by using corporate law as a case study. The central discovery is that aggregate legal relations require new conceptions of rights that defy traditional bilateral arrangements.</p>\n<p>When directors manage corporate assets, they owe <i>compound duties</i> to the corporation that legally require consideration of shareholder interests without making shareholders the primary rightsholders. Shareholders correspondingly possess <i>participatory rights</i>—not rights that would enable outcome control, but legally protected interests in the decision-making process, which otherwise serves the corporation as the primary rightsholder. The shareholders enjoy <i>participatory privileges</i> to actively engage in the governance of the firm, while customers, employees, and other third parties have <i>participatory no-rights</i> to legally interfere with that freedom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The policy implications of the participatory rights architecture are broad and impactful. Using corporate law as a test case for the proposed theory’s normative value, the Article demonstrates how one can resolve corporate law’s most persistent puzzles by applying this theory. The notorious direct-derivative lawsuit distinction becomes straightforward: derivative suits enforce corporate rights, and direct suits enforce shareholder traditional and participatory rights. The perplexing doctrines of controlling shareholder obligations become the systematic conversion of participatory privileges into compound duties. The boundaries of corporate limited liability are drawn by references to the rights structures that shareholders assume.</p>\n<p>This Article thus provides both theoretical breakthrough and doctrinal transformation, offering the tools necessary to understand how rights operate in corporate law specifically, and laws of legal organizations more broadly.</p>"}}

Drawing on administrative data from the Texas Workforce Commission, Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys, unemployment insurance claims patterns, and comparative interstate fiscal analysis, this research demonstrates that Texas's celebrated employment growth depends critically on factors unrelated to the conservative policy prescriptions commonly attributed as causal mechanisms. The analysis reveals that government hiring accounts for approximately 26% of job gains, net in-migration inflates employment statistics by 25-30%, and seasonal adjustment procedures systematically misrepresent actual labor market conditions. More significantly, supposed fiscal conservatism primarily involves sophisticated cost-shifting mechanisms that transfer employment and service responsibilities from state to local governments, creating efficiency illusions while increasing aggregate tax burdens through property assessments and local fees. These findings suggest that policy prescriptions based on superficial analysis of Texas employment statistics may be built on methodologically questionable foundations, with implications extending beyond Texas to fundamental questions about evidence-based economic policy evaluation in federal systems. The research contributes to understanding how statistical complexity, federal institutional structures, and political incentives interact to create systematic biases in regional economic development assessment."}}

This study develops a novel Multi-Actor Techno-Economic Assessment (MATEA) framework to evaluate offshore wind decommissioning scenarios, explicitly integrating the diverging interests of wind farm owners and marine contractors. Grounded in a collaborative industry-informed approach, this framework is applied to a Belgian offshore wind case study. Results demonstrate that choices about how to carry out removal, such as vessel selection and dismantling methods, tend to have a greater influence on costs than what must be removed from the seabed. The removal of turbine foundations represents the most expensive process for wind farm owners, while also generating the highest profits for marine contractors, revealing split incentives that may hinder collaborative decision-making. Weather-related delays are identified as the largest source of economic uncertainty for wind farm owners, due to their direct exposure to extended offshore operations. In addition, vessel day rates emerge as a critical cost driver, with limited vessel availability amplifying price-setting power for marine contractors. These findings challenge the prevailing perception that full removal of offshore infrastructure is economically prohibitive and highlight the need for regulatory clarity based on operational and technical realities rather than cost assumptions. The proposed framework provides a transparent basis for evaluating decommissioning strategies, contributing to more robust financial planning, risk management, and sustainable end-of-life practices in offshore renewable energy."}}

The US political system is highly unequal as policy preferences of high-income citizens are often prioritized compared to low-income groups. It is also widely believed that interest groups employ campaign contributions to exercise bargaining power over political candidates. Evidence shows that stricter campaign contribution laws can reduce the bargaining power of interest groups over candidates and increase the say of low-income groups in policy matters. Thus, the effect of stricter contribution laws should also manifest as a shift towards relatively generous welfare policies. This paper analyzes the relationship between stricter campaign contribution laws and welfare policy across the statewide legislative races from 1980 to 2018. The empirical results indicate that stricter contribution laws increase state real minimum wage and EITC rates. The effect of relatively stringent laws on welfare policy generosity is also evident when alternative welfare policy proxies are used."}}

By employing the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG) estimator, alongside the recently developed Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) approach as a robustness check, the empirical results suggest the following. (i) RET, GTI, and ICT contribute to the improvement of ecological conditions by enhancing LCF and mitigating EFP in the GCC nations. (ii) Population density and natural resources rent lead to environmental pollution by decreasing LCF and increasing EFP. (iii) The validation of the inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) assumption is evident when it is analyzed from the perspective of EFP, while the U-shaped load capacity curve (LCC) assumption is supported through the framework of LCF. Finally, with gradual advancements in the GTI and ICT sectors, the environmental benefits of RET have become increasingly evident. In light of these findings, policymakers in GCC economies are encouraged to leverage technological innovations and ICT in the energy transition process to improve the ecological conditions and achieve sustainable development goals."}}

Exceptions are useful to international law theorising because they create easy manageable narratives which explain situations not fitting traditional paradigms, yet as a category in their own right-specifically how they are structured and how they operate-, they are often undertheorized. The two examples explored in this article are sui generis actors and the concept of extraterritorial jurisdiction. I demonstrate the foundational role played by (state-)territorialized thinking in the creation of oppositional categories: state and non-state and the non-exceptional and exceptional exercise of jurisdiction. The category of exceptions has significantly expanded from the likes of the Holy See and irregular exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction to a broad array of actors, such as international organizations and transnational corporations, playing growing and varied roles in contemporary law-making and governance and the regular exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by states. Rather than continuing with this overextended category, the article argues it is instead possible, by rethinking international law's spatial imaginary, to first, better understand the spaces of non-state actors and regularized exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction and second, eradicate the now overstretched legal category of 'sui generis'."}}

This exogenous shock allows us to examine whether firms that experienced an increase or decrease in their ratings solely due to the methodological change also saw significant changes in their breadth of ownership. We find that firms with increased ratings saw a significant rise in the number of individual investors. Further tests show that firms' visibility and stock familiarity are the main drivers of individual investors' reaction. Conversely, the breadth of institutional investors is unaffected by the change in the rating methodology. Our study contributes to the literature by highlighting the critical role of ESG raters in shaping investor behavior and providing insights into the underlying mechanisms."}}

Using simulated data with known functional relationships, I demonstrate how to identify important features and understand their directional effects using model-agnostic interpretation tools. Three complementary approaches for measuring feature importance are examined: built-in measures, permutation importance, and SHAP-based methods. For understanding directional relationships, I show how partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, and SHAP values with bootstrapped confidence intervals can reveal both average effects and heterogeneity across observations. These tools successfully recover the known nonlinear relationships in the simulated data, including quadratic terms, exponential functions, and interaction effects, without requiring researchers to specify functional forms a priori. The interpretation methods build naturally on familiar econometric concepts such as marginal effects, bootstrapping, and statistical significance testing, making them accessible to applied researchers. Rather than replacing traditional econometric reasoning, these tools extend it, particularly when relationships are nonlinear or unknown. This framework enables economists to harness the predictive power of machine learning while preserving the interpretability and inferential standards central to empirical research."}}

These effects are not driven by beliefs about karma or magical thinking, but by the strategic use of altruism as a moral excuse: men use it to justify risk-taking, women to justify restraint. We formalize this mechanism into a structural model of altruistic utility that accounts for individual attitudes toward risk and estimate it using incentivized measures of altruism and optimism.

In the GDR, the women inventor rate was even lower in the 1950s, but it increased to about 17 per cent in the 1980s. A plausible reason for this development is the GDR's women's policy due to the general labor shortage, which, among other things, tried to integrate women into universities and R&amp;D departments of state-owned enterprises, thus promoting female inventorship."}}

Departing from previous reviews that often focus on a single task or model architecture, this paper introduces an innovative and unified classification framework from the perspective of training cost and data dependency. We categorize existing approaches into three paradigms: Zero-shot, Fine-tuning, and Train-from-scratch. Based on this framework, we conduct a comprehensive cross-task comparative analysis of over one hundred representative studies, revealing the intrinsic trade-offs among computational overhead, data requirements, performance ceilings, and application flexibility inherent to each paradigm. Furthermore, the survey synthesizes the primary bottlenecks facing diffusion models—including sampling efficiency, controllability, and multi-modal integration—and outlines key future research directions, such as unified multi-degradation models, efficient sampling strategies, and the fusion of physics-based priors. This work aims to offer researchers and practitioners in the computer vision community a structured, data-rich, and valuable reference guide."}}

Combining administrative data on FTS coverage with municipal labor force panel data (2017–2022), we estimate a dose-response model within a difference-in-differences framework. Results indicate that the termination of FTS reduced household income by 40%, with no clear reduction in hours worked, consistent with a shift toward lower-paid, informal jobs. Informal employment increased by 8.7 percentage points, particularly among households lacking flexible caregiving alternatives. Single-parent households experienced the largest income losses (59.7%), while the presence of older siblings or domestic workers provided only partial buffering. Co-residence with grandmothers had no significant effect. These findings underscore the role of formal childcare in supporting household income and limiting reliance on informal work."}}

Firms with a greater proportion of financially skilled executives on the TMT are more likely to engage in tax avoidance activities. Next, our channel analysis reveals that top executives with experience in non-regulatory-oriented financial institutions are more likely to engage in tax avoidance, whereas those with backgrounds in regulatoryoriented institutions (i.e., stock exchanges, policy banks, or regulatory commissions) exhibit no significant effect. Cross-sectional analyses further reveal that institutional shareholders amplify the tax aggressiveness associated with financially expert executives having experience in non-regulatoryoriented institutions, and that these executives are more likely to intensify tax avoidance following regulatory sanctions, as a strategy to preserve firm value or recover from reputational setbacks. Finally, we find that tax avoidance initiatives led by financially expert executives are more effectively translated into enhanced future firm value."}}

Corroborating this approach, these school quality estimates prove to be highly correlated with provincial cognitive skill test scores for the same demographic group. Returns to quality increase with economic development level of destination cities. Importantly, quality appears higher and provincial variation appears lower for younger cohorts, indicating at least partial effectiveness of more recent policies aimed at improving rural school quality across provinces. Surprisingly, however, provincial variations in quality are uncorrelated with teacher-student ratio or per student spending."}}

This paper proposes an automated, replicable and efficient methodology to delineate labour market boundaries integrating information from night-time and daytime satellite imagery and using image segmentation. To validate our approach, we compare our satellite-based labour market boundaries against existing areas based on commonly used methods and definitions using commuting flow data. Our methodology generates a similar set of labor market areas that more precisely identifies differences in terms of economic outcomes across these spatial units. Our approach is designed to produce labor markets geographical boundaries which are comparable across space and time. It can be implemented efficiently and globally to develop policies targeted at addressing spatial labor mismatches."}}

It argues that judges, advocates, and legal scholars should understand parens patriae as a broad doctrine recognizing the coequal sovereignty of states, in relation to each other, as protectors of distinctively public, collectively held rights within their borders, rather than being confined to its best-known application as a doctrine giving states Article III standing to sue in federal courts. This Article proposes the following definition of parens patriae as it has been used by the Supreme Court in relation to constitutional federalism, divided into numbered elements for the purposes of explaining and substantiating this Article’s claims: A (1) state government, (2) acting through any of its three branches, performs a constitutionally significant role as parens patriae when it (3) asserts or defends its interest as a sovereign government co-equal to its sister states (4) in protecting its populace at large from harms that are widespread and not exclusively traceable to identifiable individuals who have capacity to vindicate their own interests (5) against private parties or sister states, but not against the federal government to protect the state’s populace from the operation of federal law. When read in this broader context, the Court’s parens patriae precedents offer an untapped source of guidance for understanding the role states play in shielding their residents from harm, including, but not exclusively, with respect to reproductive health and gender-affirming care.</p>"}}

Consistent with the trade literature, IPs reducing trade barriers are linked to medium term improvements in firm performance. Subsidies discriminating against foreign interests are linked to short term improvements in value added (VA), productivity and payroll, which fade or turn negative in the medium term. Export incentives are linked to short term declines in firm performance followed by medium term gains. These relationships are stronger for young and financially constrained firms compared to older and less financially constrained firms. Industry distortions also matter—IPs are linked to stronger improvements in VA, capital and payroll in the short term when distortions are high. Finally, we find cross-sectoral spillovers: protective IPs targeting upstream sectors are associated with improved outcomes in downstream firms, while those targeting downstream sectors correlate with weaker upstream performance. Cross-sectoral spillovers from trade liberalizing policies are consistently positive and larger in magnitude, regardless of value chain position."}}

Although we start from observations and basic questions as posed by Acemoglu and Robinson in their work on the \"narrow corridor\", our approach delivers a greater variety of dynamic behavior and additional insights into challenges for liberal democracy. We analyze the dynamics of an uncontrolled system, a system with one-sided control by the elite, and a game model with strategic interactions between the two groups using dynamic systems theory, bifurcation theory, optimal control theory, and dynamic game theory. A low prevalence of negative e ects between groups, a low inequality of initial endowments, and a low discount rate of future events are helpful for establishing a liberal democracy. Somewhat unexpectedly, the competitive dynamic game model seems to grant slightly better chances for democracy, thereby questioning the idea of Thomas Hobbes&apos; \"Leviathan\"."}}

Agent&apos;s decision to migrate considers income in their home country and expected income abroad given the realization of a migration sunk cost and taking into account the probabilities of border and inland enforcement actions that might lead to deportation in an infinite horizon context. The model produces a migration decision-rule and equilibrium unauthorized immigration flows consistent with push and pull factors of migration. Under sunk costs that are uniformly distributed the model yields an analytic solution. Empirical implications of this theory are studied with calibrated versions of the model for Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador for the decade of the 1990s. The quantitative exercises find support for the theory. For Mexico, stagnant unskilled wages after the peso crisis (as opposed to GDP per capita which recovered relatively quickly), combined with rising unskilled wages in the US and strong Mexican population growth explain almost 80% of the change in unauthorized immigrants during the decade."}}

Over the years1954-1974 the average annual growth rate was close to 7%, whereas from 1975 to 2022 the same growth rate fell to nearly 1%. This paper explains what went wrong. Using annual data from well-known international databases for the period 1995-2023, the estimated dynamic ARDL model shows in no uncertain terms that responsible for the downward trend of economic growth during the post-1974 period was the multitude of redistribution policies that were introduced for the \"expressed\" purpose of reducing inequality. These policies by themselves would have discouraged saving, shrunk investment, suppressed risk taking and entrepreneurship, and incentivized businesses and professionals to move abroad. This is exactly what happened. But while reducing inequality was the pretext for gaining the support of the people and maintaining political stability, the key objective of the political order under the 1975 Constitution was the expansion of the state, which, based on the general government expenditure grew from 24.1% of the GDP in 1974 to 52.3% in 2023. And this, because to achieve the intended huge redistribution, governments killed economic growth by increasing taxes incessantly on income and wealth, burdening the economy with heavy value-added taxes, and expanding employment in the public sector, seemingly in a redistributive fashion to keep unemployment from exploding. Hence, to bring back economic growth and at the same time right democracy, my recommendation is to go back to the provisions and institutional arrangements of the 1952 Constitution or, even better, adopt the new constitution that six eminent Greeks proposed recently."}}

This paper investigates the impacts of algorithmically induced information biases on belief updating as well as learning efficiency and polarization, compounded by intrinsic cognitive biases. Using a controlled laboratory experiment in which participants sequentially update their beliefs based on signals drawn from potentially biased sources, we document a persistent pattern of surprise-driven learning: contrary to the well-established confirmation bias, participants systematically overreact to signals that challenge their prior beliefs. When information originates from biased sources, both polarization and learning inefficiency increase. However, mere awareness of source bias is insufficient to mitigate these adverse effects. While awareness dampens the tendency to overreact to disconfirming information, it does not improve learning efficiency and even exacerbates polarization."}}

This study examines the dynamic relationship between financial innovation and economic development, motivated by ongoing theoretical and empirical debates regarding whether financial innovation serves as a driver of long-term economic growth. The primary objective is to assess the impact of financial innovation on real GDP per capita and growth volatility over both the short and long term, with particular emphasis on variations across countries at different stages of financial development and the influence of financial crises. Using panel data from 39 countries spanning the period 1972-2016, the study employs the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator to capture dynamic effects, both before and after financial crises. The empirical findings indicate that financial innovation contributes to long-term economic development; however, in highly developed financial systems, it also amplifies growth volatility, particularly in the period preceding financial crises. In economies with less developed financial systems, financial innovation stimulates economic expansion but simultaneously heightens volatility, both pre-and post-crisis. These findings underscore the need for policymakers to implement regulatory frameworks that balance the benefits of financial innovation with the risks of financial instability. Most importantly, the study highlights the role of financial innovation in advancing SDG 8 by demonstrating its potential to foster sustained economic growth when appropriately managed."}}

Fixed-effect climate econometric models are specified to estimate the marginal yield impacts of extreme temperatures over 2000–2020, and future losses are projected under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. Results show that wheat is most vulnerable to cold stress during transitional and reproductive stages, while maize is most affected during late development. Wheat suffers greater cumulative losses due to higher exposure and yield base. Between 2000 and 2020, extreme temperatures led to an estimated total loss of 1.02 million tons of grain. Future warming is projected to shift crop vulnerability from acute cold to chronic heat stress, with significant losses expected even under low-emission pathways.

Existing reinforcement learning approaches often suffer from limited training efficiency and poor scalability in complex multi-agent scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel adversarial training algorithm combining a Multi-Network Hierarchical Search (MNHS) architecture with Fixed-Depth Bunch Search (BS). MNHS adopts a layered policy framework, where the high-level network handles global coordination tasks such as target assignment, while the low-level network focuses on flight-level action execution. A dynamic reward adjustment mechanism is introduced to adapt agent behavior to changing battlefield conditions. To enhance policy evaluation, we design disjoint action groups and apply chained search for optimal action selection. The BS mechanism enhances tactical diversity by maintaining synchronized fixed-depth search chains for both sides and replacing the traditional UCT method with a temperature-scaled selection strategy and Dirichlet noise to encourage strategic exploration. Experimental results in a simulated air combat environment show that this method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of both average reward and win rate."}}

Because AI reviews are relatively inexpensive compared to manual assessments, referees would otherwise delegate fully, which undermines quality. The paper shows that moderate detection of manipulation can paradoxically improve welfare. With intermediate detection probabilities, only low-quality authors undertake manipulation, and detection becomes informative about quality, inducing referees to mix between manual and AI reviews. This partially separating equilibrium preserves the value of peer review when AI quality is intermediate. When detection is too low, all bad papers are manipulated and the market unravels; when detection is perfect, referees use only AI and acceptance collapses. Thus, some prompt injection must be tolerated to sustain the market: it disciplines referees and generates information. The results caution against zero-tolerance enforcement and highlight how prompt injection can, counterintuitively, play a welfare-enhancing role when AI reviews are easily produced."}}

Alternatively, competitive equilibrium from equal incomes scales combinatorially in the number of items, making implementation and preference elicitation difficult. This paper considers paired serial dictatorship: a novel mechanism where agents signal relative preferences that determine their priority in each market. Any deterministic allocation that arises in equilibrium is Pareto efficient and envy-free, highlighting how seemingly innocuous tie-breaking is the key barrier to optimality and fairness. When agents differ only in relative preferences, paired serial dictatorship ex-ante Pareto dominates running random serial dictatorship independently in each market.

Recent studies have modeled this problem as a distributed robust differential game (DRDG), focusing on the dynamic interactions among agents and external disturbances. However, the strong nonlinearities of the game model in complex obstacle environments pose significant challenges in achieving an accurate feedback Nash Equilibrium (NE), thereby compromising reliability in practical applications. To address this, we propose a novel reliable-optimal balanced distributed robust differential game (ROB-DRDG) approach, which generates $\\epsilon$-distributed robust Nash equilibrium ($\\epsilon$-DRNE) strategies. Specifically, the strategies are constructed using a terminal state observer with stability guarantees, relying solely on distributed information from neighboring agents and effectively overcoming the challenge of achieving an accurate NE. Moreover, the existence of the $\\epsilon$-DRNE is theoretically guaranteed. To further enhance the reliability of the strategies, an additional receding collision cost is incorporated into the $\\epsilon$-DRNE framework, allowing agents to compete within the game while simultaneously avoiding obstacles at each receding horizon. This ensures a balance of individual interests and maintains system stability. Simulation and experiment results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method."}}

While DTE provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically, precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity."}}

We construct a federalism model of heterogeneous vertical tax externalities and horizontal tax competition, with asymmetries in resource richness, and a polluting and immobile extracting sector. The model shows that a federal tax hike redistributes clean capital towards environmentally regulated resource rich economies, as they are able to better absorb this hike due to their (resource-driven) fiscal advantage, raising air pollution by complementing production in the immobile extractive sector. We test the model’s predictions using a panel of U.S. non-attainment counties, regulated under the 1970 Clean Air Act, over the period 1981-2007. Our identification strategy rests on geologically-based differences in natural endowments, and narrative-based measures of federal tax changes. We find that federal tax hikes increase air pollution in non-attainment counties within resource-rich states, although these fiscal policies are contractionary and environmental regulation is at place. Our results shed light on the externalities of natural resource abundance, and the efficacy of existing environmental regulation."}}

Measures of FDI based on financial transactions reveal evidence of ideological sorting and nearshoring. The capital expenditures of multinational enterprises and their affiliates display ideological sorting, derisking, nearshoring, and reshoring. Cross-border M&amp;A deals reflect patterns of derisking, while horizontal (but not vertical) M&amp;A exhibits broader ideological realignment.

Moreover, we reject the null that returns and surpluses are simultaneously unpredictable, both locally and globally.

The effect of the technology on the innovation process is a crucial open question. Some inventions, such as the light bulb, temporarily raise productivity growth as adoption spreads, but the effect fades when the market is saturated; that is, the level of output per hour is permanently higher but the growth rate is not. In contrast, two types of technologies stand out as having longer-lived effects on productivity growth. First, there are technologies known as general-purpose technologies (GPTs). GPTs (1) are widely adopted, (2) spur abundant knock-on innovations (new goods and services, process efficiencies, and business reorganization), and (3) show continual improvement, refreshing this innovation cycle; the electric dynamo is an example. Second, there are inventions of methods of invention (IMIs). IMIs increase the efficiency of the research and development process via improvements to observation, analysis, communication, or organization; the compound microscope is an example. We show that GenAI has the characteristics of both a GPT and an IMI—an encouraging sign that genAI will raise the level of productivity. Even so, genAI’s contribution to productivity growth will depend on the speed with which that level is attained and, historically, the process for integrating revolutionary technologies into the economy is a protracted one."}}

Using the universe of real estate transactions in Spain and difference-in differences as well as spatial techniques, we obtain three main findings. First, the number of real estate transactions above the threshold increased by 43% more for non-EU relative to EU investors after the introduction of the programme. Second, non-EU investors appear to pay a premium of 11,521 Euro around the threshold relative to EU and Spaniards, but no other premium appears to exist along other parts of the real estate price distribution. Finally, we find that the programme had spillover effects on the real estate market. The average increase in golden visa exposure increases overall real estate transaction prices on average by 0.19% after the introduction of the scheme.&nbsp;"}}

We develop a novel macroeconomic framework to quantify demand-side goods quality by disentangling it into four task-related dimensions: headquarters management (MGT), research and development (RD), marketing and after-sales services (MAR), and fabrication and assembly (FAB). Using the granular World Input-Output Data (WIOD) and Labor Occupations Data (LOD), our approach overcomes the limitations of conventional input-output analysis that assumes industry homogeneity across countries, and captures the composition of task activities embedded in goods. With this framework, we uncover heterogeneity in the structure of demand-side quality across countries and final-use categories. We identify mismatches between domestic supply capabilities and demand-side quality requirements at the economy-industry level. Through structural decomposition analysis (SDA), we further isolate the key drivers of quality changes—namely, shifts in supply-side task specialization and the demand-side reallocation of geographical sourcing. Our findings also reveal divergent quality upgrading paths across major economies. We argue that this approach provides a useful foundation for understanding how regional and sectoral demand-side quality evolves under global task trade, and offers policy-relevant insights into how economies can enhance the quality of goods they absorb."}}

How do such policies affect economic behavior within the household? We study an Italian policy that grants a generous tax credit to main earners if their spouses, officially labeled as “dependent spouses” by law, earn below a cutoff. Using administrative tax data, we find sharp bunching at this notch among second-earner women, but no comparable response among second-earner men. This asymmetry is not explained by gender differences in occupational sorting or financial incentives. Instead, it appears consistent with gender identity costs: the “dependent spouse” label aligns with traditional female roles, but conflicts with male identity norms. Women, particularly in more gender-conservative contexts, persistently reduce their income and forgo job opportunities to preserve policy eligibility. Our findings suggest that gender identity norms can act as optimization frictions that influence household behavior when interacting with gender-blind tax design."}}

Longstanding economic theory suggests that labor (and capital) migration will undermine these efforts, such that attempts at redistribution may be fully offset by wage capitalization. Empirical evidence is inconclusive, however, with estimates for U.S. states varying widely from complete capitalization (Feldstein and Wrobel, 1998) to negligible effects (Leigh, 2008). This paper revisits this issue by constructing a pseudo-panel from Current Population Survey (CPS) data spanning 1997 to 2015. This approach allows us to control for unobservable individual effects and secular wage trends. We construct a Net Average Tax Rate (NATR), which accounts for federal and state income taxes, FICA, property, and sales taxes, offering a broader scope than some prior studies. We then employ a Bartik instrument to control for endogeneity. We estimate that adjustments to gross (pre-tax) wages offset 85–100 percent of redistributive policies for men and 65–90 percent for women. To account for potential biases in our core estimates arising from correlated shocks or measurement error, we implement a Difference-in-Differences Instrumental Variables (DiD-IV) approach. Here, we identify substantial year-over-year tax-rate changes, which are used as instruments for the NATR.

Public education expenditure per school-age individual in Sub-Saharan Africa is about 3% of the level observed in Europe and North America in 2025 in PPP terms (versus 6% in 1980 and 4% in 1950). We also find a large impact of human capital expenditure on productivity growth over the 1800-2025 period, especially for public education and for poor countries. Estimated returns using our macro-historical database are around 10% or more, in line with micro studies. Finally, we present simulations based on alternative human capital expenditure trajectories over the 2025-2100 period. In particular, we analyze the conditions under which convergence in human capital expenditure could lead to global productivity convergence by 2100 (around 100€ per hour in all regions in our benchmark scenario)."}}

The permanent tax hike triggered an immediate surge of over 100% in reported dividend income and tax revenues. It did not generate a lasting shift in dividend flows. In contrast, the temporary relief of 2017 led to a sharp decline in dividend payments upon its expiration. Notably, firms increased earnings retention after the preferential rate ended, potentially anticipating similar future relief. We also find evidence of income shifting via wage-to-dividend conversions for tax planning. Finally, increased earnings retention after 2017 produced a 1-2 percentage point downward bias in the top 1% income share due to unreported dividend income."}}

Specifically, we examine behavior in an individual decision-making experiment simulating retirement, where the sole motive for saving is to insure against longevity risk and delaying Social Security claims beyond the FRA is always optimal. In a baseline treatment calibrated to current U.S. Social Security rules, we confirm the early claiming of benefits and slower-than-optimal asset decumulation phenomena. Replacing greater annuities with lump-sum incentives in two alternative treatments works to accelerate asset decumulation but not to delay claiming. These findings are robust across both a student sample and an older sample aged 45-55. We show that a behavioral model with random attention, misperceived continuation probabilities, and noisy signals can account for the observed patterns."}}

There is growing concern that this system could pose serious risks for the entire financial system, yet it has received no scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators, who have instead acted to foster it. Despite the massive size and importance of the retirement system, there is little understanding of how and why it has taken its current form. This article aims to understand the sources of the current retirement savings regime by analyzing for the first time the history of its development.

However, its trajectory is profoundly shaped by environmental, economic, and security requirements. A scientific gap occurs in how to plan energy system transition considering these multifaceted requirements, and in how to quantify their impacts on technology selection. This challenge becomes particularly acute under ambitious decarbonization targets, such as carbon neutrality. To address it, this study develops a hybrid planning framework that integrates an hourly smart energy system simulation tool and multi-objective optimization algorithms, comprehensively considering all energy sectors, key cross-sectoral measures and natural resource constraints. Utilizing China&apos;s energy system as a case study, the proposed framework systematically evaluates the feasibility of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and identifies the transition schemes under these multifaceted requirements. The results indicate that achieving carbon neutrality in China is feasible, with diverse technology combinations capable of meeting this goal. Compared with traditional scenario development, the optimal scheme determined by the framework achieves a reduction of 7.64 million tons of CO2 emissions alongside a 2.5% decrease in energy system cost, highlighting its ability to coordinate multiple objectives. Furthermore, this study reveals that technology development trends in the low-carbon transition depend on the prioritization of different objectives. In summary, the proposed planning framework can be applied to design low-carbon transition schemes for energy systems across diverse regions, providing deep insights into achieving ambitious decarbonization targets."}}

The first such subsidy was the American Apprenticeship Initiative (AAI), whose aim was to increase the number of Registered Apprentices in eligible states in advanced manufacturing, information, and healthcare industries. I analyse the AAI’s causal effect on the number of new Registered Apprentices using federal Department of Labor administrative data. I exploit state, time, and industry variation in AAI treatment eligibility to conduct difference-in-difference and triple-difference estimation. I additionally leverage spatial variation to perform spatial regression discontinuity and spatial difference-in-discontinuity regressions. Results indicate that the AAI has not led to growth in the number of new Registered Apprentices. I discuss potential statistical and economic reasons behind this result and offer policy implications."}}

Motivated by recent energy price volatility and investment uncertainty, we investigate whether Italy’s policy shift can achieve key objectives: supporting decarbonisation, enhancing energy security and ensuring affordability. We employ the NET model — a system-dynamics framework calibrated on national data and policy targets — extended to incorporate CfD auctions, the MACSE storage-procurement mechanism, capacity-remuneration tools and Terna’s planned grid upgrades. Using 12-year Monte Carlo simulations (2024–2035), we compare outcomes in terms of renewable energy deployment, system-cost efficiency and consumer-price dynamics, and test robustness via sensitivity analyses. Our results demonstrate that renewables reduce consumer bills and narrow future price volatility, yet neither CfD nor SMP alone meets the National Energy and Climate Plan’s 2030 decarbonisation target — a shortfall driven by low ceiling prices in CfD auctions and moderate fossil-fuel price forecasts under SMP. While electricity price differences between the two market designs remain modest, beyond a certain RES penetration threshold, CfD is more effective at containing price spikes, whereas SMP facilitates faster long-term price declines via accelerated RES investment. These findings imply that policymakers should periodically recalibrate CfD auction parameters — particularly ceiling prices — to maintain alignment with evolving market conditions. Conversely, relying solely on merchant initiatives risks subjecting policy targets to uncontrolled fossil-fuel price fluctuations."}}

A novel two-layer collaborative architecture is proposed, comprising a &apos;non-cooperative game (dynamic power trading among microgrids)&apos; and a &apos;master-slave game (ESO–microgrid aggregation)&apos; framework. The lower layer employs real-time electricity prices to guide distributed autonomous decision-making within microgrids while ensuring data privacy. The upper layer, managed by the ESO, establishes dynamic charging and discharging price incentive strategies to enable global coordination. To manage the uncertainty of wind and solar power, a distributed robust chance-constrained (DRCC) model based on the Wasserstein distance is developed, optimizing the worst-case probability distribution within a data-driven ambiguity set. This model effectively balances economic efficiency and robustness by overcoming the limitations of stochastic optimization (SO), which ignores distributional bias, and robust optimization (RO), which tends to be overly conservative. An ADMM-based alternating iterative algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the two-layer optimization model. Simulation results indicate that, compared to independent operation, the proposed strategy enhances system efficiency by 1.5%–4.26%; the inclusion of ESO further reduces total costs by 5,689.14 yuan. Compared to SO and RO, the DRO approach achieves an optimal trade-off between conservatism and economic performance, providing a robust solution for the coordinated scheduling of high-renewable-penetration microgrids and shared energy storage."}}

The methodology involves four main components: (1) mathematical modeling of H2-RES components with an enhanced demand response model for improved load flexibility; (2) formulation of the scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP); (3) integration of entropy regularization and nonlinear convergence factors in IPPO-clip to balance exploration and exploitation; (4) conversion of optimization objectives into reward-penalty functions for continuous state-action space decision-making. Case studies demonstrate the method&apos;s effectiveness in resolving supply-demand conflicts and improving load factors.

However, can the pressure on net interest margins (NIMs), induced by structural financial frictions, cause a reversal-rate-like effect to emerge prematurely even under a conventional monetary policy framework? In the context of China&apos;s tiered banking industry structure, small and medium-sized commercial banks (SMEs) face intense deposit competition, making them an ideal sample for this study. Using data from 183 SMEs from 2009 to 2023, we construct exogenous monetary policy shocks via a high-frequency identification method and employ multiple econometric methods to test our hypotheses. The study finds that an expansionary monetary policy shock causes a significant short-term decline in NIMs, prompting a defensive business restructuring. This restructuring manifests as a \"loan-to-securities\" asset shift and a pivot toward non-interest income, with the response being particularly pronounced for high-NIM banks. This asymmetric response results in an initial contraction in credit supply, where the bank risk-taking channel temporarily overpowers the credit channel. Our central contribution is to uncover the mechanism through which structural banking frictions alter the dynamic path of monetary policy transmission. We demonstrate that \"cost rigidity\" on the liability side can lead to an initial reversal of policy effects, creating a novel and challenging policy trade-off for central banks in economies with less developed financial systems. These findings show that the \"reversal rate\" is not just a ZLB-specific issue but a broader phenomenon rooted in market structure, with significant implications for financial stability and macroeconomic management."}}

The proposed framework integrates both economic and environmental concerns across the entire value chain, including virgin spodumene extraction, concentration, chemical conversion to Li2CO3 and LiOH, and distribution stages. A detailed appraisal of water requirements is conducted for each process, such as spodumene concentration and lithium compounds production, joined by the absolute material impact indicator (DMA) from a circular economy perspective. Furthermore, an innovative metric is proposed to account for greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2, enabling a broader, comprehensive environmental evaluation of the supply chain. To ensure precision and robustness in the results, a Mixed-Integer Non Linear Programming model is proposed, incorporating multiple levels of stakeholder interests. Then, the approach is applied to the case study of Brazil. Therefore, an accurate strategy for the national development of its lithium industry, as well as key challenges that must be addressed, is argued. Results showed that spodumene concentration is the most water-intensive stage, accounting for 83% of total consumption. In addition, from both economic and environmental perspectives, LiOH production in Brazil is more sustainable, supporting a strategic and progressive change from Li2CO3. Accordingly, this study contributes to enhancing widespread electromobility in Brazil by aligning the lithium supply chain with global sustainability goals and resource efficiency principles."}}

We offer a novel contribution by combining immersive driving simulator data with stated choices to test spillover effects on preferences for travel time and carbon emissions. Our design captures how real-time, experience-based feedback, augmented by personalised driving advice, influences behaviour. We find evidence of behavioural shifts, and a link between those shifts in preferences and behaviour in the simulator. Crucially, we reveal substantial heterogeneity in responses, underscoring the need to move beyond homogeneous assumptions. The willingness to accept longer journeys in return for reduced CO2 emissions increases from 22.6 mins per kg to 39.87 mins per kg after seeing the driving advice information. The findings have implications for designing policies that harness spillover mechanisms to reduce transport-related emissions, making a valuable contribution to environmental research and transport policy."}}

In our contribution to the consultation, we want to highlight four aspects that based on our research would be important for any future activity of the European Union (EU) with regards to data. </span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>First, we want to stress that the approximation of laws should not compromise fundamental rights like privacy and data protection. While simplification of laws can reduce burdens for businesses, doing so without caution risks undermining essential fundamental rights protections, especially those enshrined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Given the private sector's growing power and the persistent gaps in safeguarding rights amid technological advances, any regulatory reform should prioritise the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. A balanced, research-informed approach is necessary to ensure that competitiveness does not come at the expense of ethical and legal safeguards. </span></p>\n<p><span>Second, data sharing requires particular care with the quality of the shared information. The legal basis for the European Commission's Communication itself is Article 114 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Although the Communication states that a range of initiatives with different legal bases is expected, the legal basis in which the European Commission decided to ground the call for Evidence raises concerns. Data governance instruments require tailor-made solutions. However, if the focus remains legal instruments, the European Commission risks to overlook the potential of non-legal instruments to govern data sharing with the detail required by the high level of protection conferred to personal data in the EU. Also, further research is required to clarify the p</span><span>urposes and effects of data spaces, data hubs and AI regulatory sandboxes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Third, non-commercial purposes of data processing, such as research, public interest, societal and democratic participation, should be explicitly addressed in the Data Union Strategy Communication. Unlocking the full potential of data depends on exploring and investing in discussions and solutions around non-commercial (re-)uses of data. Research should occupy a leading role in the Data Union Strategy, allowing the development of fundamental concepts and recommendations for data governance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, the Data Union Strategy should reflect on recent lessons from regulating data intermediaries under the Data Governance Act (DGA). Current definitions lack clarity, fragment governance, and can discourage responsible data sharing. We encourage the European Commission to support research into how these organisations and data governance frameworks function in practice, whether they build trust, interoperability, and public value, and whether regulation is proportionate for an emerging market. Issues such as the uncertain status of Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) underscore the need for better alignment between copyright law and broader frameworks regulating intermediation services, such as the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The Strategy should seize this opportunity to address these challenges, enhance legislative coherence, and ensure that future interventions are integrated, proportionate, and grounded in robust research - laying the foundation for more coherent and effective data governance.</span></p>\n<p><span>These four points are further developed in the position statement attached to our contribution, where we also develop twelve concrete recommendations on how to tackle each area.<b></b></span></p>"}}

The following questions are addressed: a) Was this change in residential valuations temporary, or is it likely to be permanent? b) For what other characteristics do we see a fundamental shift in valuation by home buyers? c) Did seven other cities follow a consistent change with Greater London? Using transactions data for more than 1.5 million house sales from 2017 to 2023, and detailed neighborhood information, we find a persistent flattening of the CBD-distance price gradient: by 7.7% (from -0.683 to -0.63) in Greater London and 9.6% (from -0.135 to -0.122) in major UK cities. An event study confirms the change is stable over time. Hedonic price models show that this effect holds after controlling for amenities, with post-pandemic buyers placing greater emphasis on school quality and property type. Notably, demand shifts toward large homes, with premiums rising for terraced, detached, and semi-detached houses, and falling for apartments (flats). Effects of crime and density vary by region, showing stronger negative valuation in London and weaker or even positive effects elsewhere."}}

While access to safe water is internationally recognised as a human right, contemporary water crises are deeply embedded in a political economy shaped by capitalist growth. Water injustices are not just technical or legal issues, but structural outcomes of an economic model that prioritises accumulation and profit. Despite its normative achievements, the right to water has often been operationalised within this very framework-focussing narrowly on minimum access to water, while remaining compatible with privatised, corporatised and commodified water regimes. Against this backdrop, this chapter argues for a radical reconceptualization of the right to water. Drawing on ecosocialist and degrowth scholarship, it situates water (in)justices within this broader landscape of capitalism, calling for a shift in how we frame, think and struggle for a HRtW. In doing so, the chapter acknowledges the limits and contradictions of rights discourse, while insisting that rights can still be mobilised strategically-as part of a broader counter-hegemonic project-to challenge systemic injustices and construct alternative post-growth futures."}}

Online instruction also reduces women’s longer-run performance and increases their study dropout.

It explains why certain economic activities are more efficiently conducted within particular social contexts, highlighting the non-market factors that influence economic efficiency. Lower transaction costs, facilitated by robust social capital, can lead to enhanced market efficiency, improved firm performance, and accelerated regional economic development. However, it is also crucial to acknowledge that social capital is not uniformly beneficial; its effects can vary depending on its type (e.g., bonding versus bridging) and can, in some instances, lead to exclusion or inhibit innovation. Nevertheless, incorporating social capital provides a richer, more behaviorally informed perspective on how economic actors navigate the complexities of exchange.</p>"}}

Using direct and indirect standardization techniques, we measure horizontal inequity (unequal care among areas with similar need) and vertical inequity (differential care in response to differing needs). Applying this framework to traffic-related air pollution policies in Italian municipalities from 2012 to 2021, we find that the observed reduction of overall inequality in environmental care is mostly driven by a decline in horizontal inequity. However, we find evidence of persistent socioeconomic disparities, with lower-income municipalities receiving disproportionately less policy effort relative to their environmental needs."}}

Moreover, the concurrent election increases participation by candidates with nationally-established parties, while decreases participation with independent parties. This further translates into a higher votes share for nationally-established parties and a consequent higher probability of election. Elected mayors tend to have lower education and experience in office, while they are more likely to be from the municipality they were elected in. Further, elected mayors are able to attract more intergovernmental transfers, without substantially affecting local spending patterns."}}

Effectively addressing this phenomenon requires a thorough understanding of its causes. This article focuses on identifying long-term factors influencing unemployment in the Visegrad Group (V4) countries in the period from January 2005 to December 2022.Purpose of the article: The aim of the study is to analyze seasonal fluctuations in unemployment in the V4 countries, identify relevant macroeconomic determinants of long-term unemployment, quantify their impact, and at the same time point out differences between the individual countries of this group.Methods: To identify seasonality, autocorrelation analyses of unemployment time series were applied. Subsequently, seasonal decomposition was used to quantify deviations from the trend. Long-term determinants of unemployment were identified using SARIMA modeling. More than 20 macroeconomic variables were evaluated – for example, interest rates, minimum wage, GDP, inflation, exports, foreign direct investment, corruption rate, tax burden and social benefits. The quality of the models was verified using graphical analysis of predictions, autocorrelation of residuals and indicators such as MAPE and BIC.Findings & value added: The results confirm the presence of seasonal fluctuations in the unemployment rate, while their intensity and periodicity differed between countries. The most pronounced seasonality was recorded in Poland, the weakest in Slovakia. The most significant long-term factors affecting unemployment included state spending on the labor market, social benefits, inflation, interest rates, tax revenues, business confidence, corruption rate and foreign investment inflow. The impact of these factors varied by country, direction of effect and time lag."}}

This paper examines the formation and dissolution of global strategic alliances in the container shipping industry, with a particular focus on the 2M Alliance between Maersk and MSC. Using empirical data and a multi-market Cournot oligopoly model with capacity constraints, we analyze the incentives behind alliance formation, the efficiency gains from vessel reallocation, and the impact on market competition and consumer welfare. The findings reveal that vessel reallocation plays a crucial role in enhancing supply-side efficiency, but the extent of these gains depends on the comparative advantage of alliance members and aggregate market conditions. Counterfactual simulations demonstrate that alliances can increase efficiency and consumer welfare when members have distinct fleet compositions, but they may also enhance market power under certain conditions. The study concludes with policy implications regarding the regulation and long-term viability of global strategic alliances in the shipping industry."}}

We find that initiating such plans significantly increases the reliance of affected firms on bank debt relative to public debt. This effect is more pronounced among firms prone to suffer from climate risks, with more fragile fundamentals and higher information asymmetries. Furthermore, we find that the spreads of newly issued bank loans rather than corporate bonds decrease significantly after the finalization of CLAPs. Our overall findings indicate that relative to public debtholders who are lacking of capacities to acquire firm-specific information, banks are able to distinguish climate-resilient borrowers, which shed light on how debt instruments should be designed to better adapt to climate change."}}

While patent filings have increased significantly, trade secrecy remains important due to the tacit, context-specific nature of key processes and the constraints of exportcontrol regimes. At the same time, openness is a scientific and often strategic lever, enabling interoperability, cumulative research, and ecosystem formation through mechanisms such as open-source frameworks and cloud-access platforms which can lead to competitive advantage through network effects. Using a governance-stack heuristic that links legal instruments to specific technical layers-from hardware and control systems to software and interfaces-the chapter maps how exclusivity, confidentiality, and collaboration are configured in practice. This layered combination, involving the superposition and entanglement of IP and open innovation, shows that QIT competitive strategy depends not on choosing between proprietary and open models, but on calibrating their combination to fit technical, commercial, and policy objectives. The chapter reframes the prevailing debate in quantum innovation: rather than asking whether patents or secrecy are appropriate for quantum technologies, the key question becomes when, where, and in what form each instrument best serves both private incentives and public goals."}}

To capture spatiotemporal variations in salinization, we develop a localized index based on river salinity measurements and unique geodata on the extensive regional canal network. Our findings show that salinization significantly reduces rice yields while generates disproportionately large decreases in agricultural revenues. To explain this difference, we document a sizable contraction of land under rice cultivation, with only minimal shifts toward alternative uses such as salt-resistant crops. This suggests a lock-in effect in rice farming and highlights limited short-term agricultural adaptation potential. Our results from household and firm data further indicate farmers' lower probability of working own-farm jobs and simultaneously friction in their reallocation to local, nonagricultural sectors. However, we observe long-term intergenerational adjustments, as farmer households increase relative investments in their children's education. We interpret this result to be a strategic response by households to an anticipated high-salinity future, where urban, high-skilled employment becomes more attractive."}}

Drawing on the theory of behavioral finance, we examine how sentiment-driven factors-such as emotions, cognitive biases, and social influences-shape investor decision-making in these volatile markets. By analyzing both theoretical perspectives and real-world market data, we highlight how investor sentiment can lead to market inefficiencies, increased volatility, and sudden shifts in asset prices. The paper also delves into the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance sentiment analysis, offering a more accurate and timely understanding of market dynamics. Through AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, investors can better gauge sentiment trends and predict market movements, providing a competitive edge in emerging economies. The case studies of India and Argentine illustrate the complex interplay between sentiment and market behavior in environments characterized by political instability, economic uncertainty, and external shocks. Finally, the paper discusses the possibility of building an Investor Sentiment Index for India and Argentine Sovereign Bonds, and the implications for investors and policymakers in managing sentiment-induced volatility, as areas for future research in the integration of AI and behavioral finance in emerging markets."}}

Participants were introduced to the rules of two public goods games, one of which includes a cooperation-inducing mechanism, while the other does not.

I find that increasing R&amp;D subsidies increases knowledge accumulation and clean-sector output, displacing dirty-sector production. This raises overall output, lowers production costs, and enhances sectoral competitiveness. However, environmental benefits from R&amp;D subsidies occur only under an emission tax or in the absence of environmental policy. Under an emission cap, emission prices fall from an increase in the R&amp;D subsidy, reducing compliance costs without lowering total emissions. Our calibration further reveals interaction effects between environmental policy stringency and the effectiveness of the R&amp;D subsidy under an emission tax, emission cap, or in the absence of an environmental policy."}}

Gold miners provide leveraged exposure to gold and additional exposure to equity and mining-related risks. On average, miners underperform, especially over long horizons, during crises and in gold bear markets, with only marginal underperformance in gold bull markets. The underperformance is due to finite mine lives which implies that miners must continually replace the gold that they mine with new reserves to match the returns of physical gold. While a selection of gold mining firms outperform gold bullion, a portfolio of gold miner shares diversifies away the idiosyncratic upside of individual miners and is a less attractive investment compared to a direct holding in gold bullion."}}

Although these two forces often shift demand in the same direction, they arise from different mechanisms and carry distinct policy implications. Our flexible framework allows for the separate identification of these relationships using either order-level or consumer-level data. Building on Gentzkow (2007), we leverage variation from product entry and bundle choices to disentangle the underlying sources of demand correlation. We show that standard discrete choice models confound complementarity and variety effects, resulting in biased parameter estimates. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy and robustness of our identification strategy. To illustrate the policy relevance of our model, we simulate a cross-market merger between complements. Our results demonstrate how demand correlation, particularly a strong variety effect, shapes post-merger incentives for bundling and non-interoperability."}}

To maintain the United States' leadership in science and medicine, a decisive and well-funded national strategy is imperative. This paper outlines a strategic framework designed to place the NIH at the core of an AI-native biomedical ecosystem. We propose a vision where autonomous agents drastically shorten discovery timelines and make personalized medicine a widespread reality. Our strategy emphasizes a dual approach: pursuing high-risk, high-reward basic science while simultaneously building a rigorous framework for the clinical translation of AI technologies. We present a phased roadmap that progresses from current semi-autonomous agents to fully autonomous laboratory platforms. This evolution is supported by foundational investments in a national AI research infrastructure, workforce development, and a steadfast commitment to developing ethical, equitable, and trustworthy AI. This document details the strategic necessity for this transformation and provides a comprehensive plan for the NIH to execute this ambitious vision."}}

We evaluate four dropout strategies (fixed, Monte Carlo, dynamic, and adaptive), each paired with fourteen divergence-based penalties. The models are assessed using expanding-window cross-validation and detailed hyperparameter tuning. Results show that all regularized models outperformed the unregularized baseline.

However, geotechnical designers encounter considerable uncertainty in designing DDM columns, arising from the properties of both soil and binder, as well as the stabilization techniques employed. These uncertainties are exacerbated when using novel binders, whose behaviour in real field conditions is still under investigation. In such cases, probabilistic simulation provides a systematic approach to quantifying and managing these uncertainties. This paper presents a reliability-based design framework that combines finite element (FE) analysis using the volume average technique and Monte Carlo simulation. The framework accounts for the uncertainty in the calculation of residual settlements of both soil and stabilised soil parameters in the case of a testing embankment built on low-carbon end-bearing and floating stabilised soil columns. The VAT approach was validated using field measurements and was found to reasonably capture the behavior of length-varying columns. Probabilistic results showed a depth-dependent trade-off: shorter columns produced higher mean settlements as expected, but lower relative scatter. In contrast, longer columns can meet strict serviceability criteria at the expense of much greater relative variability. However, sensitivity analysis revealed that allocating resources for characterizing soil and column properties at shallow depths is crucial for reducing uncertainty. Lastly, failure probabilities were linked with binder carbon emissions, enabling sustainable design and reliability adjustments based on environmental and performance trades-offs."}}

This study explores the impact of the global supply chain pressure index (GSCPI) on various economic activities utilising the quantile-on-quantile kernel-based regularised least squares (QQKRLS) approach and wavelet quantile regression (WQR). Our findings show that GSCPI generally exerts a positive impact on agricultural, food, and precious metal prices, particularly when all indices are at high quantiles and in the short term. Conversely, at low and medium GSCPI quantiles, and in the medium to long term, GSCPI positively affects fuel energy prices. At high GSCPI quantiles and in the long term, GSCPI mostly boosts the consumer price indices of the U.S. and China, with a stronger positive impact on the U.S. than on China. Additionally, GSCPI almost always suppresses world industrial production and trade, becoming a stimulator only in extremely long term. Finally, in the short to medium term, GSCPI reduces trade policy uncertainty but heightens U.S.-China tensions."}}

Results reveal a stark concentration of emissions: the top 1% of households account for nearly a quarter of total emissions, while the bottom 10% are responsible for just 0.1%. Carbon emissions are more unequally distributed than household expenditure, underscoring the environmental implications of income inequality. We also estimate the income elasticity of emissions, finding that a 1% increase in income leads to a 0.6–0.85% increase in emissions. These findings highlight the need to integrate distributional concerns into climate policy. Without addressing the carbon consequences of income growth, developing countries risk locking themselves into unsustainable and inequitable development trajectories."}}

We characterize equilibrium allocations and the platform's optimal fees, identifying distortions in app entry and consumer participation driven by a key ratio of app revenue to consumer surplus. Commission caps increase developer surplus and entry but may reduce consumer welfare, especially under two-sided heterogeneity. Allowing third-party payments replicates the effects of a cap under homogeneous app quality. When the platform self-preferences by introducing its own apps, it lowers commissions but raises device prices, reducing consumer participation while benefiting remaining developers.

Classical multiple testing procedures, such as the Bonferroni correction, control the family-wise error rate (FWER) but tend to be overly conservative, reducing statistical power. Stepwise alternatives like the Holm and Hochberg procedures offer improved power while maintaining error control under certain dependence structures. However, these standard approaches typically ignore hierarchical relationships among hypotheses-structures that are common in settings such as clinical trials and program evaluations, where outcomes are often logically or causally linked. Hierarchical multiple testing procedures-including fixed sequence, fallback, and gatekeeping methods-explicitly incorporate these relationships, providing more powerful and interpretable frameworks for inference. This paper reviews key hierarchical methods, compares their statistical properties and practical trade-offs, and discusses implications for applied empirical research."}}

While previous studies have broadly analyzed general correlations between financial resources and athletic success, this research narrows the scope to assess how specific factors-including but not limited to NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) funding, ticket revenue, return on investment, and revenue-relate to team winning percentages. The research question is: What are the winning percentages of college basketball teams in the Big East Conference, in relation to their economics (tax dollars paid, tuition, or revenue made from sports events)? This topic is especially relevant as NIL policies and changing revenue structures are reshaping college athletics. To answer this question, a correlational research design and quantitative method were used to conduct the research by gathering economic data and analyzing the relationship between financial investment and winning percentages. The findings suggest that while general financial investment does not guarantee higher winning percentages, targeted spending-particularly in areas like NIL deals and athletic-specific contributions-has a stronger correlation with success. These results are important because they can help athletic directors, administrators, and policymakers optimize both team success and economic gain by understanding the key factors that contribute to performance."}}

This paper has two main contributions. First we propose an enhanced composite indicator, the Systemic Vulnerabilities Index (SVI), which captures the buildup of systemic vulnerabilities. The index is built on an innovative approach that uses optimal aggregation of subindices, and without imposing exogenous constraints. Specifically, making use of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for a broad set of relevant input variables, we determine their relative importance in contributing to the buildup of systemic vulnerabilities. Subsequent use of Monte Carlo simulation techniques allows us to select the optimal SVI that best predicts future credit losses. The proposed SVI captures both time and sectoral dimensions of the buildup of risks. We provide evidence showing a superior performance of the SVI, compared to the traditional credit-to-GDP gap in documenting risk accumulation. We investigate the relationship between our SVI and financial condition index and provide evidence of a negative correlation between the two, whereby a loosening of financial conditions is associated with more accumulation of imbalances. Second, we provide a framework that guides on how the SVI can be used for increasing Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) beyond its neutral level. Specifically, we propose a mapping that shows how the SVI can help determine the timing of setting a CCyB beyond the neutral rate as well as its magnitude."}}

Leveraging a high-frequency oil supply shock series and a rich panel of quarterly labor market data, we find that shocks raising oil prices trigger sharp and persistent employment losses, particularly in oil-importing countries, oil-intensive sectors, and among male workers. Delayed but enduring employment declines also emerge in oil-moderate sectors and among female workers, revealing broader labor market implications. In contrast, employment gains in oil-exporting countries, and following expansionary supply shocks, are comparatively modest. Labor force participation responds less consistently, with patterns displaying higher variability. These findings highlight how oil shocks transmit unevenly through labor markets, with lasting impacts across countries, sectors, and demographic groups, extending well beyond short-term macroeconomic fluctuations."}}

Impacted countries may respond in (at least) three ways: imposing retaliatory tariffs on the US, resorting to industrial policy to support their producers, and/or signing trade agreements to find new market access opportunities. Relying on a quantitative trade model, we study the trade and welfare implications of these policy responses. Retaliation hurts US exports, can improve the terms of trade, but also creates distortions. Subsidies can expand exports, making up for lost markets in the US, but they are costly, increase distortions especially for the subsidizers, and worsen trade diversion effects that could eventually lead to new tariffs targeting subsidizers. Seeking deeper integration with other partners can help countries expand trade while reducing distortions. Even in presence of US tariffs, real income for the liberalizing countries and the world is higher when partners choose to deepen integration as part of their policy strategy."}}
