In Hurstwood Properties v Rossendale BC, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom had occasion to review an application to strike out claims for the recovery of business rates by local authorities. The registered owners of non-domestic properties had engaged in two business rates avoidance schemes and argued that as a result, the local authorities had no reasonable grounds for bringing the claims.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n The Court thus had to decide whether there were reasonable grounds for arguing that the three doctrines could be applicable in the case before it and proceeded to consider them seriatim in that specific order. The case is a notable one, being a rare situation where the Ramsay principle was pleaded alongside an attempt to pierce the corporate veil. It expressly affirms the applicability of the Ramsay principle outside of the strict confines of revenue law, though this note will analyse whether the Court actually applied the Ramsay principle, or a form of purposive interpretation. The case also uses the language of forward and reverse piercing of the corporate veil, expressly recognising what was only briefly alluded to by Baroness Hale in Prest v Petrodel, and noting that there appears to be very little room for the former to operate.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u82f1\u56fd\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u5728Hurstwood Properties v Rossendale BC\u6848\u4e2d\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e86\u5730\u65b9\u5f53\u5c40\u8ffd\u8ba8\u5546\u4e1a\u7a0e\u6b3e\u7684\u7533\u8bf7\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u865a\u5047\u4ea4\u6613\u3001Ramsay\u539f\u5219\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u9762\u7eb1\u523a\u7834\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6cd5\u9662\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86Ramsay\u539f\u5219\u5728\u7a0e\u6536\u6cd5\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u9762\u7eb1\u523a\u7834\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "research_question": "\u6cd5\u9662\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u7528\u865a\u5047\u4ea4\u6613\u3001Ramsay\u539f\u5219\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u9762\u7eb1\u523a\u7834\u8fd9\u4e09\u79cd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u539f\u5219\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5730\u65b9\u5f53\u5c40\u8ffd\u8ba8\u5546\u4e1a\u7a0e\u6b3e\u7684\u7533\u8bf7\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8be5\u6848\u6d89\u53ca\u5546\u4e1a\u7a0e\u6b3e\u907f\u7a0e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6cd5\u9662\u9700\u660e\u786e\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\u7a0e\u6536\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u865a\u5047\u4ea4\u6613\u539f\u5219\u3001Ramsay\u539f\u5219\uff08\u7a0e\u6536\u53cd\u907f\u7a0e\u539f\u5219\uff09\u3001\u516c\u53f8\u9762\u7eb1\u523a\u7834\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6cd5\u9662\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6848\u4ef6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8fdb\u884c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "findings": "\u6cd5\u9662\u786e\u8ba4Ramsay\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a0e\u6536\u6cd5\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u516c\u53f8\u9762\u7eb1\u523a\u7834\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6b63\u5411\u523a\u7834\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Ramsay\u539f\u5219\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u9762\u7eb1\u523a\u7834\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u907f\u7a0e\u6848\u4ef6\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u88c1\u51b3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u7a0e\u6536\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u529b\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The title of this thesis may be broken down into four components: 1) beneficial ownership; 2) attribution; 3) res; and 4) UK tax law. This thesis will therefore explore what beneficial ownership is, how it performs its main function of attributing a res to a person, what a res is and what other rights may be attributed, and how the above applies within the confines of UK tax law. This thesis briefly discusses related (but distinct) concepts of beneficial ownership in other areas of tax law but focuses on the concept as it applies in the context of what it refers to as \u2018UK domestic tax law\u2019. Beneficial ownership is part of a group of related concepts (referred to collectively in this thesis as \u2018combined subdivision variants\u2019) which largely serve a similar purpose and are often interchangeably used. More broadly, beneficial ownership is one of several methods of attribution used in UK tax law to connect a res (or, more broadly, an asset) to a person for various tax purposes. This thesis considers the distinctiveness of the beneficial ownership concept and how it fits within this broad taxonomy of methods of attribution. Four main research questions have been framed and answered by this thesis: 1) why is it important to attribute assets (and res) to persons under UK tax law; 2) what are the methods of attribution (especially beneficial ownership) and how are they used in UK tax law; 3) how can the methods of attribution be used in legislative drafting to achieve tax policy goals; and 4) how might a framework for using methods of attribution to achieve drafting goals be developed?"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u82f1\u56fd\u7a0e\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u2018\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u4ea7\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6743\u5229\u53ca\u5728\u7a0e\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "1) \u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u7a0e\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5c06\u8d44\u4ea7\uff08\u53cares\uff09\u5f52\u5c5e\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4eba\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\uff1f2) \u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff09\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u7a0e\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\uff1f3) \u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7acb\u6cd5\u8349\u6848\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a0e\u6536\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\uff1f4) \u5982\u4f55\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8349\u6848\u76ee\u6807\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u7a0e\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7acb\u6cd5\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u4ea7\u5f52\u5c5e\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u2018\u7ec4\u5408\u7ec6\u5206\u53d8\u4f53\u2019\u5171\u540c\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u76ee\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u82f1\u56fd\u56fd\u5185\u7a0e\u6cd5\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u7acb\u6cd5\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "findings": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7a0e\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5728\u7a0e\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7acb\u6cd5\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a0e\u6536\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This article spotlights the unexamined issue of digital currency regulation by examining the practice and related regulatory rules of the pilot CBDC in China. Beginning with the global design choices of digital currencies, the article comparatively examines the technical design of China's CBDC, known as e-CNY. It further triggers a rethinking of conventional regulations for the protection of digital currency information by investigating the gap between the actual operation and design of e-CNY, as well as the gap between pilot policies and legal provisions such as the Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law, and the Personal Information Protection Law. This article argues that, on the one hand, the legislative balance between the protection of personal information and the regulation of illicit financial activities involved in the \"loosely coupled account link\" system of e-CNY should be reconsidered. On the other hand, the delineation of rights and responsibilities between dissemination institutions, payment service providers, and end-users needs to be further redefined and clarified."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65b0\u51a0\u75ab\u60c5\u4e0b\u5168\u7403\u4ea4\u6613\u6a21\u5f0f\u5411\u6570\u5b57\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e2d\u56fd\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\uff08e-CNY\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u56fd\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\uff08e-CNY\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u4ea4\u6613\u6a21\u5f0f\u5411\u6570\u5b57\u652f\u4ed8\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ca\u5404\u56fd\u5bf9\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u6cd5\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56fde-CNY\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bd5\u70b9\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "findings": "e-CNY\u7684\u201c\u677e\u8026\u5408\u8d26\u6237\u94fe\u63a5\u201d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7acb\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6743\u8d23\u5212\u5206\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u660e\u786e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Most studies of collisions with barrier terminals were done more than twenty years ago. The safety performance evaluation of in-service barrier terminals is overdue given the considerable evolution of vehicles design and introduction of modified types of barriers terminals. Thus, this study evaluated the safety performance of alternative barrier terminals under the current traffic and vehicles in traffic. This study was meant to help Indiana safety engineers identify the effective barrier terminal under certain local conditions.Eight years of crash records in Indiana were linked to the corresponding barrier terminals in Indiana Road Network Dataset. Potential safety factors, such as road functional class, speed limit, presence of close intersections or ramps, vehicle types, operating speed, road surface and weather conditions were collected. Safety performance of a barrier terminal was viewed in this study as its capability of reducing crash severity. It was done under the premise that the probability of hitting a barrier terminal at a certain location was independent of the barrier end type thanks to their comparable exposition to traffic. A random parameter ordered logit model was estimated to associate crash severity levels with barrier terminals and other safety factors. The Monte Carlo simulation was then used to estimate the severity outcomes of the studied alternative barrier terminals. This performance was expressed with the severity outcome distribution and with the expected average cost of a collision outcome. The results indicate that SKT barrier terminal perform consistently well, followed by ETPlus, and CAT."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4ea4\u901a\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66ff\u4ee3\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SKT\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662fETPlus\u548cCAT\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u4ea4\u901a\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u540e\u679c\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u62a4\u680f\u9762\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u6709\u5e8fLogit\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u7eb3\u5dde\u516b\u5e74\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "findings": "SKT\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662fETPlus\u548cCAT\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u7eb3\u5dde\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u6548\u62a4\u680f\u7ec8\u7aef\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

First, for all four groups of laws, the perceived morality influenced compliance consistently and more strongly than the perceived legitimacy of the authorities and all other motivations. The influence of perceived legitimacy of authorities was inconsistent across the four groups of laws tested. Second, the influence of perceived severity of punishment was consistent and significant across all four groups of laws, whereas perceived risk of apprehension had no significant impact on compliance. Third, evaluations of procedural fairness, not those concerning the equitable distribution of law enforcement services and effectiveness of law enforcement, were most strongly linked to legitimacy. In addition to showing that China is a law-abiding society governed by morality, these results underscore the importance of examining morality and magnitude of punishment as potential motivations for compliance in addition to legitimacy and certainty of punishment. They also illustrate the necessity to examine different groups of laws separately when studying compliance. Finally, these results challenge the linkage between legitimacy and compliance previously established in the literature. Public Significance Statement This study of Shanghai residents underscores the importance of normative motivations in compliance with law. Perceived morality is found to influence compliance consistently and more strongly than all other motivations. In addition, the study identifies procedural fairness as the primary antecedent of legitimacy. These findings show that focusing on moral inculcation and enforcing the law fairly are more important than expending more public resources on enforcement in obtaining compliance with the law and maintaining social order."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff1a\u65e5\u5e38\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u9075\u5b88\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u5a01\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u6d771000\u540d\u53f8\u673a\u7684\u95ee\u5377\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9053\u5fb7\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9075\u5b88\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7a0b\u5e8f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cd5\u6cbb\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e5\u5e38\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u9075\u5b88\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u5a01\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9075\u5b88\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eTyler\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u5411\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u9053\u5fb7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u673a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ebf\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e51000\u540d\u4e0a\u6d77\u53f8\u673a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "1. \u9053\u5fb7\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9075\u5b88\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5f3a\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b2. \u60e9\u7f5a\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7ec4\u522b\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3. \u7a0b\u5e8f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9075\u5b88\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u5e9c\u6ce8\u91cd\u9053\u5fb7\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6267\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0\u6267\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

While many studies have examined their safety effectiveness, few have explored alternative configurations (size, placement and profile) under varying road and traffic conditions. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis using a large dataset of Indiana rural two-lane roads, incorporating crash data, rumble strip configurations, traffic volumes, and road geometry. A total of 13,258 lane departure crashes from 2015 to 2022 were mapped to 4,516 segments along 571 road sections. To address crash count overdispersion due to unobserved heterogeneity among sections and across years, nested random effect negative binomial models were estimated separately for property-damage-only (PDO) crashes and fatal-or-injury (FI) crashes. Results confirmed the safety benefits of rumble strips with significant differences by placement and profile.

While many studies have examined their safety effectiveness, few have explored alternative configurations (size, placement and profile) under varying road and traffic conditions. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis using a large dataset of Indiana rural two-lane roads, incorporating crash data, rumble strip configurations, traffic volumes, and road geometry. A total of 13,258 lane departure crashes from 2015 to 2022 were mapped to 4,516 segments along 571 road sections. To address crash count overdispersion due to unobserved heterogeneity among sections and across years, nested random effect negative binomial models were estimated separately for property-damage-only (PDO) crashes and fatal-or-injury (FI) crashes. Results confirmed the safety benefits of rumble strips with significant differences by placement and profile. Conventional rumble strips outperformed sinusoidal ones, and combining centerline and side rumble strips offer better performance. Side rumble strips were particularly effective in reducing FI crashes on roads with narrow shoulders, while centerline-only rumble strips were less effective on curved segments.

However, it remains unclear in which scenarios drivers tend to execute lane changes and how the lane changing vehicle and the surrounding vehicles jointly complete the entire lane-changing process in these scenarios. This research establishes a two-level integrated clustering framework tailored to the specifics of LC interactions. At the upper level, the normalized k-means algorithm and pairwise aggregation SSE (sum of the squared errors) are jointly used in this research to handle high-dimensional data and analyze the scenarios in which drivers tend to execute lane changes (i.e., LC initial-scenario). At the lower level, the interaction feature extraction method is utilized to explore the LC interaction patterns corresponding to different LC initial-scenarios. Based on the highD trajectory data and the aforementioned two-level integrated clustering framework, this research identifies 9 major LC initial scenarios and 20 major LC interaction patterns of human drivers, and establishes the relationships between different LC initial scenarios and LC interaction patterns.

The study moves beyond the limitations of traditional survey methods and simplistic computational analyses by employing a sophisticated, data-driven methodology to analyze discussions pertaining to the Top 50 Global Retailers. The analytical framework integrates two advanced techniques: BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling algorithm, for the semantic discovery of latent thematic categories, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa model (cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest), for nuanced, context-aware sentiment classification. The analysis reveals three dominant, empirically-derived thematic categories in customer discourse: Physical, Cognitive, and Social. Principal findings indicate that Physical factors, encompassing e-commerce usability, delivery logistics, and the in-store environment, are the most frequently discussed dimensions of the retail experience, comprising 39.5% of the discourse. Conversely, Social factors, related to customer service interactions, emerge as the most significant source of customer friction, exhibiting the highest proportion of negative sentiment at 43.55%. Cognitive factors, related to price and value, are associated with the most positive sentiment, with positive posts (20.37%) outnumbering negative ones (14.70%).

With thousands of public sector AI applications already in use worldwide, this new suite of digital tools offers the potential for better informed, more efficient, and fairer administration across a full range of governmental policies and programs. At the same time, governmental authorities\u2019 use of AI raises significant concerns about bias as well as threats to privacy, transparency, and accountability. In 2024, in response to these concerns, the European Union adopted the most comprehensive and potentially the most consequential law regulating both public and private sector AI use: the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. Unlike more fragmented and permissive regulatory approaches taken by other global powers, such as China and the United States, the EU\u2019s AI Act establishes a binding regulatory scheme that applies across the board to both public and private sector AI use. Perhaps nowhere are the stakes of the Act\u2019s regulatory policies likely to be more apparent than in the public sector, as the Act not only prohibits certain unacceptable AI uses by governments but also imposes requirements on the use of \u201chigh-risk\u201d systems\u2014a category that will likely encompass virtually all public sector AI applications that directly affect citizens\u2019 interests, including those used to evaluate eligibility for essential public services, assist law enforcement, and support adjudication. As the Act has begun to be implemented, however, European leaders are starting to react to global competitive pressures and express skepticism about excessive regulatory stringency imposed on AI firms. This tension between the EU AI Act\u2019s comprehensive AI governance scheme and intensifying market pressure facing Europe over AI reflects a deeper challenge facing societies all around the world: how to ensure the safe, fair, and accountable deployment of AI technologies, especially in the public sector, while also securing the benefits that these new technological innovations can provide the public. Navigating this challenge will be critical to ensuring responsible AI governance today and in the years to come. This essay serves as the foreword to the first major scholarly volume to focus comprehensively on the implications of the EU AI Act for public sector use of AI. <i>The EU Artificial Intelligence Act and the Public Sector</i>, edited by Juli Ponce and Agust\u00ed Cerrillo-i-Mart\u00ednez, could not come at a more crucial time, as the EU AI Act\u2019s comprehensive governance approach to promoting careful and accountable deployment of AI by governmental entities is being implemented against an ever-shifting geopolitical and economic landscape."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u300a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cd5\u6848\u300b\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5168\u7403AI\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5730\u4f4d\u53ca\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u76df\u300a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cd5\u6848\u300b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5168\u7403\u6cbb\u7406\u610f\u4e49\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8AI\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6b27\u76df\u7684\u300a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cd5\u6848\u300b\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u76d1\u7ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u76df\u300a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cd5\u6848\u300b\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u7403\u7ade\u4e89\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u6cd5\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u7981\u6b62\u67d0\u4e9bAI\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7cfb\u7edf\u65bd\u52a0\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u5e73\u8861\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5168\u7403\u7ade\u4e89\u538b\u529b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3aAI\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u65bdAI\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u8d23\u4efb\u3002"}}

However, STMM teams have the potential to cause harm due to unfamiliarity with the patient population, culture, and disease epidemiology. Specifically, mobile primary care clinics run by STMMs are run in-silos and are not linked with any existing electronic health records system, creating room for potential medical errors. To date, there have been limited attempts to tailor Electronic Health Records (EHR) to STMM mobile clinics and existing systems remain in early developmental stages.\u00a0Objective\u00a0\u00a0To develop an EHR system suited for STMMs that does not depend on internet connectivity, improves patient safety and patient care processes, and has longer-term sustainable applications.\u00a0Methods\u00a0Traditional STMM clinic processes are described, and historical post-trip feedback were retrieved. Brainstorming with stakeholders was conducted to determine the essential features of the EHR system.

While economic growth and tourism are recognized as drivers of public welfare, their combined impact on crime, conflict, unemployment, and population health remains underexplored. This study introduces a formal game-theoretic model, applied across 85 countries, integrating GDP per capita and tourism development as strategic levers that influence five interrelated public health and stability outcomes. Methods: We constructed a multi-actor game-theoretic model using a dataset from 85 countries, with GDP per capita and tourism flows as strategies. The outcome payoffs-crime rate, war intensity, unemployment, health security, and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE)-were modeled using linear partial-effect functions derived from global health and economic indicators. A utility-based Nash equilibrium was computed and interpreted, and findings were triangulated with literature and policy cases from diverse geopolitical contexts. Findings: The analysis reveals a dominant strategy in GDP investment and a best-response strategy in tourism development, converging at a Best Response Dominant Nash Equilibrium (BRDNE) at high levels of both GDP and tourism. This equilibrium yields the optimal utility-defined by minimized social instability and maximized health outcomes-across the 85-country sample. GDP was consistently associated with reductions in crime and conflict, while tourism enhanced health outcomes but introduced slight trade-offs in unemployment and conflict exposure. Interpretation: In the 85-country model, simultaneous optimization of GDP and tourism-when supported by labor and conflict mitigation policies-leads to the highest attainable joint benefit for public health and social stability. Gametheoretic approaches can inform multisectoral investment strategies, especially in fragile, post-conflict, or rapidly developing contexts.&nbsp;"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e86GDP\u548c\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8GDP\u548c\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "research_question": "GDP\u548c\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u72af\u7f6a\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u5931\u4e1a\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5065\u5eb7\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u65c5\u6e38\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u591a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e85\u56fd\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u6548\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "findings": "\u9ad8GDP\u548c\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\uff0cGDP\u51cf\u5c11\u72af\u7f6a\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u63d0\u5347\u5065\u5eb7\u4f46\u7565\u589e\u5931\u4e1a\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u591a\u90e8\u95e8\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8106\u5f31\u6216\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5730\u533a\u3002"}}

O ntologies, as the term is used in informatics, are structured vocabularies comprised of human-and computer-interpretable terms and relations that represent entities and relationships. Within informatics fields, ontologies play an important role in knowledge and data standardization, representation, integration, sharing and analysis. They have also become a foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) research. In what follows, we outline the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), which covers multiple areas in the domain of coronavirus diseases, including etiology, transmission, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. We emphasize CIDO development relevant to COVID-19. Human coronaviruses have given rise to a series of major crises in global public health. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in November 2002, lasted for eight months and resulted in 8,098 confirmed human cases in 29 countries with 774 deaths (case-fatality rate: 9.6%) 1. Approximately ten years later in June 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another highly pathogenic coronavirus disease, was identified in Saudi Arabia. The MERS outbreak has caused 2,260 cases in 27 countries and 803 deaths (35.5%) 2. More recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, when there were 118,326 confirmed cases and 4,292 deaths. As of May 13, there have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases and over 295,000 deaths globally. Unfortunately, we still do not have available effective drugs and vaccines against these highly pathological coronaviruses. Extensive studies have been conducted on coronaviruses, the results of many of which exist in publicly available data repositories such as GEO 3. Publications concerning COVID-19 have exploded in recent months, and new clinical trials have been and are being conducted to develop drugs and vaccines against COVID-19, 1,430 of which have been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov as of May 13, 2020. As of May 13, 2020, a PubMed search of \"SARS\", \"MERS\", and \"SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19\" resulted in 12,993, 4,493 and 11,813 publications, respectively. A coordinated study of all such results would likely help with understanding and developing treatments for COVID-19. This coordinated study requires the integration of the large and exponentially growing data and research concerning COVID-19 to better understand its etiology, transmission, and pathogenesis mechanism. Moreover, we must be able to translate that understanding into rapid development of patient stratification."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u300a\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\uff08CIDO\uff09\u300b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5b83\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u75c5\u56e0\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u3001\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u9632\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86CIDO\u5728COVID-19\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\uff08CIDO\uff09\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u6574\u5408\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5982COVID-19\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5f00\u53d1\uff1f", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\uff08\u5982SARS\u3001MERS\u548cCOVID-19\uff09\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u836f\u7269\u548c\u75ab\u82d7\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u79ef\u7d2f\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u6574\u5408\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002CIDO\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528CIDO\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u75c5\u56e0\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u3001\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u9632\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u3002", "findings": "CIDO\u4e3a\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fCOVID-19\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "CIDO\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6574\u5408\u5927\u91cfCOVID-19\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5bf9\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

This research paper explores the multifaceted impact of AI on job automation and its subsequent influence on the global workforce. While AI increases efficiency, accuracy, and productivity, it also raises concerns about job displacement, especially in sectors involving repetitive and routine tasks. However, rather than entirely eliminating jobs, AI is reshaping them-creating demand for new skill sets and emerging roles in areas like AI development, data analysis, and robotics maintenance. This paper analyzes current trends, case studies, and statistical data to understand how organizations are adapting to these changes, and how governments and educational institutions are addressing the evolving needs of the labor market. Furthermore, the paper examines ethical and social implications, such as income inequality, digital divide, and workforce reskilling.

To do this, reviews were processed to generate an approximate sentiment score using the TextBlob library, related to the user&apos;s rating. In turn, simple and multiple linear regressions, and regressions including interactions, were performed to predict price, as well as multiple linear regression models to predict rating using sentiment score, price, and Review Votes (support for other users&apos; reviews).Additionally, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network models and Transformer based models from the Hugging Face library were trained for both prediction tasks. The results show a moderate correlation between sentiment score and Rating (r\u22480.554) and a significantly higher fit for rating prediction with more complex models (R2\u22480.727) than with linear regression (R2\u22480.308). In contrast, all approaches were poor at attempting to predict price (R2\u22640.086), indicating the limited linear relationship between the available attributes \u2028and the product&apos;s price."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4e0a334,328\u6761\u5173\u4e8e\u89e3\u9501\u624b\u673a\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u63a2\u7d22\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u9501\u624b\u673a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e0e\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bc4\u5206\u53ca\u4ef7\u683c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TextBlob\u5e93\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u611f\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "findings": "\u60c5\u611f\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08r\u22480.554\uff09\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff08R2\u22480.727\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff08R2\u22640.086\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

Traditional, centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are becoming increasingly overburdened by the sheer volume, variety, and sophistication of emerging threats. In response, recent research has turned to the programmability of the data plane in network devices such as switches, edge gateways, and smart network interface cards, enabling intrusion detection to be performed closer to the traffic source or along the forwarding path. Programmable Data Planes (PDPs) support custom packet parsing, on-the-fly header manipulation, and the extraction of packetand flow-level features, making it possible to detect and mitigate attacks at early stages without relying entirely on centralized IDSs or firewalls. This survey provides a comprehensive review of techniques that leverage PDPs for network intrusion detection, encompassing methods ranging from simple thresholding, rule-based logic, and statistical analysis to more advanced strategies involving entropy-based metrics and AI-driven inference models. It also examines how researchers have tackled the inherent limitations of programmable hardware, such as constrained memory, fixed pipeline stages, and restricted programming constructs, all while striving to maintain high detection accuracy and low latency. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future directions essential for evolving PDP-based intrusion detection to meet the demands of increasingly complex and dynamic\u2028network environments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\uff08PDPs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u9608\u503c\u5230AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\uff08PDPs\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08IDSs\uff09\u56e0\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u8d1f\u62c5\u8fc7\u91cd\uff0cPDPs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d41\u91cf\u6e90\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u9608\u503c\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u548cAI\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cdPDPs\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "findings": "PDPs\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u514b\u670d\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86PDPs\u5728\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72PDPs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This growth in internet users has made many Africans vulnerable to privacy threats. To protect their citizens' personal data, about 38 out of 55 African countries have legislated data protection laws. While previous literature has provided valuable insights into African DPLs, most studies have focused on summarising the legal framework or comparing them to other legislations like the General Data Protection Regulation. Therefore, there is a significant gap in understanding African DPL enforcement mechanisms. Our study seeks to address this gap by identifying common, unique trends and practices in African DPL enforcement. To conduct this research, we used a rigorous qualitative evaluation method of thematic content analysis involving three independent researchers. The researchers examined data protection laws of 20 African countries, which are publicly available in English, regarding their enforcement mechanisms. Our analysis indicates that all 20 countries require a dedicated data protection authority to enforce DPLs, and the laws apply to private and public sectors. To deter privacy violations, we observed that 85 per cent of the countries prescribe administrative sanctions; all the countries have provisions for financial and criminal sanctions; we also observed that 65 per cent of the countries studied allow data subjects to seek private right of action. Furthermore, all 20 countries in our sample require data controllers to register or notify data protection authorities before data processing; 55 percent of the countries have extraterritorial reach provisions.

This article interrogates the theoretical and empirical foundations of soft power as a mechanism of global hegemony in a fragmented multipolar world. While Joseph Nye's original formulation cast soft power as the ability to attract rather than coerce, this paper argues that such attraction must be analyzed through the lens of legitimation and consent. By synthesizing neo-Gramscian conceptions of hegemony with constructivist perspectives on norm diffusion, the article re-theorizes soft power as a performative and contested strategy of governance that operates through the co-construction of legitimacy between sender and receiver. Methodologically, the study employs a qualitative comparative case analysis of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the European Union's normative foreign policy, examining how each actor projects influence through material, institutional, and ideational channels. Drawing on data from primary policy documents, strategic narratives, and regional responses in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, the article identifies variation in outcomes based on recipient agency, elite brokerage, and societal resonance. The findings reveal that soft power succeeds not through mere dissemination of values, but through their localization, legitimacy, and alignment with local needs. The article concludes by highlighting implications for global governance and proposes a reformulation of soft power as a hegemonic technology of consent. It offers directions for future research on digital soft power, AI diplomacy, and post-Western norm entrepreneurship."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u4e86\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u548c\u5171\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u2018\u4e00\u5e26\u4e00\u8def\u2019\u5021\u8bae\u548c\u6b27\u76df\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u5916\u4ea4\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u548c\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6781\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u7403\u9738\u6743\u673a\u5236\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fd\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u519b\u4e8b\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff09\u6b63\u5728\u88ab\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u845b\u5170\u897f\u9738\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5efa\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8868\u6f14\u6027\u548c\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u56fd\u2018\u4e00\u5e26\u4e00\u8def\u2019\u5021\u8bae\u548c\u6b27\u76df\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u5916\u4ea4\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u5c04\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "findings": "\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5316\u3001\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5951\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u548c\u5171\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9738\u6743\u6280\u672f\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b57\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\u3001AI\u5916\u4ea4\u7b49\uff09\u3002"}}

Drawing from quantum cognition, bounded rationality, and institutional economics, the model treats choice as a probabilistic, observer-dependent process shaped by both internal conviction and external institutional pressures. Unlike classical models that assume linear rationality and fixed costs, QTC frames decision-making as a dynamic superposition of behavioral states, where agents \"collapse\" into action based on cognitive, procedural, and normative constraints. Using a quantum-inspired simulation, the study demonstrates that even agents with strong internal motivation may fail to adopt sustainable behavior when behavioral barriers are high-unless a form of \"quantum tunneling\" occurs. The model integrates methods such as Discrete Structural Analysis, Cognitive-Institutional Analysis, and Transactional Entropy Mapping to measure the psycho-informational costs of decision-making.

Unlike traditional approaches, our method can be applied to both public and private firms, enabling an analysis of how financial structure and managerial incentives influence pricing decisions. We find that financial structure matters: public firms systematically increase markups following an IPO. Moreover, during the 2021-2022 inflation surge, publicly listed firms expanded their margins by capitalizing on inflationary pressures-especially among firms with high retail ownership, large early-pandemic stock declines, and strong equity-based pay incentives."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6ea2\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u4f1a\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4ef7\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6ea2\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4ef7\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u975e\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6ea2\u4ef7\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5171\u540c\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u5c06\u6ea2\u4ef7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "findings": "\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u5728IPO\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ea2\u4ef7\uff1b\u57282021-2022\u5e74\u901a\u80c0\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u901a\u80c0\u538b\u529b\u6269\u5927\u5229\u6da6\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6ea2\u4ef7\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

To analyze this, we develop a model, where the principal introduces a subsidy program to prevent the agent from exiting and facilitate green investments, which would end the agent\u2019s reliance on the subsidy. We demonstrate that, while successfully mitigating deindustrialization, the subsidy can lead to unintended consequences. First, the principal\u2019s commitment problem can lower investment incentives and lead to the subsidy program being everlasting. Second, it can induce a \u201csubsidy trap\u201d, drawing non-targeted agents into the subsidy scheme. Lastly, it can reinforce the exit problem it intended to solve by encouraging opportunistic investments. When applying our results to the BEP, we conclude that the fiscal costs of this subsidy could, therefore, far exceed initial projections."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53bb\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8865\u8d34\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u201c\u6865\u6881\u7535\u4ef7\u201d\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8865\u8d34\u867d\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u53bb\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u627f\u8bfa\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8865\u8d34\u9677\u9631\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d22\u653f\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u8d85\u9884\u671f\u3002", "research_question": "\u8865\u8d34\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u6865\u6881\u7535\u4ef7\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53bb\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u80fd\u6e90\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\u5a01\u80c1\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u8d34\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u59d4\u6258-\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8865\u8d34\u5bf9\u9000\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8865\u8d34\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "findings": "\u8865\u8d34\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u627f\u8bfa\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8865\u8d34\u9677\u9631\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d22\u653f\u6210\u672c\u6216\u8fdc\u8d85\u9884\u671f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8865\u8d34\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8865\u8d34\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8b66\u793a\u548c\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of AI-powered forecasting models for retail operations, focusing on demand planning, customer behavior analysis, and supply chain optimization. Through the implementation of advanced predictive algorithms including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Random Forest, and XG Boost models, we demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. Our findings reveal that AI-driven approaches achieve 23% better accuracy in demand forecasting, 31% improvement in customer behavior prediction, and 28% enhancement in supply chain optimization compared to traditional methods.

Using a survey experiment on a representative sample of the Italian population, we randomly assign objective information about government debt to citizens, who become more sensitive to the risks of tax increases, spending cuts, and imbalances for future generations. We find no effect on the perception of debt reduction as an urgent policy priority. While remaining highly averse to any tax increase, treated respondents support spending cuts (but not in education and health care) as a policy to reduce the debt burden. We also show that subjects with distorted beliefs about government debt are no more responsive to the information treatment than subjects with correct beliefs, shedding light on the challenges of building a voting majority for debt-stabilizing policies."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u5927\u5229\u4eba\u53e3\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6837\u672c\u8c03\u67e5\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4eba\u5bf9\u51cf\u503a\u548c\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u9884\u4f7f\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u589e\u7a0e\u3001\u524a\u51cf\u5f00\u652f\u548c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u4ee3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u51cf\u503a\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4eba\u5bf9\u51cf\u503a\u548c\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u653f\u7b56\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u503a\u52a1\u7a33\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u516c\u4f17\u6001\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u610f\u5927\u5229\u4eba\u53e3\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6837\u672c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u67e5\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u5ba2\u89c2\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "findings": "\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u9884\u4f7f\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u589e\u7a0e\u548c\u524a\u51cf\u5f00\u652f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u51cf\u503a\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u652f\u6301\u524a\u51cf\u5f00\u652f\uff08\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u533b\u7597\u9664\u5916\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51cf\u503a\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u516c\u4f17\u503a\u52a1\u6001\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5728\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u503a\u52a1\u7a33\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5f00\u652f\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u3002"}}

An implicit assumption underlying this research is that firms own their IT infrastructure. Challenging this assumption, however, the emerging trend of cloud-sourcing suggests that IT may be owned by third-party vendors. Since third-party ownership of IT can introduce significant transaction costs and operational inefficiencies cloud-sourcing, unlike in-house enterprise IT, can be considered unlikely to drive M&amp;A growth. However, the unique combination of IT infrastructural and service flexibilities that cloud-sourcing provides could help in reducing the risk of integration failure posed by M&amp;As, thereby driving M&amp;A growth. Grounded in the transaction cost economics (TCE) and resource-based views (RBV) of the firm respectively, these arguments illustrate the conflicting theoretical viewpoints offered by prior literature. This study attempts to improve our theoretical understanding of the relationship between cloud-sourcing and M&amp;A growth by addressing the theoretical conflict.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Analyzing a dataset of cloud-sourcing deals and M&amp;As comprising 4,075 observations from 673 firms, our research finds cloud-sourcing to have a positive impact on the intensity and value of M&amp;As pursued. Consistent with our theoretical proposition that these positive effects arise from the reduced risk of M&amp;A integration failure afforded by cloud flexibilities, this research finds the effects to be driven by cloud services that are more standardized (i.e., Software-as-as-Service, public and globalized clouds) and adopted in informate rather than automate or transformate industries. Support for the theoretical proposition is further established through interviews with industry experts, and mechanism tests which reveal that cloud-sourcing particularly drives M&amp;As requiring intensive integration (i.e. operational versus financial M&amp;As) and is associated with reduced disclosure of M&amp;A risks in annual reports. Finally, consistent with our view that cloud souring smoothens post-M&amp;A integration, this research also finds firms with cloud-sourcing to have relatively stronger post-M&amp;A performance.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e91\u91c7\u8d2d\uff08cloud-sourcing\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u5e76\u8d2d\u6574\u5408\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e76\u8d2d\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea7\u751f\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e91\u91c7\u8d2d\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5e76\u8d2d\u589e\u957f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f01\u4e1a\u62e5\u6709IT\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u62e5\u6709IT\uff08\u5982\u4e91\u91c7\u8d2d\uff09\u5bf9\u5e76\u8d2d\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\uff08TCE\uff09\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u89c2\uff08RBV\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e864,075\u4e2a\u4e91\u91c7\u8d2d\u548c\u5e76\u8d2d\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u673a\u5236\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "findings": "\u4e91\u91c7\u8d2d\u5bf9\u5e76\u8d2d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e91\u91c7\u8d2d\u4e0e\u5e76\u8d2d\u589e\u957f\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e91\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u5e76\u8d2d\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Despite the recognized importance of these two strategic levers and the longstanding research interest in the topic, our understanding of the interplay between brand equity and vertical integration (company ownership of outlets) in a franchise system remains incomplete.&nbsp; \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n In this study, we revisit the five-decade-old question of how brand equity affects vertical integration in a franchise system and present some novel, nuanced insights into the topic. Evidence from a Bayesian Panel Vector Autoregressive model on a large panel data set shows that brand equity has a powerful, lagging inverse effect on vertical integration, such that higher brand equity leads to less downstream vertical integration in a franchise system. Reverse causality analyses identify a less pronounced but present reciprocal effect. Boundary conditions analyses reveal that the negative effect of brand equity on vertical integration is weaker in franchise systems with international presence and in retail-focused (vs. service-focused) franchises, and stronger in franchise systems with more financial resources.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n These findings (a) challenge traditional views (e.g., transaction cost theory, resource-based view, ownership redirection hypothesis) on the topic by demonstrating a negative effect for brand equity on vertical integration in franchise systems and showing that greater financial resources amplify this effect, and (b) shed new light on the intricate dynamics (temporal causation, reverse causation) and contingencies of this debated effect. Managerially, this research draws attention to the underrecognized strategic benefit of brand equity in mitigating channel governance issues and advise against unnecessary vertical integration, especially when brand equity is robust.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u54c1\u724c\u8d44\u4ea7\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u6574\u5408\u662f\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u8425\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6218\u7565\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9762\u677f\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54c1\u724c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u8d1f\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "research_question": "\u54c1\u724c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u8425\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u6574\u5408\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u54c1\u724c\u8d44\u4ea7\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u6574\u5408\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u8425\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u89c2\u3001\u6240\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9762\u677f\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "findings": "\u54c1\u724c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u6574\u5408\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u8d1f\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u8425\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u8d22\u52a1\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u54c1\u724c\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e0e\u5782\u76f4\u6574\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u54c1\u724c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u6e20\u9053\u6cbb\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u54c1\u724c\u8d44\u4ea7\u8f83\u5f3a\u65f6\u3002"}}

The paper argues for greater digital literacy, mental resilience, and systemic media accountability to curb the illusion of instant success."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Instagram Reels\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u77ed\u5185\u5bb9\u5851\u9020\u5370\u5ea6\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7684\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u68a6\u60f3\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u8d23\u4efb\u3002", "research_question": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\uff08\u5982Instagram Reels\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5370\u5ea6\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u6587\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u8350\u673a\u5236\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u77ed\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5851\u9020\u6587\u5316\u671f\u671b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum including letters he wrote as a child to his mother and notes to his best friend, this article examines how childhood trauma and various religious experiences influenced the intellectual and spiritual formation of John F. Kennedy. Although the lives of many presidents are well documented, insufficient attention has been paid to the role played by religious mentors who assisted future presidents to cope with trauma they endured as youth. Kennedy's perceptions of his childhood trauma and religious life provide an important lens for understanding his chronic illnesses leading to a life riddled with sickness, back pain, having one leg longer than the other, poor eyesight, and enduring invasive rectal exams. While suffering immensely, Kennedy exuded a calm and affable public persona. How did he survive these maladies that would have caused many others to succumb? This article also closely examines how Kennedy's religious views emerged during his teenage years as he was influenced by his mother, Rose, a devout Catholic. Kennedy's own words and the observations of those close to him provide insight about how his response to these varied afflictions helped him become a world leader who inspired hope."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7F\u00b7\u80af\u5c3c\u8fea\u7684\u7ae5\u5e74\u521b\u4f24\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u7ecf\u5386\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4ed6\u7684\u667a\u529b\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u5982\u4f55\u514b\u670d\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f4d\u4e16\u754c\u9886\u8896\u3002", "research_question": "\u7ae5\u5e74\u521b\u4f24\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u7ecf\u5386\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7F\u00b7\u80af\u5c3c\u8fea\u7684\u667a\u529b\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u514b\u670d\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u9886\u8896\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bb8\u591a\u603b\u7edf\u7684\u751f\u5e73\u88ab\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u4f46\u5b97\u6559\u5bfc\u5e08\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u672a\u6765\u603b\u7edf\u5e94\u5bf9\u7ae5\u5e74\u521b\u4f24\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u8db3\u591f\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u8bb0\u3001\u81ea\u4f20\u3001\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u80af\u5c3c\u8fea\u603b\u7edf\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u7684\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ae5\u5e74\u521b\u4f24\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u7ecf\u5386\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4eba\u6210\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u80af\u5c3c\u8fea\u7684\u7ae5\u5e74\u4fe1\u4ef6\u3001\u7b14\u8bb0\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eb2\u53cb\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u521b\u4f24\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u7ecf\u5386\u5bf9\u5176\u6210\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u80af\u5c3c\u8fea\u7684\u7ae5\u5e74\u521b\u4f24\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u7ecf\u5386\u5851\u9020\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u575a\u97e7\u6027\u683c\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u514b\u670d\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u9759\u53cb\u5584\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u5f62\u8c61\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5b97\u6559\u5bfc\u5e08\u5728\u603b\u7edf\u6210\u957f\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u80af\u5c3c\u8fea\u4e2a\u4eba\u6210\u957f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u9006\u5883\u4e2d\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u521b\u4f24\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

The region, home to nearly one-third of the world's child population, is characterized by stark socioeconomic inequalities, deeprooted cultural practices, fragile governance frameworks, and a chronic shortage of human and financial resources. These factors collectively undermine the effectiveness of CPS, exposing children to a high risk of violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of child protection mechanisms in eight South Asian countries-Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It explores how national frameworks perform in terms of preventing and responding to core child protection concerns: child labour, child marriage, trafficking, sexual abuse and exploitation, and violence in various forms. The analysis is grounded in international child rights standards, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and assesses how each country aligns with or diverges from these norms. Through a critical examination of legal instruments, institutional arrangements, frontline service delivery, workforce capacity, data systems, and community-based strategies, the study identifies both strengths and structural deficits. For instance, while some countries like Bhutan and the Maldives have made commendable progress in policy articulation and decentralization of child protection services, others like Afghanistan and parts of India still struggle with enforcement, coordination, and coverage-especially in fragile or conflict-affected settings. In recognizing the limitations of the regional context, the paper draws on child protection experiences and models from other world regions. It investigates integrated child welfare approaches from the Nordic countries, community-rooted mechanisms from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, and technological innovations in child data management from OECD nations. These comparative insights offer practical illustrations of how political will, legal reform, and institutional synergy can substantially transform child protection outcomes. Importantly, this paper advocates a paradigm shift in South Asia from reactive to preventive protection strategies. It underscores the need for child-centred, inclusive, and rights-based systems that engage families, schools, law enforcement, civil society, and children themselves as key stakeholders. It recommends building CPS that are not only legally robust and adequately resourced but also socially embedded and culturally responsive. The paper concludes with a set of forward-looking recommendations tailored for the South Asian context. These include legislative reforms, capacity building of child protection personnel, enhanced inter-agency coordination, increased public funding, and participatory monitoring mechanisms. Emphasis is also placed on the importance of collecting disaggregated child protection data, expanding access to justice for children, and designing programs that address the root causes of vulnerability such as poverty, gender inequality, and conflict. By blending regional analysis with global reflections, this paper contributes to a growing body of evidence advocating for holistic, scalable, and context-specific child protection reforms. The aim is to influence policymakers, practitioners, and development partners toward shared accountability in safeguarding the rights and dignity of every child in South Asia."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5357\u4e9a\u516b\u56fd\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u56fd\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u6838\u5fc3\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fd\u9645\u513f\u7ae5\u6743\u5229\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u4fdd\u62a4\u8f6c\u5411\u9884\u9632\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u5357\u4e9a\u516b\u56fd\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u6838\u5fc3\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5357\u4e9a\u5730\u533a\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u6587\u5316\u4e60\u4fd7\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u8106\u5f31\u53ca\u8d44\u6e90\u77ed\u7f3a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6539\u9769\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ee5\u300a\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u513f\u7ae5\u6743\u5229\u516c\u7ea6\u300b\uff08UNCRC\uff09\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u56fd\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u5b89\u6392\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u3001\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u793e\u533a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5404\u56fd\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "findings": "\u90e8\u5206\u56fd\u5bb6\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u4e39\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u4ee3\u592b\uff09\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u6743\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6\uff08\u5982\u963f\u5bcc\u6c57\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u90e8\u5206\u5730\u533a\uff09\u5728\u6267\u6cd5\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u4fdd\u62a4\u8f6c\u5411\u9884\u9632\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u513f\u7ae5\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u5229\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5357\u4e9a\u5730\u533a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7acb\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u8bbe\u3001\u673a\u6784\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u8d44\u91d1\u652f\u6301\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

MNOs seek access to the Upper 6 GHz band to provide a complementary capacity layer for their current 4G/5G access networks on top of their currently allocated bands on the lower and mid bands. The possibility of reaching a thriving use of the band depends on resolving a  regulatory conundrum: designing a suitable framework to allow MNOS and RLANs to share the band. <br><br>The European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) and the European National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs) face an enormous challenge when having to review numerous technical studies, which together not only offer a confusing view crowded with diverse technical options and sharing assumptions but also align themselves with one or another proposal. Assuming a market-oriented regulatory framework, a set of technical policy options that would allow the shared use of the U6 band by IMT and RLAN applications has been proposed by the Spectrum Usage Rights (eSUR) framework in [1]. Accordingly, an eSUR-type license should be either perpetual or very long duration; provide interference controls based on power (power flux density) limits for geographical and frequency boundaries and average received power level; be packaged by NRAs to a minimum viable size in both frequency and geographic to make them attractive as a long-term investment; and have no restrictions for trade or sub-lease. <br><br>This paper discusses recent European regulatory developments in trying to address this issue, by comparatively analysing the European studies mentioned above vis-a-vis a set of critical issues that focus on the potential for co-existence on the band. The latter would serve as an input to a European regulatory framework that this paper proposes to allow the shared use of the U6 band by IMT and RLAN applications under the market-oriented approach.

This argument is upheld from two perspectives. One, TESOL teachers need to develop their intercultural nonverbal communication competence while interacting with culturally diverse students. They have the responsibility to demonstrate leadership in intercultural sensitivity so that they teach with an intercultural education philosophy and intercultural attitude.

Each retailer's decisions on bag price and size are complicated by: (i) uncertainty in leftover amount while having to ensure a guaranteed minimum bag size, (ii) intricate relationships among contextual factors (e.g., customer quantity demand and unit penalty cost), and (iii) competing retailers' decisions. We develop a game-theoretic model to characterize a retailer's optimal strategies and examine how competition impacts these strategies and resulting outcomes. We show that, under certain conditions, the retailer should shift strategy focus between improving profit margin and reducing total penalties, highlighting the need to carefully balance retailer-, customer-, and platform-specific factors. Interestingly, compared with a no-competition benchmark, the price can be higher and the actual size can be larger under competition, and they can increase as competition intensity increases. More importantly, our analysis yields three key insights on the resulting outcomes. First, competition (versus the no-competition benchmark) can reduce food waste and enhance customer surplus without compromising the retailer's profit under practically relevant scenarios. Second, intense competition can significantly reduce both customer surplus and retailer's profit, and exacerbate food waste (e.g., when the original unit price of the leftover is high and retailers' expected leftover amount is small), suggesting that having more retailers may result in unintended consequences. Third, platforms can mitigate these consequences by leveraging the platform's discount rate, e.g., when retailers' leftover amount is small, a lower discount rate can reduce food waste."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u98df\u54c1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5305\u88c5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u98df\u54c1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u5305\u88c5\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5269\u4f59\u98df\u54c1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u5229\u6da6\u4e0e\u60e9\u7f5a\u6210\u672c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u53ca\u7ade\u4e89\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u7ade\u4e89\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u5305\u88c5\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u98df\u54c1\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u5ba2\u6237\u76c8\u4f59\u3002\u4f46\u6fc0\u70c8\u7ade\u4e89\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u8c03\u6574\u6298\u6263\u7387\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

In the context of Amazon.com, we identify 66 markets where Amazon introduced its Amazon brands and use a staggered Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SynthDID) model to estimate the effects on market price, engagement, and consumer perception. We find that entry of Amazon brands significantly reduces market price and price dispersion. For the competing products, the Amazon brand entry increases consumer engagement, measured by the number of product reviews, and improves product ratings. Yet, these competitive gains come at a perception cost: both perceived value and quality decline after the entry of Amazon brands. This suggests that while platform brands stimulate efficiency, they may simultaneously raise consumer expectations and undermine perceived product differentiation. To understand which products are most exposed to this shifting pressure, we implement a panel-adapted Double Machine Learning (DML) framework with multi-modal product embedding. We find that the third-party sellers, who offer moderately similar products to Amazon brand, face the most pronounced negative effects. Our findings generate valuable managerial and policy insights regarding digital platforms and third-party sellers on these platforms."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u81ea\u6709\u54c1\u724c\u8fdb\u5165\u5bf9\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7ade\u4e89\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a66\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u81ea\u6709\u54c1\u724c\u7684\u8fdb\u5165\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5176\u611f\u77e5\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u54c1\u8d28\u3002", "research_question": "\u5e73\u53f0\u81ea\u6709\u54c1\u724c\u7684\u8fdb\u5165\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7ade\u4e89\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u611f\u77e5\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e73\u53f0\u81ea\u6709\u54c1\u724c\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5356\u5bb6\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u53f0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u54c1\u724c\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u5408\u6210\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff08SynthDID\uff09\u548c\u9762\u677f\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u53cc\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08DML\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u81ea\u6709\u54c1\u724c\u8fdb\u5165\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5176\u611f\u77e5\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u54c1\u8d28\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u81ea\u6709\u54c1\u724c\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5e73\u53f0\u81ea\u6709\u54c1\u724c\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5356\u5bb6\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Workplace-based programs can increase moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) engagement while addressing barriers associated with inactivity.MethodsWe plan to conduct a clustered Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to determine the effectiveness of a workplace walking challenge intervention \u2013 50,000 for Life (50K4Life) \u2013 in improving brisk walking engagement (at least 7,000 steps/day, representing approximately 50,000 steps/week) for public school employees. The two-phase trial will include 30 public schools in two cohorts (15 per cohort) with predominantly Mexican American employees from El Paso County area schools in Texas on the U.S.-Mexico border. In Phase 1, the schools will be randomly assigned to 50K4Life or 50K4Life plus app-based push notifications. In Phase 2, schools with 50% or more participants accumulating 50,000 steps/week will continue receiving the same intervention. The remaining schools will be randomly assigned to receive individual or school-level intervention. As part of our intervention evaluation, we will conduct a process and cost-effectiveness evaluation to provide insight into cost and scalability.DiscussionThis study will provide evidence to support the implementation of walking challenge-based interventions that improve engagement among Mexican Americans living in the U.S.-Mexico border region."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u6b65\u884c\u6311\u6218\u5e72\u9884\uff0850K4Life\uff09\u5bf9\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u6539\u5584\u6548\u679c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u6b65\u884c\u6311\u6218\u5e72\u9884\uff0850K4Life\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u5728\u7f8e\u58a8\u8fb9\u5883\u5730\u533a\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd0\u52a8\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u75be\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u5065\u5eb7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8ba1\u5212\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u5065\u5eb7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5e72\u9884\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u96c6\u7fa4\u968f\u673a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08SMART\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3050K4Life\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6b65\u6570\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u63a8\u9001\u901a\u77e5\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u5065\u5eb7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7f8e\u58a8\u8fb9\u5883\u5730\u533a\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fc3\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Then, the court executed the award as decree, without any objection. In case of International commercial arbitration, party seeking the enforcement of the award should move to the Commercial Department of HC, as the assets or jurisdictional nexus of defendant. With the escalated internationalization, emergence of disputes in an International scale elevated which led to inception of Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Award, 1959 [\u201cNew York Convention\u201d]. The New York Convention steers an enforcement-oriented mindset&nbsp;for the Courts. The New York Convention permits enforcement of awards by the Court of the Contracting State through in-depth analysis of award not on legitimacy, but on the premise of integrity, rule of law, impartiality and in harmony with the Nation\u2019s policy.

While prior research has primarily focused on financial determinants of hedging decisions, we highlight the significant influence of operational metrics-particularly inventory levels and turnover rates-in shaping firms' engagement in derivatives markets. Drawing from a sample of 289 publicly listed chemical firms from 2016 to 2022, we employ probit regression and K-means clustering to explore how operational and financial factors jointly determine derivatives adoption. Our empirical results reveal that operational metrics have a non-negligible impact on hedging decisions. Specifically, inventory and turnover rates emerge as primary determinants of firms' initiatives, while pre-tax operating profit remains significant from a financial perspective. The moderation analysis of cash flow reveals that financially constrained firms prioritize derivatives for operational risk mitigation, while resource-abundant firms employ them selectively for strategic optimization. Furthermore, our robustness tests, which control for geographical distinctions and the COVID-19 effect, confirm that firm-specific operational characteristics consistently dominate firms' hedging decisions despite regional heterogeneity. Finally, clustering analysis underscores the interplay between operational efficiency and capital robustness, showing that firms exhibiting superior operational efficiency and capital robustness demonstrate higher engagement in derivatives hedging. These findings contribute to the corporate risk management literature by expounding on the primacy of operational considerations in derivatives usage, particularly in asset-intensive industries. The study also provides practical implications for manufacturing firms navigating volatile market conditions, emphasizing that integrating operational and financial strategies is crucial for effective risk management."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u5316\u5de5\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\u91d1\u878d\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd0\u8425\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5e93\u5b58\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5468\u8f6c\u7387\uff09\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u4f7f\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u5316\u5de5\u5236\u9020\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u7684\u91c7\u7528\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8d22\u52a1\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5957\u671f\u4fdd\u503c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8fd0\u8425\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528probit\u56de\u5f52\u548cK-means\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u4e3a2016-2022\u5e74289\u5bb6\u4e0a\u5e02\u5316\u5de5\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002", "findings": "\u8fd0\u8425\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5e93\u5b58\u548c\u5468\u8f6c\u7387\uff09\u5bf9\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u4f7f\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8d22\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd0\u8425\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fd0\u8425\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fd0\u8425\u4e0e\u8d22\u52a1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

The findings underscore the strategic importance of designing platform functionalities and category linkages that foster cross-participant interaction.

Using a large sample of U.S. corporate bonds from 2002 to 2022, we find that higher political risk significantly reduces bond liquidity. The effect is stronger for financially distressed firms, during periods of elevated economic policy uncertainty, and under weak consumer sentiment. It persists across credit ratings but is more pronounced for non-investment-grade bonds.

There is an ongoing debate about the existence and magnitude of economic benefits that would be realized if fiber was deployed to locations that are already served by high-speed broadband, but do not have fiber broadband.<br>Our study is the first to show that fiber deployment has significant incremental economic benefits even in the presence of other high-speed broadband technologies. The report also argues that because private actors will not capture all the benefits of fiber deployment the marketplace will not deploy enough fiber on its own. Based on these findings we suggest a few policy takeaways.<br><br>First, because the social return on investment is higher for fiber, directing more of the existing public funds towards fiber deployment will generate greater economic returns compared to investment in other high-speed broadband technologies such as hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC). Thus, the various public programs, such as the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, ReConnect, Capital Projects Fund and the federal Broadband Infrastructure Program (BIP), which are prioritizing fiber builds are on the right policy path. This prioritization needs to continue if the gains from deploying fiber are to be realized.<br><br>Second, based on available data, our research implies that even if fiber is deployed as an overbuild to existing high-speed technologies, the incremental benefits are sizeable. Thus, when the federal or local governments are measuring the underserved population, one important metric may be using a fiber-unserved metric and not just a speed-based metric. This will allow these entities to better target funding towards a fiber solution.<br><br>Third, federal and local governments that promote fiber deployment, such as BIP, Louisiana\u2019s Granting Unserved Municipalities Broadband Opportunities (GUMBO) program and Maine\u2019s ConnectMaine fund, should be encouraged and expanded. Additionally, the focus on fiber that some of these programs have, should be supported, and used as a model for other private-public initiatives.<br><br>Last, fiber is a future-proof solution and when the benefits and costs are evaluated on a long-run horizon, fiber becomes the optimal choice for delivering fixed high-speed broadband.<br><br>We find that deploying fiber to the 56 million households that are in tracts unserved by fiber, has the potential to generate at least $3.24 trillion in terms of net present value (NPV) in incremental economic impact.<br><br>Deploying fiber has the potential to increase housing values by $1.64 trillion (in NPV terms). It could increase average household values between 14% - 17% depending on non-urban versus urban areas. This translates to an average increase of $27,000 - $41,000 per house per year. The effect on housing values in non-urban areas is fives times greater than in urban areas and is driven by the greater number of unserved households in non-urban areas. For the 56 million unserved households, in net present value (NPV) terms, this implies a $1.4 trillion total increase in house values for non-urban areas and $242 billion total increase for urban areas.<br><br>Deploying fiber to all fiber-unserved locations can potentially lead to a one-time increase in income by $1.6 trillion (in NPV terms). The income effect comes from non-urban areas. U.S. households in non-urban areas with new access to fiber will likely experience an increase in their average income by $1,450 in one year. This translates to a total increase of $81 billion in one year.<br><br>Fiber deployment also has the potential to create at least 380,000 new jobs for the U.S. economy.<br><br>Fiber deployment also has a significant impact on remote work, environmental benefits, and is best equipped to handle the increased connectivity needs in a 5G world and beyond. In addition, it improves educational outcomes, reduces health costs (thereby increasing health savings), and accelerates technology adoption.<br>.<br>Additionally, a significant advantage of fiber is that it is a future-proof technology due to its ability to provide the critical broadband infrastructure required to deliver high speeds, scalability, reliability, and support for emerging applications and technologies. An optimal lower cost data network today will likely not meet the needs of tomorrow. Consequently, the least costly way of providing a given level of service today may create greater upgrade costs in the future. Fiber has the potential to handle all future capacity needs.

Does PE investment hurt or improve healthcare value, and if so, can its effect be mitigated through the use of health information technologies (IT)? Given the significant investments by PE firms in the healthcare sector in recent years, these are important research questions. Stakeholders, including policy makers, care providers, and patients, need to understand their likely impact and whether PE ownership is aligned with their interests. Drawing on resource-based view of the firm and stakeholder theory, we posit that PE investment can both positively and negatively influence healthcare value. More importantly, we argue that IT-enabled health information sharing can help align the interests of PE firms and hospitals with respect to the dual objectives of value-based care-cost reduction and care quality improvement. Using a staggered difference-indifferences approach and data from US hospitals from 2008-2020, we estimate changes in healthcare value following changes in ownership based on PE investment. In general, we observe that the overall value of healthcare delivered by hospitals declines after PE investment. However, our empirical evidence reveals that IT-enabled, health information sharing plays an important moderating role. Hospitals with stronger information-sharing capabilities exhibit greater cost efficiencies and improvements in care quality, leading to higher healthcare value after PE investment. In other words, health information sharing between providers mitigates the potential negative impact of hospital PE ownership on care value. Furthermore, we find that the type of health information sharing matters. Specifically, we observe that improvements in care quality are primarily driven by information sharing between hospitals and ambulatory care providers, instead of simply hospital-to-hospital sharing of patient health data. Our research also identifies the underlying mechanisms through which health information sharing improves care value by reducing hospitalacquired infections and readmission rates, thereby improving care quality, and enhancing labor productivity by reducing operating costs. Our results highlight the critical role of policies and common data standards needed to promote IT-enabled information sharing between healthcare providers, which, in turn, can align incentives of PE firms with the goals of value-based care."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\uff08PE\uff09\u6295\u8d44\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\uff08IT\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5176\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cPE\u6295\u8d44\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46IT\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u6295\u8d44\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u533b\u7597\u4ef7\u503c\uff1f\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5176\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0cPE\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u533b\u7597\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5229\u76ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u89c2\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u67902008-2020\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u533b\u9662\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "PE\u6295\u8d44\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46IT\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u62a4\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86IT\u5728\u8c03\u548cPE\u6295\u8d44\u4e0e\u533b\u7597\u4ef7\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u4fc3\u8fdb\u533b\u7597\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Using theoretical modeling and laboratory experiments, we show that proportional transfers, modeled as interest on Dollar balances, increase Dollar trade shares (Dollar dominance) and reduce Dollar velocities, thereby weakening the pass-through of monetary policy to prices. These dynamics are self-fulfilling: low inflation expectations drive trade shifts and slower spending, which in turn suppress Dollar prices. In the lab, we observe how evolving expectations shape trade, velocity, and inflation. Dollar policy induces inflation spillovers into Bitcoin by crowding out trade, despite Bitcoin's lack of a monetary authority, revealing the limits of central bank influence in an increasingly pluralistic monetary system."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7f8e\u5143\uff08\u4e2d\u592e\u94f6\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\uff09\u4e0e\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\uff08\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f9b\u5e94\u8d27\u5e01\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8f6c\u79fb\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u4e3a\u7f8e\u5143\u4f59\u989d\u5229\u606f\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7f8e\u5143\u4ea4\u6613\u4efd\u989d\uff08\u7f8e\u5143\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff09\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7f8e\u5143\u6d41\u901a\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u4f20\u5bfc\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u81ea\u6211\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff1a\u4f4e\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u4ea4\u6613\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u652f\u51fa\u653e\u7f13\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6291\u5236\u7f8e\u5143\u4ef7\u683c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u9884\u671f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea4\u6613\u3001\u6d41\u901a\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u80c0\u3002\u7f8e\u5143\u653f\u7b56\u901a\u8fc7\u6324\u51fa\u4ea4\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u80c0\u6ea2\u51fa\u5230\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e2d\u592e\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u65e5\u76ca\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u592e\u94f6\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\uff08\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f9b\u5e94\u8d27\u5e01\uff08\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u4f20\u5bfc\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7b49\u66ff\u4ee3\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u592e\u94f6\u884c\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u591a\u5143\u5316\u8d27\u5e01\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d27\u5e01\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8f6c\u79fb\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u4e3a\u7f8e\u5143\u4f59\u989d\u5229\u606f\uff09\u5bf9\u7f8e\u5143\u4ea4\u6613\u4efd\u989d\u548c\u6d41\u901a\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8f6c\u79fb\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f8e\u5143\u4ea4\u6613\u4efd\u989d\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6d41\u901a\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u4f20\u5bfc\uff1b\u4f4e\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u4ea4\u6613\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u652f\u51fa\u653e\u7f13\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u7f8e\u5143\u4ef7\u683c\uff1b\u7f8e\u5143\u653f\u7b56\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u80c0\u6ea2\u51fa\u5230\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u7ade\u4e89\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u4f20\u5bfc\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u6211\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u671f\u5728\u4ef7\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e2d\u592e\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u591a\u5143\u5316\u8d27\u5e01\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5236\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Household consumption patterns are more likely driven by the influence of societal comparisons, leading to conspicuous consumption. We propose that the relative social class of households within local reference groups impact their conspicuous consumption. We examine household spending on conspicuous goods to check how the consumption of conspicuous goods by upper-class households, defined by caste, religion, and income categories, affects the consumption of lower-class households in the same neighbourhood. The study also examines whether conspicuous consumption leads to household deprivation regarding beneficial consumption. We found a positive and statistically significant impact of the dominant reference group's conspicuous consumption on individual households' conspicuous consumption. We also found a positive correlation between household conspicuous spending and relative deprivation in essential consumption categories. These results indicate the strong influence of social factors driven by social comparison and peer influence in determining the consumption pattern of Indian households."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u540c\u4faa\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u5c42\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u540c\u793e\u533a\u4e0b\u5c42\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bb6\u5ead\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u6d88\u8d39\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5265\u593a\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e0a\u5c42\u5bb6\u5ead\uff08\u6309\u79cd\u59d3\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u548c\u6536\u5165\u5212\u5206\uff09\u7684\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u540c\u793e\u533a\u4e0b\u5c42\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\uff1f\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bb6\u5ead\u5728\u6709\u76ca\u6d88\u8d39\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5265\u593a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6d88\u8d39\u662f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u89c4\u8303\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4eba\u6d88\u8d39\u4e60\u60ef\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u540c\u4faa\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5bb6\u5ead\u5728\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u5546\u54c1\u4e0a\u7684\u652f\u51fa\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e0a\u5c42\u5bb6\u5ead\u5bf9\u4e0b\u5c42\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u4e0e\u57fa\u672c\u6d88\u8d39\u5265\u593a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u4e0a\u5c42\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u5bf9\u4e0b\u5c42\u5bb6\u5ead\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u70ab\u8000\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u4e0e\u57fa\u672c\u6d88\u8d39\u5265\u593a\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u540c\u4faa\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51cf\u5c11\u6d88\u8d39\u5265\u593a\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

This study investigates the determinants of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) among smallholder rice farmers using data from a cross-sectional survey of 1,577 respondents across major rice-producing states. A log-linear Cobb-Douglas production function was estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to identify the contributions of key input and socio-demographic variables to TFP. Key findings reveal that increased use of labor, fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, improved seeds, and ploughing significantly enhances productivity-labor alone increases TFP by 11.6%, and pesticides by 17.7%. Conversely, being female, having a larger household, and attaining higher formal education levels are associated with lower TFP. Farming experience (20.7% increase) and participation in government support programs (36.9% increase) positively affect productivity.

We show that incentives for regulated agents who hold market power are contingent on the key policy design choice of the market observable used to condition supply adjustments. Specifically, we develop a stylized dynamic model of a permit market with endogenous supply adjustments and increasing stringency over time, where a subset of agents holds market power. This allows us to draw distinctions between the two main approaches implemented in permit markets today, i.e., quantity-and price-based adjustment mechanisms. Quantity-based adjustments tend to exacerbate potential price distortions from market power. In contrast, price-based adjustments can mitigate them if implemented correctly while remaining active at later market stages. As market power concerns may become increasingly salient as permit market sizes decrease in line with net-zero targets, our results inform the ongoing debate about the design of supply adjustment mechanisms."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bb8\u53ef\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5185\u751f\u4f9b\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4ef7\u683c\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u5b9e\u65bd\u65f6\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u4ef7\u683c\u626d\u66f2\u3002", "research_question": "\u8bb8\u53ef\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8bb8\u53ef\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52a8\u6001\u8bb8\u53ef\u5e02\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5185\u751f\u4f9b\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u5b9e\u65bd\u65f6\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bb8\u53ef\u5e02\u573a\u4f9b\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bb8\u53ef\u5e02\u573a\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

potential of Ukraine\u2019s stock market, which has remained underdeveloped and was further impacted by martial law. The study systematizes the institutional foundations of the stock market\u2019s organization, particularly under wartime conditions, and highlights key changes in regulatory approaches. Priority is given to the stock market\u2019s role as a mechanism for mobilizing investment resources amid economic and geopolitical instability. The article outlines key legal acts and the responsibilities of regulatory authorities. It identifies two categories of stock market issues: systemic (linked to the overall economic situation) and organizational (addressable through state regulation). Proposed solutions include diversification of financial instruments, development of the corporate segment, improved liquidity, investor trust, and financial literacy. The expected outcomes of the suggested regulatory measures are also presented.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u80a1\u5e02\u5728\u6218\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u4e0e\u6295\u8d44\u6f5c\u529b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u80a1\u5e02\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u4e0e\u6295\u8d44\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6218\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u80a1\u5e02\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u53d7\u6218\u4e89\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u5ea6\u6539\u8fdb\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5236\u5ea6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u80a1\u5e02\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u80a1\u5e02\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u6218\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "findings": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e24\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6218\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u80a1\u5e02\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u76d1\u7ba1\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6559\u80b2\u3002"}}

We characterize a coercive equilibrium in which the algorithmic firm maximizes its profits subject to the incentive compatibility constraint of its rival.  By adopting an algorithm that enables faster pricing and (imperfect) commitment, a firm can unilaterally induce substantially higher equilibrium prices even when its rival maximizes short-run profits and cannot collude. The algorithmic firm can earn profits that exceed its share of collusive profits, and coercive equilibrium outcomes can be worse for consumers than collusive outcomes.

Employing spatial analysis with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, the research quantifies how railway amenities, compared alongside modern, historical, and natural amenities, influence migration inflows. The findings indicate significant regional heterogeneity, with railway track length positively influencing migration, especially in densely populated areas and regions characterized by higher unemployment, elevated housing prices, and a stronger preference for remaining in the EU.

The global understanding of climate change is that it is a challenge. International trade is affected by the impacts of climate change, yet it also acts as a catalyst due to its contribution to deforestation, carbon emissions, and pollution. Thus, it becomes important to introduce sustainable reforms in trade and its growth to ensure that its alignment is such that it fulfils the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper introduces one such reform: integrating Indigenous women into mainstream trade. Indigenous women have refined cultural, social, and economic consciousness connected to nature\u2019s revival and sustenance. The paper aims to highlight why there is a need for sustenance in International Trade and elucidate how Indigenous women, the backbone of society, can serve as facilitators. The paper analyses the current challenges faced in international trade and how Indigenous women can significantly mitigate those challenges if provided with apt legal reforms. This idea is unique in that Indigenous women are being brought into commerce for the sake of improving commerce itself, and not merely in response to their vulnerable situation or to keep them fed. With that said, the seriousness of their marginalisation cannot be underestimated. While Indigenous women have been victims and the vulnerable amongst the vulnerable, they should also be valued for the contribution they can make. When the aboriginal ideas of Indigenous women are shared and protected, it will facilitate inclusive growth in the globalised world. The paper explores how Indigenous women contribute from around the globe by presenting a cross-country study. The paper also draws attention to the legal abyss in current legal frameworks, in incorporating Indigenous women into international trade and how reforms are fundamentally required in the current legal landscape to foster this idea. Reforms in international trade law are the most viable and effective solutions for integrating Indigenous women. The paper further intricately scrutinises the current legal landscape to bring out policy suggestions. The recommendations aim to create a space where Indigenous women and trade could benefit together."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u8d38\u6613\u4e0e\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5987\u5973\u7eb3\u5165\u4e3b\u6d41\u8d38\u6613\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6539\u9769\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5987\u5973\u5728\u8d38\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5987\u5973\u7eb3\u5165\u56fd\u9645\u4e3b\u6d41\u8d38\u6613\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d38\u6613\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u8d38\u6613\u672c\u8eab\u4e5f\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5987\u5973\u56e0\u5176\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8d38\u6613\u7684\u5173\u952e\u529b\u91cf\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\uff08SDGs\uff09\u3001\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5987\u5973\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u9769\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8de8\u56fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "findings": "\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5987\u5973\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8d38\u6613\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u5176\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5987\u5973\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8d38\u6613\u63a8\u52a8\u8005\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d38\u6613\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This forward-thinking model provides a clear roadmap that harness existing institutions by integrating an upstream tax on fuels for power generation, administered by the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (JKDM), with a downstream tax on industrial emissions, managed by the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN). To ensure the highest standards of transparency and international credibility, the entire framework will be anchored by a worldclass digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system overseen by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES). The policy introduces a predictable carbon price, starting at RM40/tCO\u2082e, to give industries the certainty needed for green technology investments. It is carefully designed to protect economic stability through mechanisms that prevent double taxation and support trade-exposed industries. Critically, 100% of the revenue will be reinvested directly into the economy. This will be achieved through a \"Carbon Dividend,\" providing cash assistance to households, and a \"Green Growth\" fund to empower industrial innovation. This ensures a just transition that accelerates Malaysia's decarbonization, enhances national competitiveness, and directly benefits all communities. ."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u78b3\u7a0e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5de9\u56fa\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c14\u5019\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u78b3\u8fb9\u5883\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u5168\u7403\u538b\u529b\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u6e38\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u78b3\u7a0e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u78b3\u7a0e\u6536\u5165\u5c06\u5168\u90e8\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u518d\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bb6\u5ead\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u5b9e\u7528\u53c8\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u78b3\u7a0e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u538b\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u538b\u529b\uff08\u5982\u6b27\u76df\u78b3\u8fb9\u5883\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\uff09\u4fc3\u4f7f\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u53d6\u884c\u52a8\u5de9\u56fa\u5176\u6c14\u5019\u9886\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6df7\u5408\u78b3\u7a0e\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u516c\u6b63\u8f6c\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u6e38\u71c3\u6599\u7a0e\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5de5\u4e1a\u6392\u653e\u7a0e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece2026\u5e74\u5f00\u59cb\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u78b3\u7a0e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u78b3\u7a0e\u6536\u5165\u5c06\u5168\u90e8\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u518d\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bb6\u5ead\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u78b3\u7a0e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u516c\u6b63\u8f6c\u578b\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

The incremental effect of having a child with Down syndrome is to increase the likelihood of parental co-habitation and subsequent child-bearing. These effects exist both in an environment with essentially no prenatal testing \u2013 where the birth of a child with Down syndrome is random conditional on maternal age \u2013 as well as once prenatal screening and testing is more common. In both contexts, total income also increases due to the presence of a generous allowance for families with a child with a disability, but the impact on labor earnings differs. In the \u201cno-testing\u201d environment, having a child with Down syndrome leads to a greater decrease in maternal earnings post-birth relative to having a child without Down syndrome, but this effect reverses sign once testing is available. Our results speak to the impact on families of a child with Down syndrome in a setting where families are largely insured against any additional financial costs.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34064\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u745e\u51781990-2019\u5e74\u7684\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u80b2\u5510\u6c0f\u7efc\u5408\u75c7\u60a3\u513f\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7236\u6bcd\u540c\u5c45\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u751f\u80b2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u56e0\u6b8b\u75be\u6d25\u8d34\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u603b\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u6536\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "research_question": "\u751f\u80b2\u5510\u6c0f\u7efc\u5408\u75c7\u60a3\u513f\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u4ea7\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5510\u6c0f\u7efc\u5408\u75c7\u60a3\u513f\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u8f83\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u745e\u5178\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u745e\u5178\u7684\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75281990-2019\u5e74\u745e\u5178\u7684\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u751f\u80b2\u5510\u6c0f\u7efc\u5408\u75c7\u60a3\u513f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u751f\u80b2\u5510\u6c0f\u7efc\u5408\u75c7\u60a3\u513f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7236\u6bcd\u540c\u5c45\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u751f\u80b2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1b\u5bb6\u5ead\u603b\u6536\u5165\u56e0\u6b8b\u75be\u6d25\u8d34\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u6536\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u4ea7\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u4fdd\u969c\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5510\u6c0f\u7efc\u5408\u75c7\u60a3\u513f\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6b8b\u75be\u513f\u7ae5\u5bb6\u5ead\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

While the creation of Stablecoins may increase the demand for safe dollar-denominated instruments due to reserve backing requirements, they may also serve as substitutes, reducing the global demand for traditional reserve assets. We develop a multicountry model featuring the US, the rest of the world, and a distinct Digital Economy to quantify the impact of the potential expansion of the digital economy. Our results show that, in the long run, the reserve demand effect dominates the substitution effect, leading to lower US interest rates and greater US foreign borrowing.

By reconsidering the historical and empirical record of inflation from 1950s to the early 1990s we show that the persistence of the Great Inflation in the UK cannot fully be explained by these factors, although these can account for some of the major fluctuations. Instead, underlying inflation and inflation expectations appear to be the result of a sequence of regime shifts. We argue those regime shifts are as much related to fundamental changes in fiscal policy as they are to monetary policy and union reforms. Our empirical evidence suggests that fiscal policy was at the heart of many of the problems in the UK during the Great Inflation. In contrast to most of British history, it was not used to stabilise the public finances. Instead, it was used to keep unemployment down and growth up, to subsidise losers from terms of trade shocks and to secure deals with the unions.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34063\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u82f1\u56fd1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u5927\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u2018\u574f\u8fd0\u6c14\u2019\u548c\u2018\u574f\u653f\u7b56\u2019\uff09\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u82f1\u56fd1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u5927\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u5982\u5546\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u51b2\u51fb\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5931\u8d25\uff09\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u901a\u80c0\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u901a\u80c0\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff081950\u5e74\u4ee3\u81f31990\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u7d20\uff09\u662f\u901a\u80c0\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u901a\u80c0\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Economic theory focuses on trade and multinational activity but gives relatively little attention to cross-border mergers, while finance research emphasizes empirical studies of mergers but rarely integrates broader economic theories. This chapter aims to synthesize these two literatures into a unified framework for understanding multinational firms and cross-border mergers.  The discussion is organized around the decision-making process of multinational firms, from choosing to operate internationally to selecting between greenfield investment and mergers.  This framework reveals the theoretical and empirical evidence on the drivers of multinational production,  including productivity gains, knowledge transfers, and market frictions. The findings highlight the commonality between the two literatures, but also suggests that greater integration between economic theory and finance research will generate a deeper understanding of the role of multinational firms in the global economy.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34067\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6574\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u8de8\u5883\u5e76\u8d2d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u8de8\u5883\u5e76\u8d2d\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u5bf9\u5176\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u5272\u88c2\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5173\u6ce8\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u8de8\u56fd\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u5219\u4fa7\u91cd\u5e76\u8d2d\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6574\u5408\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7eff\u5730\u6295\u8d44\u4e0e\u5e76\u8d2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6469\u64e6\u7b49\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6574\u5408\u3002", "findings": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u56fd\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5171\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

That relationship has now changed: mental despair declines monotonically with age due to a rise in despair among the young.  However, the relationship between age and mental despair differs by labor market status. The hump-shape in age still exists for those who are unable to work and the unemployed.  The relation between mental despair and age is broadly flat, and has remained so, for homemakers, students and the retired.  The change in the age-despair profile over time is due to increasing despair among young workers.  Whilst the relationship between mental despair and age has always been downward sloping among workers, this relationship has become more pronounced due to a rise in mental despair among young workers.

A disability may raise the time cost of all activities; of some\u2014making them differentially less worth doing; or it may make switching activities more costly. The first yields no predictions about time use, but the latter two possibilities both predict that fewer activities will be undertaken, with more time spent on each. These explanations describe our findings based on non-working ATUS 2008-22 respondents ages 70+, 32 percent of whom self-assess a disability. Data from the Polish Time Use Survey, where disability is medically certified, show similar results; and they demonstrate the same loss of variety over multiple days. Remarkably similar basic results are found using homogenized British, Canadian, French, Spanish, and Italian time-diaries. Overall, a mobility/physical disability leads an otherwise identical person to engage in over 10 percent fewer activities on a typical day.

Their temporal flexibility\u2014the ability to shift workloads over time\u2014offers a source of demand-side flexibility. We model power systems in three U.S. regions: Mid-Atlantic, Texas, and WECC, under varying flexibility levels. We evaluate flexibility&apos;s effects on grid operations, investment, system costs, and emissions. Across all scenarios, flexible data centers reduce costs by shifting load from peak to off-peak hours, flattening net demand, and supporting renewable and baseload resources. This load shifting facilitates renewable integration while improving the utilization of existing baseload capacity. As a result, the emissions impact depends on which effect dominates. Higher renewable penetration increases the emissions-reduction potential of data center flexibility, while lower shares favor baseload generation and may raise emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning data center flexibility with renewable deployment and regional conditions.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34065\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff08\u8c03\u6574\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u57fa\u8f7d\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6392\u653e\u5f71\u54cd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6392\u653e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u662f\u589e\u957f\u6700\u5feb\u7684\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u8131\u78b3\u76ee\u6807\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9700\u6c42\u4fa7\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e09\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\uff08Mid-Atlantic\u3001Texas\u548cWECC\uff09\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u79fb\u8d1f\u8f7d\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u57fa\u8f7d\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u6392\u653e\u5f71\u54cd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u6392\u653e\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u9700\u4e0e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u533a\u57df\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Endowment use varies systematically across sectors and revenue models. Organizations with endowments scale mission-related spending more effectively and hedge revenue risk through asset allocation. Yet most endowments underperform passive benchmarks, with the weakest performance concentrated among smaller, self-managed funds. Advisory fees are positively correlated with gross returns but negatively with net returns, suggesting overpayment for investment services.

We unveil the workings of this opaque industry by drawing on universal administrative business-to-business transaction data based on value-added tax links from Belgium (2002-2023). These data permit us to document the nature of consulting engagements, take-up patterns, and the effects on client firms. We document that consulting take-up is concentrated among large, high-labor-productivity firms. For TFP and profitability, we find a U-shaped pattern: both high and low performers hire consultants. New clients spend on average 3% of payroll on consulting, typically in episodic engagements lasting less than one year. Using difference-in-differences designs exploiting these sharp consulting events, we find positive effects on labor productivity of 3.6% over five years, driven by modest employment reductions alongside stable or growing revenue. Average wages rise by 2.7% with no decline in labor\u2019s share of value added, suggesting productivity gains do not come at workers\u2019 expense through rent-shifting. We do observe organizational restructuring with small increases in dismissal rates, and higher services procurement but reduced labor outsourcing. Our heterogeneity analysis reveals larger productivity gains for initially less productive firms, suggesting improvements in allocative efficiency. Our findings broadly align with ex-ante predictions from surveyed academic economists and consulting professionals, validating the productivity-enhancing view of consulting endorsed by most practitioners though only half of academics, while lending less support to a rent-shifting view favored by many economists.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34072\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u54a8\u8be2\u884c\u4e1a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5927\u578b\u9ad8\u52b3\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9TFP\u548c\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u5448\u73b0U\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u65b0\u5ba2\u6237\u5e73\u5747\u5c063%\u7684\u85aa\u8d44\u7528\u4e8e\u54a8\u8be2\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u5305\u62ec\u52b3\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f34\u968f\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "research_question": "\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u54a8\u8be2\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u54a8\u8be2\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u79df\u91d1\u8f6c\u79fb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6bd4\u5229\u65f62002-2023\u5e74\u7684\u589e\u503c\u7a0e\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u54a8\u8be2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u5bf9TFP\u548c\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u5448U\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u52b3\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4f34\u968f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u79df\u91d1\u8f6c\u79fb\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u652f\u6301\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54a8\u8be2\u5bf9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Among the most contentious issues is whether these immobilized assets\u2014estimated at over $300 billion\u2014should be repurposed to fund Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction and war recovery. This paper explores the legal, economic, and moral complexities surrounding the seizure of Russian sovereign assets. It examines the viability of measures like the REPO Act in the United States, the risks of undermining international legal norms such as sovereign immunity, and the potential global financial consequences. At the same time, it highlights the urgent reconstruction needs of Ukraine, as estimated in the RDNA3 report by the World Bank and partners, which places the cost at $486 billion over the next decade. The paper argues that moral and strategic imperatives may justify the use of Russian assets under the doctrine of collective countermeasures, while urging international coordination to ensure legitimacy, deterrence, and sustainable recovery. The study contributes to the broader debate on post-war reparations, accountability in international relations, and the economic foundations of post-conflict reconstruction.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u4e3b\u6743\u8d44\u4ea7\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u5f8b\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u91cd\u5efa\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "research_question": "\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u4e3b\u6743\u8d44\u4ea7\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u52a9\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6218\u540e\u6062\u590d\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5165\u4fb5\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u540e\uff0c\u897f\u65b9\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5236\u88c1\u5e76\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e86\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7f6e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u4ea7\u6210\u4e3a\u4e89\u8bae\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e3b\u6743\u8c41\u514d\u3001\u96c6\u4f53\u53cd\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u5b66\u8bf4\u3001\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cd5\u6848\uff08\u5982REPO\u6cd5\u6848\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u56fd\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u6218\u7565\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u56fd\u9645\u534f\u8c03\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6218\u540e\u8d54\u507f\u3001\u56fd\u9645\u5173\u7cfb\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u540e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u56fd\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d44\u4ea7\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

In a general class of spatial equilibrium models, we provide a formula for aggregate welfare changes, decomposed into terms associated with (i) technology (Fogel 1964, Hulten 1978), (ii) spatial dispersion of marginal utility, (iii) fiscal externalities, (iv) technological externalities, and (v) redistribution. We further use this decomposition to derive a general formula for optimal spatial transfers and show that, whenever optimal transfers are in place, the technology term alone captures the aggregate welfare effects of technological shocks. We apply our framework to study welfare gains from improving the US highway network. We find that changes in the spatial dispersion of marginal utility are as important as technological externalities in accounting for the deviations from the Fogel-Hulten benchmark to assess welfare gains.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34075\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u51b2\u51fb\u6216\u4ea4\u901a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6539\u5584\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4f53\u798f\u5229\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u798f\u5229\u53d8\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u5206\u6563\u3001\u8d22\u653f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u3001\u6280\u672f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u518d\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u533a\u57df\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u51b2\u51fb\u6216\u4ea4\u901a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6539\u5584\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4f53\u798f\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u798f\u5229\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u901a\u7528\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eFogel\uff081964\uff09\u548cHulten\uff081978\uff09\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u798f\u5229\u53d8\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u5206\u6563\u3001\u8d22\u653f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u3001\u6280\u672f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u518d\u5206\u914d\u4e94\u9879\u3002", "findings": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u5206\u6563\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u5bf9\u798f\u5229\u504f\u79bbFogel-Hulten\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u798f\u5229\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f8e\u56fd\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u6539\u5584\u7684\u798f\u5229\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This paper tackles a different question:  why does culture change?  The underlying premise adopted here is that culture changes because incentives change, transforming actions and beliefs. An idiosyncratic review of the literature follows that illustrates how the environment (e.g., the prevalence of pathogens or the suitability of land for pastoralism) and historical experiences (e.g., colonization, war, or migration) can affect relationships of power in society and shape people\u2019s beliefs.  It then examines the role of new information and ideas (i.e., learning) and finally the role of policies in shaping incentives and changing culture.  A second part of the paper reviews work that models the mechanisms of cultural change more explicitly, using quantitative models to examine the interplay between economic incentives and evolving beliefs or preferences and to study the importance of intermediating mechanisms.  Given that one of the most profound cultural and economic transformations of the past 150 years concerns gender roles, this theme recurs throughout.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34077\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u6587\u5316\u53d8\u8fc1\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u56e0\u6fc0\u52b1\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u5316\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6587\u5316\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5df2\u88ab\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5bb6\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53d8\u8fc1\u539f\u56e0\u4ecd\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6587\u5316\u53d8\u8fc1\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6587\u5316\u53d8\u8fc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u6fc0\u52b1\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u5316\u53d8\u8fc1\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u5316\u53d8\u8fc1\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6fc0\u52b1\u6539\u53d8\u6587\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Our setting is Italy, where employers are required to comply with occupation- and industry-specific wage floors set by national collective bargaining agreements. We show that opting out of these agreements reduces wages but increases workers\u2019 employment and retention within firms. These effects are most pronounced in the more productive North, where the overall impact on workers\u2019 earnings is slightly positive. In contrast, in the South, wage losses outweigh employment gains, leading to a net decline in earnings. We also find that increased wage-setting flexibility is associated with higher firm survival rates in both regions.

Moving from autarky to free trade induces countries to introduce green subsidies and reduce carbon taxes, in order to reduce foreign emissions. In contrast to the \u201cleakage\u201d effect of carbon taxes, green subsidies are associated with \u201creverse leakage,\u201d as they decrease emissions both at home and abroad, and as a consequence, the availability of green subsidies tends to be good for global welfare. International climate agreements (ICAs) seek to increase carbon taxes, but the effect on green subsidies is more nuanced. An ICA removes green subsidies, even though they exert positive international externalities at the noncooperative equilibrium. If, however, policies can only be changed gradually, an ICA may start by increasing subsidies before decreasing them over time. We also consider the welfare implications of lobbying from the fossil and green energy sectors. In a noncooperative setting, we find that pressures from the fossil lobby tend to reduce welfare, whereas pressures from the green lobby tend to increase welfare. We also find that in the presence of lobbying, an ICA can decrease welfare relative to the noncooperative equilibrium, even if it changes carbon taxes and green subsidies toward their efficient levels.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34080\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u78b3\u7a0e\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u8d38\u6613\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fd\u9645\u6c14\u5019\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6e38\u8bf4\u5bf9\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5f00\u653e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u78b3\u7a0e\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6392\u653e\u548c\u5168\u7403\u798f\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u7531\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u78b3\u7a0e\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\uff09\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6392\u653e\u548c\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fd\u9645\u6c14\u5019\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6e38\u8bf4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u78b3\u7a0e\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u5747\u8861\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6392\u653e\u548c\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u81ea\u7531\u8d38\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u78b3\u7a0e\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\u5177\u6709\u201c\u53cd\u5411\u6cc4\u6f0f\u201d\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u56fd\u9645\u6c14\u5019\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\uff1b\u6e38\u8bf4\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u798f\u5229\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u5168\u7403\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u5747\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u56fd\u9645\u6c14\u5019\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7eff\u8272\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u798f\u5229\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6e38\u8bf4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

Using user-level data, we find that participation is significantly higher in cities that have experienced faster vegetation growth. We propose a \u201cgreen experience\u201d mechanism: visible environmental improvement fosters greater appreciation for nature and increases support for sustainability efforts elsewhere. Survey evidence supports this mechanism, with participants also citing gamification and warm glow as key motivators. We further document spillover effects: Ant Forest participation boosts donations to external environmental projects and increases overall use of the Alipay app. These findings highlight the potential of digital platforms to scale climate action while creating shared environmental and economic value.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34074\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u5982\u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d\u7684\u8682\u8681\u68ee\u6797\uff09\u80fd\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u73af\u4fdd\u652f\u6301\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u521b\u9020\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u57ce\u5e02\u690d\u88ab\u589e\u957f\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u7eff\u8272\u4f53\u9a8c\u201d\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8fd8\u5e26\u6765\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5982\u589e\u52a0\u73af\u4fdd\u6350\u8d60\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u8682\u8681\u68ee\u6797\uff09\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u7684\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u521b\u9020\u4ef7\u503c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u52a8\u5458\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7eff\u8272\u4f53\u9a8c\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u6fc0\u52b1\u3001\u6e29\u6696\u6548\u5e94\uff08warm glow\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "findings": "1. \u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u57ce\u5e02\u690d\u88ab\u589e\u957f\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b2. \u7eff\u8272\u4f53\u9a8c\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\uff1b3. \u6e38\u620f\u5316\u548c\u6e29\u6696\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u52a8\u673a\uff1b4. \u53c2\u4e0e\u5e26\u6765\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5982\u73af\u4fdd\u6350\u8d60\u589e\u52a0\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u7eff\u8272\u4f53\u9a8c\u201d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u6539\u5584\u589e\u5f3a\u73af\u4fdd\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u73af\u4fdd\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53cc\u91cd\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Because AI reviews are relatively inexpensive compared to manual assessments, referees would otherwise delegate fully, which undermines quality. The paper shows that moderate detection of manipulation can paradoxically improve welfare. With intermediate detection probabilities, only low-quality authors undertake manipulation, and detection becomes informative about quality, inducing referees to mix between manual and AI reviews. This partially separating equilibrium preserves the value of peer review when AI quality is intermediate. When detection is too low, all bad papers are manipulated and the market unravels; when detection is perfect, referees use only AI and acceptance collapses. Thus, some prompt injection must be tolerated to sustain the market: it disciplines referees and generates information. The results caution against zero-tolerance enforcement and highlight how prompt injection can, counterintuitively, play a welfare-enhancing role when AI reviews are easily produced.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34082\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b66\u672f\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2dAI\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f5c\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u6307\u4ee4\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\u64cd\u7eb5AI\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u798f\u5229\uff0c\u800c\u96f6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6216\u5b8c\u7f8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff1f", "motivation": "AI\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56AI\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u4f5c\u8005\u64cd\u7eb5AI\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u59d4\u6258\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u5747\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u3002", "findings": "\u9002\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f5c\u8005\u4f1a\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u548cAI\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u96f6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6216\u5b8c\u7f8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u79bb\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u907f\u514d\u96f6\u5bb9\u5fcd\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u5e02\u573a\u529f\u80fd\u3002"}}

We concentrate our analysis on three particularly common forms of subsidies: (i) a per-unit subsidy, (ii) an ad valorem subsidy, and (iii) an \u201cinversely related\u201d subsidy, which increases as the price of the target good decreases. To evaluate the price effects of the subsidies, we rely on two criteria, an \u201cequal-relief\u201d criterion\u2014which relies on a pass-through analysis\u2014and a cost-effectiveness criterion. Overall, the ad valorem subsidy always yields the strongest price-increasing effect, whereas an inversely related subsidy leads to the lowest price increase. Consequently, the ad valorem subsidy induces the largest output expansion under perfect competition, whereas the inversely related subsidy dominates the other subsidies in a monopoly under both criteria. Those findings are consistent with several empirical facts, such as observed price differences for green target goods across European countries."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u5784\u65ad\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8865\u8d34\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u8865\u8d34\uff1a\u5355\u4f4d\u8865\u8d34\u3001\u4ece\u4ef7\u8865\u8d34\u548c\u201c\u53cd\u5411\u76f8\u5173\u201d\u8865\u8d34\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u4ef7\u8865\u8d34\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u53cd\u5411\u76f8\u5173\u8865\u8d34\u6548\u679c\u6700\u5f31\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e0d\u540c\u8865\u8d34\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5355\u4f4d\u8865\u8d34\u3001\u4ece\u4ef7\u8865\u8d34\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u76f8\u5173\u8865\u8d34\uff09\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u5784\u65ad\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u6709\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8865\u8d34\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u4ea7\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u5784\u65ad\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u7b49\u91cf\u7f13\u89e3\u201d\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "findings": "\u4ece\u4ef7\u8865\u8d34\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u76f8\u5173\u8865\u8d34\u6548\u679c\u6700\u5f31\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u4e0b\u4ece\u4ef7\u8865\u8d34\u5bf9\u4ea7\u51fa\u6269\u5f20\u6548\u679c\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u5784\u65ad\u4e0b\u53cd\u5411\u76f8\u5173\u8865\u8d34\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8865\u8d34\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u8865\u8d34\u5f62\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7eff\u8272\u76ee\u6807\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

While research has focused on the effect of training on reemployment, its impact on labour supply in shortage occupations remains understudied. Tracking 101,337 unemployed individuals over 24 months in France, including 3,935 trainees, we estimate the effect of qualifying training using Dynamic Inverse Probability Weighting. Results show that training focused on shortage occupations does not increase employment duration in these occupations in the medium term, except for men. When replicating the analysis on a cohort entering unemployment in 2019, thus exposed to a less favourable economic context including the COVID-19 crisis, we find that such training increases time spent in shortage occupations by an average of 40 days over 42 months.

In the long run, a heavy reliance via this Singapore entity might not benefit Indonesia, as Indonesia might miss significant opportunities and foreign investments. In addition, the dependency that occurs because of such practices may increase unnecessary costs that founders and investors may need to bear.

In other words, there is strong evidence that drought in the hinterlands/countryside contributes to the increase in crime rates in both urban and rural municipalities.

We document patterns of absolute inequality, relative inequality and social mobility for India as a whole as well as for Indian states grouped by level of development. The analysis uses easy to understand indexes constructed using selected percentiles and percentile ratios of household consumption expenditures from the National Sample Surveys for 1983 to 2011-12. We augment the analysis of inequality and social mobility with an assessment of the degree to which the states are diverging in these respects over time. Throughout the paper, we compare the patterns revealed by the percentile measures with those based on corresponding Gini coefficients. The investigation reveals three distinct subperiods across major Indian states during which inequality and social mobility stand in different relation to each other.

Two organizations first choose whether to operate as standard for-profit or as mission-oriented firms, and then compete in both the labor and the user markets. Mission-oriented firms have higher unit costs but attract better-motivated workers. Service quality is endogenously determined through the sorting of intrinsically motivated workers and depends on the firm\u2019s ownership type. We show that all market structures\u2014standard, mission-oriented, or mixed\u2014 can arise in equilibrium, and that mixed structures can be Pareto superior by efficiently allocating the most motivated workers to the mission-oriented firm while preserving the cost advantage of the other firm. While equilibrium outcomes generally diverge from the social optimum due to externalities and lack of coordination, they are both driven by the trade-off between cost-efficiency and motivation.

We test if the relation 80-20 is found in bird communities in remaining large continuous forests of southern Brazil, which were sampled seasonally over two years using point counts. We also did a preliminary test in forest fragments, which were sampled monthly over one year. Our study focusses on six ecological services provided by birds. We used field data on species abundance of bird communities from 15 localities of three distinct types of continuous forests. We calculated biomass of each ecological service. So, we expect that 80% of biomass be represented by 20% of species in each ecological service. Overall, 270 bird species were recorded and 50 of them, 18.5%, represent 80% of total biomass.

Policy makers, in turn, are very interested in identifying such opportunities in order to minimize heavy-handed government interventions and thus maintain public support for environmental policy. We revisit this issue by examining a case where low-cost environmentalism should be highly prevalent: choosing tap water over bottled water, a form of pro-environmental behavior that not only saves consumers money but also has a very substantial environmental protection benefit. Using an experimental approach with a large representative sample of Switzerland&apos;s adult resident population (N=5,960), we tested whether increasing awareness of three key advantages of tap water \u2014 (1) health effects, (2) environmental benefits, and (3) cost savings \u2014 could shift consumption behavior toward tap water. Our findings reveal that only combined information addressing all three aspects increases the likelihood of choosing tap water over bottled water, and this effect is very small. These results suggest that even under seemingly ideal conditions for voluntary pro-environmental action, information campaigns alone may be insufficient for reducing the environmental footprint of consumption, and that policy-makers should consider stronger (dis-)incentives in this domain."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u4e2a\u4eba\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u66f4\u613f\u610f\u53c2\u4e0e\u81ea\u613f\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u624d\u4f1a\u7565\u5fae\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u6765\u6c34\u800c\u975e\u74f6\u88c5\u6c34\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u6765\u6c34\u800c\u975e\u74f6\u88c5\u6c34\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u653f\u5e9c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u73af\u4fdd\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u4fe1\u606f\u5ba3\u4f20\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u745e\u58eb\u6210\u5e74\u5c45\u6c11\uff08N=5,960\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6837\u672c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u73af\u5883\u3001\u6210\u672c\uff09\u5bf9\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u6765\u6c34\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u4ec5\u5f53\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u6765\u6c34\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7565\u6709\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u9650\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5ba3\u4f20\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u6216\u60e9\u7f5a\u63aa\u65bd\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8db3\u8ff9\u3002"}}

The high-frequency event study method regresses changes in an outcome variable on a measure of unexpected changes in a policy variable in a narrow time window around an event or a policy announcement (e.g., a 30-minute window around an FOMC announcement). We show that, contrary to popular belief, the narrow size of the window is not sufficient for identification. Rather, the population regression coefficient identifies a causal estimand when (i) the effect of the policy shock on the outcome does not depend on the other variables (separability) and (ii) the surprise component of the news or event dominates all other variables that are present in the event window (relative exogeneity). Technically, the latter condition requires the ratio between the variance of the policy shock and that of the other variables to be infinite in the event window. Under these conditions, we establish the causal meaning of the event study estimand corresponding to the regression coefficient and super-consistency of the event study estimator with rate of convergence faster than the parametric rate. We show the asymptotic normality of the estimator and propose bias-corrected inference. We also provide bounds on the worst-case bias and use them to quantify its impact on the worst-case coverage properties of confidence intervals, as well as to construct a bias-aware critical value.

While investment-led growth may offer quick wins, it is efficiency, innovation, and institutional reform that will determine Ukraine's long-term economic trajectory. Drawing on rich micro-level firm data spanning 25 years, this paper uncovers deep structural distortions that have suppressed creative destruction and productivity in Ukraine. It finds that business dynamism is on the decline, alongside rising market concentration among incumbent businesses, including low productivity state owned enterprises. To inform priorities for reviving business dynamism, this study develops a model of creative destruction drawing on Acemoglu et al. (2018) and Akcigit et al. (2021). The quantitative assessment highlights that policies that discipline entrenched incumbents are the bedrock for reviving business dynamism and engineer Ukraine's <i>Wirtschaftswunder</i>.

It aims to explore the demographic characteristics of instructors; the leadership styles used onboard ships, the perceived leadership styles in the academic classroom from students' perspectives, barriers to integrating these leadership styles, and the relationship between leadership styles and integration barriers. A descriptive correlational research design was utilized to examine the relationship between instructor demographics, leadership styles, and the challenges of integrating these styles into academic classrooms. Data was collected through a questionnaire administered to maritime instructors and students at the college. The questionnaire includes items on demographics, leadership styles, and perceived barriers. Statistical analysis, including descriptive and inferential statistics, analyzes the data and determines the relationships between variables. The research instruments undergo validation through expert review, pilot testing, and face and content validity considerations. The study's conclusions highlight the leadership styles of maritime instructors, student perceptions, integration barriers, discrepancies between self-assessments and student assessments, and the relationship between leadership styles and barriers. Maritime instructors employ transactional, transformational, and authentic leadership styles, but improvements in communication and addressing certain issues are needed. Students have a positive perception of their instructors, recognizing empowering behaviors. Integration barriers include resistance, training gaps, cultural influences, and policies. Aligning instructors' and students' perceptions is crucial. Increasing the prominence of leadership styles reduces barriers.

Keeping a distance to an infected person serves as a protective measure against an infection. When an infected person moves closer, risk of infection increases. Participants were aware of this fact, but underestimated the rate at which the risk of infection increases when getting closer to an infected person, e.g., from 1.5 to 0.5 m (perceived risk increase = 3.33 times higher, objective = 9.00 times higher). This is alarming because it means that people can take risks of infection that they are not aware of or want to take, when they approach another possibly virus infected person. Correspondingly, when an infected person moves away the speed of risk decrease was underestimated, meaning that people are not aware of how much safer they will be if they move away from an infected person. The perceived risk reducing effects of a face mask were approximately correct. Judgments of infection risk at different interpersonal distances (with or without a mask) were unrelated to how often a person used a mask, avoided others or canceled meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater worry in general and in particular over COVID-19, correlated positively with more protective behavior during the pandemic, but not with judgments of infection risk at different interpersonal distances. Participants with higher scores on a cognitive numeracy test judged mask efficiency more correctly, and women were more worried and risk avoiding than men. The results have implications for understanding behavior in a pandemic, and are relevant for risk communications about the steep increase in risk when approaching a person who may be infected with an airborne virus."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u4e0e\u611f\u67d3\u8005\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u4ea4\u8c08\u65f6\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb\u7f29\u77ed\u65f6\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u53e3\u7f69\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8f83\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u611f\u67d3\u8005\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u53e3\u7f69\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "findings": "\u4eba\u4eec\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb\u7f29\u77ed\u65f6\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u53e3\u7f69\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8f83\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

The literature generally treats numerical response categories as if they represent equal psychological intervals. We provide the first systematic test of this assumption, developing a general framework to quantify how easily results can be overturned when this linearity assumption is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that respondents interpret survey scales in ways that do deviate from linearity, but only mildly. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 30,000+ coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics journals. Replicated coefficient signs are remarkably robust to mild departures from linear scale-use. However, statistical inference and estimates of relative effect magnitudes become unreliable, even under modest departures from linearity. This is especially problematic for policy applications.

Using French firm-level export data, I find that advance notice halves the negative impact of TBTs on export participation, by reducing temporary exits and supporting entry, particularly among small and medium-sized firms. Exploiting variation in notification delays, I show that this effect operates by reducing uncertainty about compliance costs, rather than by giving firms more time to adjust. A theoretical framework with firm heterogeneity and trade policy uncertainty formalizes this mechanism: notification lowers uncertainty, reducing firms\u2019 incentives to delay or suspend exports.

Rather than contemplating a relocation to more climatically favorable regions, Dayton opted for proactive measures, collaborating with designer Victor Gruen to conceive a comfortable and accessible retail environment for Minnesota consumers. In 1952, Dayton and Gruen publicly introduced their schematics for Southdale, which would become the United States' inaugural enclosed, climate-controlled shopping mall. Gruen's aspiration was to forge a novel paradigm of American community, drawing inspiration from exemplary European urban planning principles. The Dayton Corporation subsequently acquired 500 acres in Edina, upon which Gruen meticulously designed a development positioning the mall as the nucleus of an integrated community featuring residential complexes, educational institutions, a medical facility, a park, and a lake.</span></p>\n<div>\n <p><span>The pervasive decline in social capital across the United States, meticulously documented by Robert D. Putnam in Bowling Alone, finds a compelling, albeit tragic, parallel in the widespread closure of American shopping malls. Putnam's seminal work illuminates a severe erosion of civic engagement, interpersonal trust, and associational life since the mid-20th century, arguing that the shift from collective pursuits to individualized activities undermines the very foundations of community and democratic vitality. Intriguingly, the shopping mall, particularly in its pioneering manifestations like Southdale Center, was initially conceived precisely as a response to perceived social fragmentation, designed by visionaries such as Victor Gruen to serve as a modern communal nexus, replicating the vibrant urban squares of Europe.&nbsp;</span><span>The early mall, with its climate-controlled interior, central atriums, and array of amenities, deliberately fostered conditions for both bonding social capital (facilitating gatherings among like-minded groups) and crucially, bridging social capital (creating spaces for incidental encounters among diverse individuals). They offered not merely retail opportunities but environments for social interaction, leisure, and a sense of shared public life.

Mirroring Heckman sample selection bias, this selfcensorship skews disclosed emissions into non-random samples, distorting climate risk pricing and policy. We bridge economic problem and machine learning, proposing a Heckman-inspired three-step framework in high-dimensional settings to correct for strategic non-disclosure and ensure variable selection consistency in the presence of sample selection bias. By integrating kernel group lasso (KG-lasso) and double machine learning (DML) from neighbouring firms, i.e., using information from carbon next door, we unveil systematic underestimation: empirical analysis of 3444 unique US firms (2010-2023) rejects the null of no selection bias. Our findings indicate that voluntary disclosure induces adverse selection, where green silence rewards polluters and undermines decarbonization. Underestimation translates to a $2.6 billion shortfall in tax revenues and up to $525 billion hidden social cost of carbon."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u613f\u78b3\u62ab\u9732\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u7eff\u8272\u6c89\u9ed8\u201d\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u81ea\u613f\u78b3\u62ab\u9732\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u626d\u66f2\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u653f\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u81ea\u613f\u78b3\u62ab\u9732\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7684\u975e\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Heckman\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6838\u7fa4Lasso\uff08KG-lasso\uff09\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DML\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7Heckman\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e09\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408KG-lasso\u548cDML\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u90bb\u8fd1\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u78b3\u90bb\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u7ea0\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u67903444\u5bb6\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\uff082010-2023\u5e74\uff09\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\u65e0\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u96f6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u81ea\u613f\u62ab\u9732\u5bfc\u81f4\u9006\u5411\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f4e\u4f30\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a0e\u6536\u77ed\u7f3a26\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u548c\u9ad8\u8fbe5250\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u793e\u4f1a\u6210\u672c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea0\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u613f\u78b3\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Returns to quality increase with economic development level of destination cities.

We utilize the first nationally representative sample linking enslaved and free people - the 1/100 sample microdata files of the 1850 Census of Population from Schedule 1 on free people, and Schedule 2 on the enslaved population - to identify the slaveholders and their slaveholdings. The reduced form regression analyses consider both owning at least one enslaved person, and among slaveholders the number held. The findings indicate that 90 percent of the enslaved population were reportedly held by free males, that among men this was more likely for those who were married, but among women it was lower for the married, that for both genders slaveholding increased with age, being literate, and having been born in the US. Moreover, it varied by free men&apos;s occupation, in part because of the extent of self-employment and in part due to their wealth. While most slaveholders were self-employed farmers, many of the slaveholders were professionals, including clergy, doctors, and lawyers who used enslaved people in their household, in their professional practice, or in the farms/plantations that they also owned."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u5185\u6218\u524d\u5357\u65b9\u5404\u5dde\u81ea\u7531\u4eba\u53e3\u4e2d\u88ab\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e3a\u5974\u96b6\u4e3b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u75281850\u5e74\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b090%\u7684\u5974\u96b6\u7531\u81ea\u7531\u7537\u6027\u6301\u6709\uff0c\u4e14\u5974\u96b6\u4e3b\u7279\u5f81\u56e0\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5a5a\u59fb\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5185\u6218\u524d\u5357\u65b9\u81ea\u7531\u4eba\u53e3\u4e2d\u5974\u96b6\u4e3b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5974\u96b6\u4e3b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5974\u96b6\u5236\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5974\u96b6\u5236\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75281850\u5e74\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "90%\u7684\u5974\u96b6\u7531\u81ea\u7531\u7537\u6027\u6301\u6709\uff0c\u5974\u96b6\u4e3b\u7279\u5f81\u56e0\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5a5a\u59fb\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5974\u96b6\u4e3b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5974\u96b6\u5236\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5974\u96b6\u5236\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Combining data on central bank balance sheets with market data on asset prices, we provide evidence on the evolution and determinants of financial risk-taking by 18 advanced economy central banks. Based on the estimated Value at Risk (VaR), we document that average central bank balance sheet risk increased to about 3 percent of GDP. Central banks took more risk in periods of low policy rates, less expansionary fiscal policies, and more favorable growth prospects.

First, we document the effect of a large, systematic monetary tightening (ECB rate increases from 0% to 4.5% during 2022-23), with average firm-level innovation cuts of 20%. These cuts persist over the medium term, indicating a sustained innovation slowdown. Second, we use the survey to identify elasticities of innovation expenditure to exogenous policy rate changes. Responses to hikes and cuts are significant and largely symmetric at the baseline rate (4.5%), though we detect potential state-dependent asymmetry due to the extensive margin. The financing channel emerges as one of the transmission channels, with more pronounced effects in firms with higher shares of bank loans and variable-rate loans. Crucially, we show that monetary policy transmits via aggregate demand, with stronger responses in firms with pessimistic demand expectations. Forward guidance provides substantial additional stimulus by reducing uncertainty about future rates, suggesting long-term, supply-side effects of announcements. These results challenge monetary long-run neutrality and are suggestive of policy endogeneity of R\u2217 operating through innovation-driven technology growth."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u5c42\u9762\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8d27\u5e01\u7d27\u7f29\uff082022-23\u5e74\u6b27\u6d32\u592e\u884c\u5229\u7387\u4ece0%\u5347\u81f34.5%\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f01\u4e1a\u521b\u65b0\u6295\u8d44\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1120%\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u652f\u51fa\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u5229\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u878d\u8d44\u6e20\u9053\u548c\u603b\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "research_question": "\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6295\u8d44\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u521b\u65b0\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u878d\u8d44\u6e20\u9053\u548c\u603b\u9700\u6c42\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4f01\u4e1a\u5c42\u9762\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u8d27\u5e01\u7d27\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u521b\u65b0\u6295\u8d44\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c1120%\uff0c\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u6301\u7eed\uff1b\u878d\u8d44\u6e20\u9053\u548c\u603b\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u957f\u671f\u4e2d\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5185\u751f\u6027\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u6307\u5f15\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While previous studies have broadly analyzed general correlations between financial resources and athletic success, this research narrows the scope to assess how specific factors-including but not limited to NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) funding, ticket revenue, return on investment, and revenue-relate to team winning percentages. The research question is: What are the winning percentages of college basketball teams in the Big East Conference, in relation to their economics (tax dollars paid, tuition, or revenue made from sports events)? This topic is especially relevant as NIL policies and changing revenue structures are reshaping college athletics. To answer this question, a correlational research design and quantitative method were used to conduct the research by gathering economic data and analyzing the relationship between financial investment and winning percentages. The findings suggest that while general financial investment does not guarantee higher winning percentages, targeted spending-particularly in areas like NIL deals and athletic-specific contributions-has a stronger correlation with success. These results are important because they can help athletic directors, administrators, and policymakers optimize both team success and economic gain by understanding the key factors that contribute to performance."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86NCAA\u4e00\u7ea7\u7537\u5b50\u7bee\u7403\u7403\u961f\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u4e1c\u8054\u76df\uff09\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u652f\u51fa\uff08\u5982NIL\u4ea4\u6613\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u4e13\u9879\u8d21\u732e\uff09\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "research_question": "\u5927\u4e1c\u8054\u76df\u5927\u5b66\u7bee\u7403\u961f\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u4e0e\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u7a0e\u6536\u3001\u5b66\u8d39\u6216\u4f53\u80b2\u8d5b\u4e8b\u6536\u5165\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740NIL\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u6536\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u91cd\u5851\u5927\u5b66\u4f53\u80b2\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5b9a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u80dc\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u603b\u4f53\u8d22\u52a1\u6295\u8d44\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u652f\u51fa\uff08\u5982NIL\u4ea4\u6613\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u4e13\u9879\u8d21\u732e\uff09\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6210\u529f\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f53\u80b2\u603b\u76d1\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u4f18\u5316\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u529f\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Several jurisdictions have already adopted or are preparing regulations to meet the challenges of the rise of AI in the global digital economy. The Indo-Pacific region has emerged as a potential epicentre of the future digital economy; however, to achieve this goal, it must attempt to create a coherent regulatory framework for digital technologies. If successful, the Indo-Pacific region can also make an important legal contribution to the future global AI governance framework, as the present multilateral framework at the global level established by the United Nations and World Trade Organization (WTO) system was created before the digital era, is fragmented and therefore inadequate to meet the legal challenges posed by AI. Critically sketching out the narrative of the global AI debate, the article exemplifies the main regulatory challenges posed by the distinct technological features of AI and its future evolutions. The article concludes that meeting these challenges will require a new mind-set to set up a regulatory framework capable of meeting the complex problems caused by the cross-cutting nature of AI and related technologies as well as the disruptive effects they exert on the economy, society and individual lives."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u5728\u5168\u7403\u76d1\u7ba1\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5370\u592a\u5730\u533a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u672f\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u592a\u5730\u533a\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u672f\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6311\u6218\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5168\u7403\u591a\u8fb9\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u548cWTO\u4f53\u7cfb\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u524d\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5370\u592a\u5730\u533a\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5168\u7403AI\u6cbb\u7406\u505a\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u672f\u76d1\u7ba1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6280\u672f\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u8ba8\u8bba\u548c\u5370\u592a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u5370\u592a\u5730\u533a\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u601d\u7ef4\u5efa\u7acb\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6027\u548c\u98a0\u8986\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5168\u7403AI\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5370\u592a\u5730\u533a\u5728\u5236\u5b9a\u672a\u6765\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5efa\u7acbAI\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5168\u7403\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

If the debate about the future regulation of AI is to efficiently address the serious dangers and potentially existential risks related to AI, then it should be tied to other global governance issues, such as those summarized by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For this endeavor to be successful, the substantive questions of regulation must be combined with efforts to reform the present international system with a view to establishing a more efficient and coherent global institutional framework.

The dataset comprises quarterly observations for 12 European countries between 2003 and 2023, grouped into Northern, Central, and Southern regions. Climatic variables include mean air temperature, cooling and heating degree days, and the log-transformed price of Russian gas. Macroeconomic controls, GDP growth and fiscal balance, are incorporated to account for structural conditions. Empirical findings show that climatic factors and their regional interactions are not statistically significant determinants of services inflation. However, gas prices exert a strong inflationary effect, and inflation persistence is evident. Diagnostic tests confirm the model\u2019s validity, addressing endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, and instrument proliferation. The main contribution of this study lies in applying a robust dynamic panel framework to assess climate-inflation linkages in the under-researched services sector, highlighting the role of energy channels over direct climatic effects. By integrating regional heterogeneity and methodological rigor, the paper advances understanding of how climate variability translates into inflationary pressures within service-based economies.\u200b"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\uff08System GMM\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u6b27\u6d32\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c14\u5019\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u4ef7\u683c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u901a\u80c0\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "research_question": "\u6c14\u5019\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6b27\u6d32\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c14\u5019\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52a8\u6001\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\uff08System GMM\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6c14\u5019\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282003-2023\u5e74\u6b27\u6d3212\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u5b63\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u5317\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u5357\u4e09\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u6e29\u3001\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u4ef7\u683c\uff09\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982GDP\u589e\u957f\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u6c14\u5019\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u4ef7\u683c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u901a\u80c0\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u80c0\u5177\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u6e20\u9053\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u4ef7\u683c\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Much has been written about the concept in tax law in modern times, though perhaps less about the historical origins and development of the concept. This chapter seeks to fill a gap in the literature discussing the history of the concept, utilising as its primary method of analysis the study of historical statutes and how they evolved over time. It starts with the modern conception of beneficial ownership as a concept inextricable from the law of equity, with its core being the idea that a person has a legal duty to hold assets for the benefit of another (to the exclusion of its own benefit)."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5386\u53f2\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u8861\u5e73\u6cd5\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "research_question": "\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5bf9\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5728\u7a0e\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5386\u53f2\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u5e73\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e2a\u4eba\u6709\u4e49\u52a1\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eba\u5229\u76ca\u6301\u6709\u8d44\u4ea7\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5386\u53f2\u6cd5\u89c4\u53ca\u5176\u6f14\u53d8\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u8861\u5e73\u6cd5\u5bc6\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eba\u5229\u76ca\u6301\u6709\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e49\u52a1\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u8861\u5e73\u6cd5\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u53d7\u76ca\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5386\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Using descriptive statistics and a multi-country computable general equilibrium model (IMF-ENV), we examine how AI-driven data center growth affects electricity consumption, electricity prices, and carbon emissions. Our analysis of national accounts reveals AI-producing sectors in the U.S. have grown nearly triple the rate of the private non-farm business sector, with firm-level evidence showing electricity costs for vertically integrated AI companies nearly doubled between 2019-2023. Simulating AI scenarios in the IMF-ENV model based on projected data center power consumption up to 2030, we find the AI boom will cause manageable but varying increases in energy prices and emissions depending on policies and infrastructure constraints. Under scenarios with constrained growth in renewable energy capacity and limited expansion of transmission infrastructure, U.S. electricity prices could increase by 8.6%, while U.S. and global carbon emissions would rise by 5.5% and 1.2% respectively under current policies. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning energy policies with AI development to support this technological revolution, while mitigating environmental impacts."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u653f\u7b56\u4e0eAI\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u589e\u957f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ChatGPT\uff09\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u7535\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4f7f\u7528\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u56fd\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\uff08IMF-ENV\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d26\u6237\u5206\u6790\u548cIMF-ENV\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5e45\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u7535\u4ef7\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0a\u6da88.6%\uff0c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u589e\u52a05.5%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3aAI\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u653f\u7b56\u4e0eAI\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6280\u672f\u9769\u547d\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To tackle the adverse impact on consumers, Spain and Portugal implemented the Iberian Exception (IE) in June 2022, intending to decouple power prices from the rest of Europe to reduce consumer energy bills. Our findings suggested that IE successfully lowered the fossil fuel bids in the Iberian power market with a secondary effect of decoupling the Spanish power markets from France. We simulated the counterfactual scenario by investigating wholesale electricity prices without the subsidy paid to gas generators. Our demand and supply adjustment scenario shows that the subsidy reduced Iberian electricity day-ahead prices by 35.3%.

To tackle the adverse impact on consumers, Spain and Portugal implemented the Iberian Exception (IE) in June 2022, intending to decouple power prices from the rest of Europe to reduce consumer energy bills. Our findings suggested that IE successfully lowered the fossil fuel bids in the Iberian power market with a secondary effect of decoupling the Spanish power markets from France. We simulated the counterfactual scenario by investigating wholesale electricity prices without the subsidy paid to gas generators. Our demand and supply adjustment scenario shows that the subsidy reduced Iberian electricity day-ahead prices by 35.3%.

The Article criticizes the General Court for adopting new arguments not raised in the Commission\u2019s Final Decision and for relying on superficial similarities between Irish law and the OECD\u2019s Authorized OECD Approach (AOA) to justify using external standards. It also criticizes the Court of Justice for failing to discipline the overreach of the Commission and General Court.&nbsp; By relying on a dubious procedural technicality, the Court reinstated the Commission\u2019s recovery order despite prior decisions (Fiat, Amazon, Engie) that should have compelled rejection. Arguing that the Apple decision undermines Member State tax sovereignty, legal predictability, and the rule of law, the Article recommends reforms to improve procedural transparency, constrain retroactive enforcement, and restore coherence to EU state aid doctrine in tax cases. Such reforms are needed if state aid enforcement in the tax area is to serve as a legitimate constraint on Member State tax sovereignty."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u8bc4\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u548c\u6b27\u76df\u6cd5\u9662\u5728\u82f9\u679c\u56fd\u5bb6\u63f4\u52a9\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u672a\u6765\u7a0e\u6536\u56fd\u5bb6\u63f4\u52a9\u6267\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u548c\u6cd5\u9662\u5728\u82f9\u679c\u56fd\u5bb6\u63f4\u52a9\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u9769\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u82f9\u679c\u56fd\u5bb6\u63f4\u52a9\u6848\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u7a0e\u6536\u56fd\u5bb6\u63f4\u52a9\u6267\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u9769\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u7a0e\u6536\u4e3b\u6743\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u7a0e\u6536\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u548c\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b27\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u548c\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "findings": "\u6b27\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u865a\u6784\u7684\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6cd5\u9662\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\u6027OECD\u6307\u5357\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6267\u6cd5\u4e0d\u516c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u7a0e\u6536\u56fd\u5bb6\u63f4\u52a9\u6267\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u6539\u9769\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u9650\u5236\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u6267\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u6b27\u76df\u7a0e\u6536\u56fd\u5bb6\u63f4\u52a9\u5b66\u8bf4\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002"}}

We develop a New Keynesian DSGE model with climate externalities, disaggregated energy sectors, and differentiated pub- lic investment in green and dirty capital. The economy transitions from a high (90%) to a lower (75%) public debt-to-GDP ratio under two regimes: ad hoc fiscal rules and e optimized state-contingent policies following Schmitt-Grohe \u0301 and Uribe (2007). We analyze each regime with and without climate-related productivity effects. Our find- ings show that long-run output and welfare gains from consolidation depend on the fiscal instrument used.

Empirically, our artificial surplus consumption from aggregate consumption is high and yields small effective risk aversion.

Taking a logarithm for the surplus consumption ratio in the habit sensitivity function can resolve this inconsistency and preserve empirically plausible levels of risk aversion. Separating the stochastic discount factor curvature from its typical linear correspondence with effective risk aversion is essential in our theoretical specification.

This study measures single station throughput on Wi-Fi networks following IEEE Standards Association 802.11 standards from 802.11a to 802.11be. Its principal objective is to disentangle performance improvements enabled by wider channels from those driven by technology improvements in the Wi-Fi protocols. It contrasts resource consumption with resource consumption efficiency.<br><br>The Wireless Broadband Alliance is following this line of research in a series of Wi-Fi 7 Trials in residential and enterprise settings. <br><br>Testing reveals that the most impactful upgrade took place when 802.11n supplanted 802.11a and 802.11g. 802.11n (also known as Wi-Fi 4) doubled channel size from 20 to 40 MHz while increasing throughput by eight times. While wider channels helped, other factors proved more significant in enabling pleasing user experience. Subsequent revisions have relied almost exclusively on increasing channel size with modest improvements in the protocols. <br><br>While some amended standards managed to improve performance through a combination of spectrum and efficiency \u2013 such as 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5), others have been much less impactful. One amendment \u2013 6 GHz 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6e) actually eroded download performance in most scenarios even when improving upload performance.  The most recent amendment \u2013 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) \u2013 is quite effective at improving performance in short-distance and long-distance scenarios, but harmful at the most commonly used middle distance of 25 feet except when supplemented by Automatic Frequency Control (AFC). While Wi-Fi 7 includes a host of protocol improvements, few products implement all of them. <br><br>Policy makers would be wise to consider the tradeoff between finite spectrum resources and the effectively infinite supply of potential design improvements in the engineering pipeline when responding to requests for more spectrum.

A RI investor can attain higher expected terminal utility under rate fluctuations when signal accuracy and portfolio allocation are jointly optimized, compared to a constant-rate benchmark. Notably, a preference for a short-term bond does not necessarily imply investment, as actual allocation depends on the asset mix.As fluctuation rises, investors shift from economizing on information to sharpening precision for timely, informed responses. Retaining static signal choice at time zero and dynamic portfolio planning, our model explains the emergence of corner solutions\u2014full attention to either rate or market signals\u2014whenever the marginal utility of a hidden state exceeds its acquisition cost.Replacing the constant rate in the baseline model with a trend-based estimate yields convergence in value functions.

Rogers College of Law Legal Studies Research Paper Series", "journalId": null}]}, "paperStatus": "APPROVED", "abstract": "<p><span>Many struggles are being fought in America today around regulation and redistribution of private property rights: between owners\u2019 right to develop land and society\u2019s need for environmental conservation; between landlords\u2019 privilege to charge higher rents and society\u2019s need for affordable housing, between property owners\u2019 desire for protection from negative effects and unhoused persons\u2019 need to live in the only space accessible to them, etc. These struggles, however, are doomed by a widely shared notion that public and private are inherent qualities in a zero-sum game. This Article refutes this notion. Building upon Legal Realist, post-Realist, and poststructuralist insights, it argues that public and private are effects of publicizing and privatizing acts. They are not opponents, but accomplices that depend on each other for meaning. Property is <i>both</i> public <i>and</i> private. It is public <i>when, to the extent, and precisely because</i> it is private, and vice versa. A healthy property system must embrace the paradigmatic status of both private and public property. Recognizing the value of one but denying that of the other is to build a chair with half its legs.</span></p>\n<p><span>This Article attributes the current conflicts around property regulation and redistribution to a lack of public property paradigm in American law. To fill this gap the Article presents a public property paradigm as a companion strategy to the existing private property paradigm. The core of this public property paradigm is a general and unconditional right for everyone in America to have and enjoy essential property rights such as housing and ecological commons. The Article grounds this public property paradigm on the dual human condition of transcendence (freedom) and facticity (fixedness), drawing from phenomenology, Hegelian freedom, Vulnerability Theory, and feminist theory.</span></p>\n<p><span>This Article is radical, not so much because of the institutions it proposes, but because of how it gets there by taking a highly eclectic approach, borrowing from diametrically opposing theories of property and the human condition, and building a theoretical house that is more capacious than a pure theory would allow. The borrowed theories are compatible in this Article, but only with a heavy dose of pragmatism and a deep commitment to cultural and political pluralism.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u4e0e\u79c1\u4eba\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\u5bf9\u7acb\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u6cd5\u5f8b\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u540e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u8d22\u4ea7\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u5e94\u4eab\u6709\u4f4f\u623f\u548c\u751f\u6001\u516c\u5730\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0e\u518d\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\u51b2\u7a81\u6e90\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u8d22\u4ea7\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u516c\u5171\u4e0e\u79c1\u4eba\u8d22\u4ea7\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7acb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u540e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u3001\u9ed1\u683c\u5c14\u81ea\u7531\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5973\u6027\u4e3b\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u516c\u5171\u8d22\u4ea7\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "findings": "\u516c\u5171\u4e0e\u79c1\u4eba\u8d22\u4ea7\u662f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u7acb\uff1b\u516c\u5171\u8d22\u4ea7\u8303\u5f0f\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516c\u5171\u4e0e\u79c1\u4eba\u8d22\u4ea7\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\u51b2\u7a81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u8d22\u4ea7\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}
