For the foundational management model \"Quartet Model\" and the AI architecture proposed in prior research to function effectively, the \"quality\" of the input data is of decisive importance. While many digital transformation (DX) initiatives stop at digitizing results such as procedural manuals, this paper argues that the key to maximizing AI's potential lies in the \"thought processes\" that form the core of veteran employees' tacit knowledge. Focusing on Japanese companies facing structural issues in skill transfer, it highlights the severity of problems like individualized craftsmanship and the disruption of its succession. The paper then proposes a concrete framework for efficiently collecting and accumulating these thought processes-which have traditionally been difficult to codify-by embedding generative AI into on-the-job training (OJT) and daily operations. This approach suggests the possibility of building a new symbiotic relationship between humans and AI, evolving organizations from static machines into \"self-learning organizations,\" thereby transforming work styles in an era of population decline and enabling the visualization of new forms of corporate value, including organizational culture."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548cAI\u67b6\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u65e5\u672c\u4f01\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\u4f20\u627f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5d4c\u5165OJT\u548c\u65e5\u5e38\u8fd0\u8425\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u79ef\u7d2f\u4f20\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u673a\u5171\u751f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6253\u9020\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u79ef\u7d2f\u8d44\u6df1\u5458\u5de5\u9690\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316AI\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65e5\u672c\u4f01\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u6280\u80fd\u4f20\u627f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u5de5\u5320\u6280\u827a\u548c\u4f20\u627f\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u4ec5\u505c\u7559\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u6570\u5b57\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eQuartet Model\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548cAI\u67b6\u6784\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u673a\u5171\u751f\u548c\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u5728\u5c97\u57f9\u8bad(OJT)\u548c\u65e5\u5e38\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u79ef\u7d2f\u4f20\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "findings": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u5171\u751f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u673a\u5668\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u8f6c\u578b\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ef7\u503c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u5171\u751f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u9690\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4f20\u627f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u53e3\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u5316\u7b49\u65b0\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u65e5\u672c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e94\u5bf9\u6280\u80fd\u4f20\u627f\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Given the importance of personal traits in shaping consumer behavior and their potential contribution to personalized marketing strategies, this study investigates the effects of attachment styles (anxious and avoidant) on purchase intention, mediated by social anxiety and social presence. It exmines whether streamer type (virtual vs. human) moderates these relationships. Attachment styles were chosen as the focus due to the highly interactive and emotionally driven nature of live-streaming commerce, which is known to influence social interactions and emotional engagement. Two experimental studies reveal that both attachment avoidance and anxiety increase social anxiety, which subsequently reduces perceived social presence and purchase intention. Notably, these effects persist regardless of streamer type (virtual vs. human). The results of this work extend attachment theory to live-streaming contexts, deepen the understanding of consumer psychology in digital retailing, and offer insightful implications for live-streaming commerce practices."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u9644\u7740\u98ce\u683c\uff08\u7126\u8651\u5782\u548c\u907f\u514d\u5782\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4ea4\u7126\u8651\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u5f71\u54cd\u76f4\u64ad\u8d2d\u7269\u610f\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e3b\u64ad\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u865a\u62dfvs\u4eba\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9644\u7740\u907f\u514d\u548c\u7126\u8651\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u793e\u4ea4\u7126\u8651\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u793e\u4ea4\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u548c\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u5411\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u53d7\u4e3b\u64ad\u7c7b\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u9644\u7740\u98ce\u683c\uff08\u7126\u8651\u5782\u548c\u907f\u514d\u5782\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5728\u76f4\u64ad\u8d2d\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u5411\uff1f\u793e\u4ea4\u7126\u8651\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u8d77\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f5c\u7528\uff1f\u4e3b\u64ad\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u865a\u62dfvs\u4eba\u7c7b\uff09\u662f\u5426\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u865a\u62df\u4e3b\u64ad\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u76f4\u64ad\u8d2d\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u5c11\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8003\u5bdf\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5fc3\u7406\u7279\u8d28\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8d2d\u4e70\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e2a\u4eba\u7279\u8d28\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f62\u6210\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8425\u9500\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u56fd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u9644\u7740\u7406\u8bba\uff08Attachment Theory\uff09\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7126\u8651\u5782\u9644\u7740\u548c\u907f\u514d\u5782\u9644\u7740\u4e24\u79cd\u9644\u7740\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u793e\u4ea4\u7126\u8651\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6cd5\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9644\u7740\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u5411\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u793e\u4ea4\u7126\u8651\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u5bdf\u4e3b\u64ad\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "findings": "\u9644\u7740\u907f\u514d\u548c\u7126\u8651\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u793e\u4ea4\u7126\u8651\uff0c\u800c\u793e\u4ea4\u7126\u8651\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u793e\u4ea4\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u548c\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u865a\u62df\u4e3b\u64ad\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u64ad\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e3b\u64ad\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9644\u7740\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u76f4\u64ad\u5546\u52a1\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u96f6\u552e\u4e2d\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u9644\u7740\u98ce\u683c\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u76f4\u64ad\u5546\u52a1\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e1a\u754c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u9644\u7740\u98ce\u683c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8425\u9500\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While many modern solutions utilize advanced technologies like biometrics or RFID, they can be costly and technically complex, making them inaccessible for many institutions. This project introduces a streamlined, database-driven School Management System (SMS) designed to address these challenges by providing an affordable and scalable solution for attendance tracking. By leveraging a PostgreSQL database, the system automates attendance recording and generates real-time reports, which helps reduce administrative work and minimizes manual errors. The system's design focuses on four main user roles Admin, Teacher, Student, and Parent with customized dashboards and permissions to ensure usability and data security. A systematic literature review and various testing phases, including unit and acceptance testing, were conducted to ensure the system's reliability and efficiency. The results demonstrate that this approach offers a practical, cost-effective alternative to traditional and expensive hardwaredependent systems, contributing to improved institutional efficiency and data-driven decisionmaking in education."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePostgreSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u5b66\u6821\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8003\u52e4\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u62a5\u544a\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8003\u52e4\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5b66\u6821\u8003\u52e4\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7eb8\u8d28\u8003\u52e4\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u8d39\u7528\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7eb8\u8d28\u8003\u52e4\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u6613\u9519\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u6b3a\u8bc8\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u6216RFID\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u8ba9\u8bb8\u591a\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u627f\u53d7\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u9650\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PostgreSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u6237\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u3001\u6559\u5e08\u3001\u5b66\u751f\u3001\u5bb6\u957f\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "findings": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u884c\u653f\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u624b\u5de5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4fe1\u606f\u5316\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6559\u80b2\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u5b66\u6821\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8003\u52e4\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u6784\u8fd0\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

The key issue in applying cloud computing to passenger service systems lies in enhancing the security and reliability of containers within cloud computing environments. Since passenger service systems operate in open network environments, they are exposed to numerous security vulnerabilities and malicious cyber-attacks, potentially leading to system crashes or the leakage of critical data. To mitigate the severe impacts of such attacks, effective container security isolation policies must be implemented. Firstly, a multi-level container security isolation model is proposed, along with the design of rules for configuring model security policies. Subsequently, a static game model is utilized to dynamically adjust optimal security strategies. By integrating the wolf pack algorithm with the co-evolution algorithm, a wolf pack-co-evolution algorithm is devised to ascertain the optimal solution for the static game, thereby determining the optimal security strategy. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate that the wolf pack-co-evolution algorithm can effectively solve for the Nash equilibrium in the multi-level container security isolation static game model, enabling dynamic adjustments to be made to security strategies. This approach ensures the security of both container subjects and objects while enhancing container computing efficiency."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u72fc\u7fa4\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u9694\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6700\u4f18\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bb9\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f68\u9053\u4ea4\u901a\u5ba2\u8fd0\u670d\u52a1\u538b\u529b\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e91\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5ba2\u8fd0\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u653e\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u9694\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9759\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u7f6e\u89c4\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u9694\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u7f6e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u72fc\u7fa4-\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u535a\u5f08\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "findings": "\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u72fc\u7fa4-\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u591a\u5c42\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u9694\u79bb\u9759\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u72fc\u7fa4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u9694\u79bb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5bb9\u5668\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u5ba2\u4f53\u7684\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bb9\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u4ea4\u901a\u5ba2\u8fd0\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Using fluidity as a measure of these threats, our analysis shows that product market threats significantly increase firms' reliance on leases. This effect is more pronounced for firms with greater financial constraints, cash-flow volatility, predation and obsolescence risk, information asymmetries, and weak corporate governance. We also show that the economic benefits of leasing to counter competitive threats are substantial and diverse, including capturing growth, maintaining profitability, and mitigating inefficient capital allocation.

I exploit the timing of migrant busing from the southern border as an exogenous source of variation in a difference-in-differences specification. I find that an additional 100 migrant shelter hotel rooms (per 100k Hispanics) are associated with 1.11 more Hispanic arrests (per 100k Hispanics) at the modified zip code-by-week level. Hypergranular estimates from a linear probability model reveal that arrestees within 500 meters of a migrant hotel are 1.9 percentage points (5.5% relative to the overall mean) more likely to be Hispanic in the post-treatment period.

Using clinical and administrative data from 734,319 admissions across 20 hospitals between January 2018 and August 2021, we apply bootstrapped Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to operationalize three wellestablished measures of hospital performance: clinical efficiency, technical efficiency, and patient experience. DEA inputs reflect hospital capacity and resource levels, while outputs capture effectiveness across key service dimensions. We use the DEA scores as dependent variables in a Regression Discontinuity in Time model to estimate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in an Interrupted Time Series analysis to assess long-term trends. Results indicate a sharp decline in all three efficiency metrics at the onset of the pandemic, with sustained negative effects. Multiple robustness checks confirm the consistency of these findings. To disentangle operational drivers from changes in patient acuity, we use Structural Equation Modeling to estimate the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on outcomes such as hospital length-of-stay, mortality, ICU priority, and discharge destination. This is complemented by interviews with senior health leaders. Our findings identify a range of challenges and detail the operational changes hospitals adopted in response. Results show that changes to health outcomes appear to be as strongly associated with operational adjustments as to the direct effect of the pandemic. The analysis highlights opportunities for better coordination and broader sharing of best practices. Together, our results offer evidence-based recommendations to enhance hospital resilience and preparedness for future health crises."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5305\u7ed5\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86COVID-19\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5bf9\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u5b89\u5927\u7565\u7701\u533b\u9662\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u75c5\u6bd2\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u8c03\u6574\u90fd\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u7ed3\u679c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u533b\u9662\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u5907\u5ea6\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "COVID-19\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5bf9\u533b\u9662\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u548c\u75c5\u4eba\u4f53\u9a8c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f\u8fd0\u8425\u8c03\u6574\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u75c5\u6bd2\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f5c\u7528\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3COVID-19\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u672a\u6765\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5371\u673a\u5e94\u5bf9\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u75c5\u6bd2\u76f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u533b\u9662\u8fd0\u8425\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5305\u7ed5\u5206\u6790(DEA)\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65ad\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u56de\u5f52(RDiT)\u548c\u65ad\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217(ITS)\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b(SEM)\u6765\u89e3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u752820\u5bb6\u533b\u96622018\u5e741\u6708\u81f32021\u5e748\u6708\u671f\u95f4734,319\u4f8b\u5165\u9662\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5305\u7ed5\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6280\u672f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u75c5\u4eba\u4f53\u9a8c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u65ad\u70b9\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u65ad\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u75ab\u60c5\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u79bb\u75c5\u4eba\u60a3\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "findings": "\u75ab\u60c5\u7206\u53d1\u540e\u6240\u6709\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u90fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5c3d\u5934\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u6076\u5316\uff1b\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u533b\u9662\u8fd0\u8425\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4e0d\u5f31\u4e8e\u75c5\u6bd2\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8c03\u67e5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u8425\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6848\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u75c5\u6bd2\u76f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8c03\u6574\u95f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u7ba1\u7406\u5b66\u5728\u5371\u673a\u54cd\u5e94\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u533b\u9662\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6311\u6218\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u5206\u4eab\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u533b\u9662\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5371\u673a\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u5907\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The growth in smartphone ownership and social media usage has the potential to alleviate these barriers. Informed by a dynamic model of relational contracting, we run a field experiment leveraging these technological tools to provide exogenous variation in (1) search frictions and (2) trust frictions (adverse selection and moral hazard) in a large international import market. In the search treatment, we connect a randomly selected 80% of 1,862 small garment firms in Senegal to new suppliers in T\u00fcrkiye. We then cross-randomize two trust treatments that provide additional information about the types (adverse selection) and incentives (moral hazard) of these new suppliers. Reducing search frictions is sufficient to increase access to foreign markets: in all treated groups, firms are 26% more likely to have the varieties a mystery shopper requests, and the goods sold are 30% more likely to be high quality. However, the trust treatments are necessary for longer-term effects: using both transaction-level mobile payments data and a follow-up survey, we show that these groups are significantly more likely to develop the connections into relationships that persist beyond the endline survey. These new relationships lead to increases in medium-run profit and sales. Finally, we use the treatment effects to estimate the model and counterfactually lower the trust frictions among the whole supplier pool for a given firm, finding that the largest gains come from alleviating adverse selection."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u969c\u788d\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u585e\u5185\u52a0\u5c0f\u578b\u670d\u88c5\u4f01\u4e1a\u83b7\u5f97\u56fd\u5916\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u4efb\u969c\u788d\u624d\u80fd\u5efa\u7acb\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "research_question": "\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ece\u56fd\u9645\u5e02\u573a\u8d2d\u4e70\u8f93\u5165\u54c1\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u969c\u788d\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u969c\u788d\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u969c\u788d\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u969c\u788d\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u56fd\u9645\u5e02\u573a\u8d2d\u4e70\u8f93\u5165\u54c1\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u969c\u788d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u9006\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u4fe1\u4efb\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u585e\u5185\u52a0\u5bf91,862\u5bb6\u5c0f\u578b\u670d\u88c5\u4f01\u4e1a\u8fdb\u884c\u5730\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e980%\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e0e\u571f\u8033\u5176\u65b0\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5efa\u7acb\u8054\u7cfb\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u969c\u788d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea4\u53c9\u968f\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u4efb\u969c\u788d\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u969c\u788d\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u83b7\u5f97\u56fd\u5916\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff08+26%\uff09\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff08+30%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u4efb\u969c\u788d\u624d\u80fd\u5efa\u7acb\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u9500\u552e\u548c\u5229\u6da6\u589e\u957f\u3002\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u5408\u7ea6\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u969c\u788d\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u969c\u788d\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u672f\u8fde\u63a5\u56fd\u9645\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u6027\u3002"}}

Loper Bright, which overruled the Chevron decision from 1984, tells us that a court should determine the meaning of all statutory provisions for itself \u2014 rather than deferring to the views of the federal agencies that implement those provisions. This Article grapples with the effect of the decision at FDA \u2014 one of the most important federal agencies, affecting the life of every person in the United States and regulating about a quarter of all consumer spending in the country, i.e., over $4 trillion annually. It makes three novel and potentially surprising claims, as follows.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n First, the Chevron doctrine meant less to FDA than conventional wisdom supposes. Empirical studies of litigation during the Chevron years \u2014 one published by the author and one published by a different team \u2014 show that FDA often lost cases at \u201cstep one\u201d of Chevron, after reviewing courts decided the agency\u2019s statute clearly answered the question differently than the agency had. This Article also offers the first review of litigation against FDA in the decade before Chevron, finding that the agency generally prevailed in cases involving statutory interpretation even without Chevron in play. Indeed, with one possible exception, no case would have clearly come out differently after Chevron, i.e., none that FDA lost and that it unquestionably would have won after 1984.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Second, if Loper Bright and the formalist principles ascendant in the judiciary are understood properly, FDA should now win many cases that it would have won previously on the basis of Chevron deference. But the reasoning will be different. In many of these instances, the agency was not really interpreting its statute. Instead, it was engaged in policymaking.&nbsp;<span>If FDA policymaking was authorized by Congress, judicial review \u2014 even after Loper Bright \u2014 remains deferential. Thus, some territory that agency defenders fear was lost with elimination of the Chevron framework will be regained if the agency persuades courts of its statutory authority to make discretionary calls. Scouring FDA\u2019s statute for evidence of this authorization has not been a priority in the past, but this Article shows that the search may be surprisingly fruitful.</span>\n</div>\n<div>\n <div>\n  Finally, de novo review may yield new and surprising results, but not in the cases that people expect. The defeats should not stem from judicial interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions as to which those courts would previously have deferred to FDA. Again, many of those agency actions should today be understood as policymaking. Instead, the surprises will come when courts review actual interpretations that have not been challenged previously. Some of FDA\u2019s statutory interpretations are half a century old, or older, and experts in the field have simply internalized them, without realizing that federal judges coming to the issues cold will see things very differently. That said, regulated parties may decline to upset the apple cart.

While housing inequality research often centres on affordability, supply, and physical adequacy, these measures could overlook structural and powerbased mechanisms of inequality. Drawing on 13 in-depth interviews with migrant tenants and three with housing support practitioners, the study identifies four such mechanisms: informational asymmetry, inequities embedded in housing systems, discriminatory rental practices, and employerdominated housing arrangements. Using the capability approach, these are conceptualised as conversion factors that limit the transformation of financial resources into real opportunities to reside in ways they have reason to value. By grounding its analysis in lived experiences, the study makes the recognitional and power dimensions of housing justice more tangible and policy-relevant, offering empirically anchored concepts that can guide actionable agendas. The study contributes to advancing housing justice debates by demonstrating the need for extending the policy focus from distributing dwellings and subsidies to ensuring meaningful opportunities to adequate housing."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u719f\u7ec3\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u4f4f\u623f\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u4f4f\u623f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u79df\u8d41\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u96c7\u4e3b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f4f\u623f\u5b89\u6392\u56db\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u5206\u914d\u4f4f\u623f\u8f6c\u5411\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u673a\u4f1a\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u719f\u7ec3\u79fb\u6c11\u4e3a\u4f55\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u969c\u788d\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u969c\u788d\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4f\u623f\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u6027\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u548c\u7269\u7406\u9002\u5b9c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u6743\u529b\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u79fb\u6c11\u4f4f\u623f\u969c\u788d\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08capability approach\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4f\u623f\u969c\u788d\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u9650\u5236\u8d22\u52a1\u8d44\u6e90\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u4f4f\u623f\u673a\u4f1a\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec13\u4e2a\u79fb\u6c11\u79df\u6237\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c3\u4e2a\u4f4f\u623f\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "findings": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u969c\u788d\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u4f4f\u623f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u5d4c\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u79df\u8d41\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u96c7\u4e3b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u5b89\u6392\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4f4f\u623f\u969c\u788d\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f4f\u623f\u6b63\u4e49\u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\u6027\u548c\u6743\u529b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u66f4\u52a0\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u5206\u914d\u4f4f\u623f\u548c\u8865\u8d34\u8f6c\u5411\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

Using mental health data from the German SocioEconomic Panel (SOEP) as a proxy for affective states, we show that better mental health significantly increases the likelihood of stock ownership, while symptoms of depression and chronic worry reduce participation. Our estimates suggest that a one-standarddeviation improvement in overall mental health translates to approximately 120,000 stock market entering households annually in Germany. To address endogeneity, we exploit the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment using a Difference-inDifferences Instrumental Variables (DiD-IV) approach. We find that individuals with weaker pre-crisis social networks experienced larger declines in mental health during the pandemic and are significantly less likely to become stockholders than those with stronger social ties. Conceptually, we identify three channels through which mental health affects financial decision-making: external beliefs (expectations about returns), internal beliefs (perceived capability to invest), and preferences (risk tolerance)."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5bb6\u5ead\u80a1\u5e02\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u6539\u5584\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u7ea612\u4e07\u5fb7\u56fd\u5bb6\u5ead\u8fdb\u5165\u80a1\u5e02\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4e09\u4e2a\u6e20\u9053\u5f71\u54cd\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56", "research_question": "\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5bb6\u5ead\u80a1\u5e02\u53c2\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u80a1\u5e02\u53c2\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a", "theoretical_framework": "\u884c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6e20\u9053\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff08\u6536\u76ca\u9884\u671f\uff09\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff08\u6295\u8d44\u80fd\u529b\u611f\u77e5\uff09\u548c\u504f\u597d\uff08\u98ce\u9669\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\uff09", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fb7\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9762\u677f\uff08SOEP\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\uff08DiD-IV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528COVID-19\u75ab\u60c5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u751f\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "findings": "\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u6301\u80a1\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6291\u90c1\u548c\u6162\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7\u75c7\u72b6\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff1b\u75ab\u60c5\u4e2d\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u8f83\u5f31\u8005\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u80a1\u4e1c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u66f4\u4f4e", "theory_contributions": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5f71\u54cd\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u5584\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u80a1\u5e02\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e74\u5747\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u7ea612\u4e07\u5fb7\u56fd\u5bb6\u5ead\u8fdb\u5165\u80a1\u5e02"}}

To this end, we assess the impact of the exchange rate on inflation (ERPT) by distinguishing between countries with a fixed exchange rate regime (WAEMU and Cavbo Verde) and countries with a flexible exchange rate regime (WAMZ). Applying the ARDL panel model, the results obtained from estimating the ERPT show an incomplete pass-through effect for the ECOWAS countries, the UEMOA and Cabo-Verde countries and for the WAMZ countries. For fixed exchange rate countries, the exchange rate pass-through is positive and significant in the short term. In fact, a real appreciation of the exchange rate of 1% leads to an increase in the price level in the WAEMU and Cape Verde of 0.20% in the short term and 0.16% in the long term, which is not significant. For countries with a flexible exchange rate, the significant effect of the pass-through is noted in the short and long term. A 1% loss of competitiveness leads to inflation of 0.13% in the short term and disinflation of 0.8% in the long term."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u897f\u975e\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5171\u540c\u4f53\uff08ECOWAS\uff09\u4e2d\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u5ea6\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u6c47\u7387\u4f20\u9012\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fa\u5b9a\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u6c47\u7387\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u800c\u6d6e\u52a8\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u5ea6\u7c7b\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u897f\u975e\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5171\u540c\u4f53\uff08ECOWAS\uff09\u7684\u6c47\u7387\u4f20\u9012\u6548\u5e94\uff08ERPT\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6c47\u7387\u53d8\u52a8\u5bf9\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3aECOWAS\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6c47\u7387\u4f20\u9012\u7406\u8bba\uff08Exchange Rate Pass-Through, ERPT\uff09\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u56fa\u5b9a\u6c47\u7387\u5236\uff08WAEMU\u548c\u4f5b\u5f97\u89d2\uff09\u4e0e\u6d6e\u52a8\u6c47\u7387\u5236\uff08WAMZ\uff09\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528ARDL\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u5ea6\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6c47\u7387\u4f20\u9012\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "findings": "1\uff09ECOWAS\u56fd\u5bb6\u6574\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6c47\u7387\u4f20\u9012\uff1b2\uff09\u56fa\u5b9a\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u56fd\u5bb6\u77ed\u671f\u6c47\u7387\u4f20\u9012\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\uff081%\u5b9e\u9645\u5347\u503c\u5bfc\u81f40.20%\u901a\u80c0\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u6d6e\u52a8\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u56fd\u5bb6\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff081%\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u635f\u5931\u5bfc\u81f40.13%\u901a\u80c0\u548c0.8%\u901a\u7f29\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6c47\u7387\u4f20\u9012\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u6d32\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u4f20\u9012\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3aECOWAS\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6c47\u7387\u5236\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Using the 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2021 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we estimate effects with difference-in-differences designs that combine matching and entropy-balancing weights, and we apply difference-in-differences causal forests to characterize treatment-effect heterogeneity. The adverse effects observed before COVID-19 \u2014a 1.2-1.7 month reduction in employment and a 0.7-0.8 log-point decline in earnings\u2014are no longer evident after COVID-19, with post-COVID estimates being small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Heterogeneity analyses based on O*NET-derived skill indices (cognitive, interpersonal, manual) show that negative effects on employment, DI receipt, and monthly earnings increase with age and are attenuated for workers in cognitively or interpersonally demanding occupations. We find no evidence that health shocks lead to shifts toward less-manual occupations or increased enrollment in education or training. Occupational and industry switching rose after COVID-19 for all workers, with smaller differences between those experiencing health shocks and others, consistent with a more flexible post-pandemic labor market."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e862014-2023\u5e74\u95f4\u5065\u5eb7\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u52b3\u52a8\u8005\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u6536\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0COVID-19\u524d\u540e\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u540e\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u56e0\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "\u5065\u5eb7\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7f8e\u56fd\u52b3\u52a8\u8005\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u679c\uff1fCOVID-19\u524d\u540e\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f\u4e0d\u540c\u804c\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u8bae\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728COVID-19\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u540e\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u73af\u5883\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5065\u5eb7\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ee5\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u804c\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282014\u30012018\u30012020\u548c2021\u5e74SIPP\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5339\u914d\u6cd5\u548c\u71b5\u8d28\u5e73\u8861\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u68ee\u6797\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "findings": "1\uff09COVID-19\u524d\u5065\u5eb7\u51b2\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c31\u4e1a\u51cf\u5c111.2-1.7\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u6536\u5165\u4e0b\u964d0.7-0.8\u5bf9\u6570\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b2\uff09COVID-19\u540e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u5931\uff1b3\uff09\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u6216\u4eba\u9645\u6280\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u51cf\u5f31\uff1b4\uff09\u65e0\u8bc1\u636e\u663e\u793a\u5065\u5eb7\u51b2\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u804c\u4e1a\u8f6c\u5411\u6216\u6559\u80b2\u57f9\u8bad\u589e\u52a0\uff1b5\uff09\u75be\u75c5\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u540e\u6240\u6709\u52b3\u52a8\u8005\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u5207\u6362\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5065\u5eb7\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u51b2\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\u7c7b\u578b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u5173\u5065\u5eb7\u51b2\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u540e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4fdd\u969c\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u653f\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In many low- and middle-income countries, the uncontrolled use of veterinary antibiotics in agriculture particularly in poultry farming has led to widespread contamination of ecosystems through untreated manure application. This study assessed the levels of antibiotic residues in poultry waste used as manure and their impact on microbial resistance and ecological risk in selected agricultural sites across Ghana. LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed high concentrations of ampicillin, tetracycline, neomycin sulfate, and sulfamethoxazole (6,025.4\u20138,460.4\u202f\u00b5g/kg), while ecological risk assessments indicated a low-to-medium risk for species from tetracycline residues. Surveys with vegetable farmers highlighted limited awareness of antibiotic contamination and its risks. Bacteriological profiling showed total viable counts ranging from 2.5 \u00d7 105 to 4.1 \u00d7 1011 CFU/mL, with Escherichia coli detected in all samples. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that 92% of bacterial isolates were resistant to ticarcillin\u2013clavulanic acid and norfloxacin, while susceptibility to amikacin remained high.

The study examined the impact of human capital development on U5MR in South Africa using time series data spanning from 1994 to 2023. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method was utilised to investigate the longrun correlation between U5MR and explanatory variables, namely female literacy(FL), health access and quality(HAQ), child immunization rate (CIR), access to improved sanitation and clean water (ISW) and prevalence of HIV/AIDS (POH) in South Africa. The analysis reveals that FL, HAQ and CIR have an insignificant correlation with U5MR. Furthermore, the analysis shows that there exists a positive correlation between ISW and U5MR and a negative correlation between POH and U5MR in the nation. This study, therefore, recommends the \"start before conception and continue through the postpartum period\" strategies by the health facilities to reduce under-5 mortality in local and international contexts."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5357\u975e\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf95\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5973\u6027\u8bed\u6587\u8bc6\u5b57\u7387\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u5b9c\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7387\u4e0eU5MR\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u6539\u5584\u73af\u5883\u536b\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0eU5MR\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u666e\u53ca\u7387\u4e0eU5MR\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173", "research_question": "\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9\u5357\u975e5\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5357\u975e\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u6307\u6570\u8f83\u4f4e(0.4)\uff0c5\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u57282020-2022\u5e74\u95f4\u4ece29\u5347\u81f340\u6b7b\u4ea1/\u5343\u4eba\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9\u6b64\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "theoretical_framework": "\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\u5173\u8054\u6027", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281994-2023\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u666e\u901a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5(OLS)\u5206\u6790\u957f\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u91cf\u5305\u62ec\u5973\u6027\u8bed\u6587\u8bc6\u5b57\u7387\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u513f\u7ae5\u5b9c\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7387\u3001\u6539\u5584\u73af\u5883\u536b\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u666e\u53ca\u7387", "findings": "\u5973\u6027\u8bed\u6587\u8bc6\u5b57\u7387\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u5b9c\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7387\u4e0eU5MR\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u6539\u5584\u73af\u5883\u536b\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0eU5MR\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u666e\u53ca\u7387\u4e0eU5MR\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173", "theory_contributions": "\u5bf9\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5357\u975e\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u5f0f", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\"\u5982\u5b55\u524d\u5f00\u59cb\u5e76\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u4ea7\u540e\u671f\"\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e\u5357\u975e\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u653b\u7565"}}

I find that the effect of common ownership on a firm\u2019s collusive behavior is more pronounced when private firms possess a relatively smaller market share. Exploiting the BlackRock-Barclays Global Investors merger as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the variations in common ownership, I find robust evidence supporting this key finding. Moreover, the effects are stronger in product categories with a lower elasticity of substitution or less fragmented market presence of private firms.

We develop the Firm-level Accounting data-based Machine Learning (<i>FAML</i>) framework, which applies machine learning algorithms directly to firm-level corporate financial reports to nowcast aggregate economic output. Unlike \"aggregate-then-nowcast\" approaches, which average firm-level variables into market or sector aggregates, or \"factor-then-nowcast\" methods, which extract common factors via dynamic factor models, our&nbsp;<i>FAML</i>&nbsp;method operates on the full set of firm-level accounting variables, retaining the informational detail embedded in firm-level heterogeneity and cross-firm interactions while minimizing information loss.

Water demand has been increasing significantly in most cities due to population growth and other factors. As a result, town water utilities are struggling to provide customers with adequate and reliable water supply service in spite of obstacles which hinder water utilities not to provide the required service. This study assesses the performance of Alem Gena town water supply sub-system based on main performance indicators namely Demand and supply, water loss, water quality, customers satisfaction and operation and maintenance. These indicators have been cited the main factors which reflect the performance of many urban water supply systems. Highwater loss, customer complaints and operation and maintenance problems indicate that there are deficiencies on the quality of the service. To conduct this research, data of water production and consumption, water supply system data were obtained from the water utility records, other data not found in the water utility records is collected using instruments. Hydraulic performance of the system is also evaluated by modeling the system. Water quality tests were conducted and compared with the national and international standards. Household interviews were made to understand customers\u2019 satisfaction towards the water supply. The result shows that water loss is 37.38% higher than the generally accepted value of 25%. There is a frequent interruption of boreholes. The water quality test shows some parameters departed from the standard set on the Ethiopian and WHO water quality guidelines. In addition, there is customer\u2019s complaint towards continuous access of water. The operation and maintenance in the town is identified to be poor. In conclusion, the town\u2019s water supply system is poor in managing water loss, water quality, operation and maintenance with the worst condition of continuous generation of water from sources continuously without interruption. It is recommended that the water utility develop a strategy and work hard on the indicated system deficiencies especially on operation and maintenance to improve the water supply system performance and provide customers with good quality service.&nbsp;</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9aAlem Gena\u9547\u4f9b\u6c34\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c34\u635f\u5931\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe37.38%\uff08\u8d85\u8fc725%\u7684\u516c\u8ba4\u6807\u51c6\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u4e95\u5b54\u4e2d\u65ad\u3001\u6c34\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u6295\u8bc9\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd0\u7ef4\u7ba1\u7406\u8584\u5f31\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "Alem Gena\u9547\u4f9b\u6c34\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u4e3b\u8981\u5b58\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u57ce\u5e02\u4f9b\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u4f9b\u6c34\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u56e0\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f9b\u6c34\u4f01\u4e1a\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5145\u8db3\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u4f9b\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f9b\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6c34\u635f\u5931\u3001\u6c34\u8d28\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u7ef4\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u4f9b\u6c34\u4f01\u4e1a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4eea\u5668\u6536\u96c6\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6c34\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u6c34\u8d28\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e76\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bb6\u5ead\u8bbf\u8c08\u4e86\u89e3\u5ba2\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002", "findings": "\u6c34\u635f\u5931\u738737.38%\u8fdc\u8d8525%\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u4e95\u5b54\u9891\u7e41\u4e2d\u65ad\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u6c34\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u548cWHO\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u5ba2\u6237\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u4f9b\u6c34\u6709\u6295\u8bc9\uff1b\u8fd0\u7ef4\u7ba1\u7406\u72b6\u51b5\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u57ce\u5e02\u4f9b\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f9b\u6c34\u4f01\u4e1a\u5236\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u91cd\u70b9\u6539\u5584\u8fd0\u7ef4\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f9b\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This paper presents what barriers constrain migrants' real opportunities-capabilities-to realise their right to adequate housing, with the case of marriage migrants in South Korea. Drawing on 15 in-depth interviews and co-produced with a grassroots migrant women's organisation, we identify two major categories of barriers: informational barriers that limit migrants' opportunities to access and act on housing-related knowledge, and institutional barriers to belonging, rooted in exclusionary assumptions about citizenship, family norms, and gendered roles. Both barriers reflect deeper structural inequalities shaped by intersecting forces of nationalism, racism, sexism, and familism. The findings contribute to housing justice discourse by highlighting the need to engage more fully with issues of relational inequality and recognition, beyond the distributive concerns around housing availability, affordability and spatial segregation. The study also illustrates how a capability-oriented analytical focus brings these dimensions to the forefront, offering a more human right-based lens on housing inequality and justice."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u97e9\u56fd\u5a5a\u59fb\u79fb\u6c11\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9002\u5b9c\u4f4f\u623f\u6743\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u969c\u788d\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u4ec0\u4e48\u969c\u788d\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u79fb\u6c11\u5b9e\u73b0\u9002\u5b9c\u4f4f\u623f\u6743\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u673a\u4f1a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u9002\u5b9c\u4f4f\u623f\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u6743\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u58f0\u7eb3\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8fd9\u4e00\u6743\u5229\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff08capability approach\uff09\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u673a\u4f1a\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e15\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u5c42\u79fb\u6c11\u5987\u5973\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5408\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "findings": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u7c7b\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u969c\u788d\uff08\u9650\u5236\u79fb\u6c11\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5229\u7528\u4f4f\u623f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff09\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u969c\u788d\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u6392\u5916\u6027\u516c\u6c11\u89c2\u5ff5\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6027\u522b\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5f52\u5c5e\u969c\u788d\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f4f\u623f\u6b63\u4e49\u8ba8\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u8ba4\u53ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5206\u914d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u529b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4f\u623f\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u6b63\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u6743\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

To support the research community, many publishers have introduced Journal Finder services. This study evaluates the performance of selected Journal Finder platforms by using a predefined set of keywords from the information technology and data science domain to determine which service provides the most suitable journal recommendations. The chosen thematic focus, \"distributed incremental clustering,\" belongs to broader fields such as machine learning, data mining, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering. Consequently, the findings are expected to benefit researchers working within this specific domain and related disciplines by offering a targeted list of relevant journals and their associated publication details, enabling quicker and more informed journal selection. The analysis demonstrates how Journal Finder tools can be used effectively by researchers who possess a preliminary article title, an abstract draft, and a set of keywords. In this context, we propose the term JournoMetrics to describe a consolidated approach for evaluating and comparing these services. Such a framework not only supports the identification of suitable journals but also addresses factors such as review&nbsp;timelines, acceptance rates, and thematic relevance, which are often decisive in journal selection."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u671f\u520a\u627e\u5230\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u671f\u520a\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faJournoMetrics\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7ed3\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "research_question": "\u54ea\u4e2a\u671f\u520a\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u53f0\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u671f\u520a\u63a8\u8350\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u6559\u5e08\u3001\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u8005\u548c\u672c\u79d1/\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5927\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u6784\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u51fa\u7248\u5546\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u671f\u520a\u627e\u5230\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u520a\u627e\u5230\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51faJournoMetrics\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7ed3\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u671f\u520a\u63a8\u8350\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u96c6\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\"\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u589e\u91cf\u805a\u7c7b\"\u4e3b\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u671f\u520a\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u671f\u520a\u627e\u5230\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u671f\u520a\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u51fa\u7248\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51faJournoMetrics\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u671f\u520a\u627e\u5230\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5ba1\u6838\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u3001\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u671f\u520a\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5408\u7684\u53d1\u8868\u671f\u520a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7814\u7a76\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This measure is obtained from online resumes of 16 million employees and a network estimation technique that allows us to identify hierarchical layers. Equipped with this measure, we document several facts about corporate hierarchies. Firms have on average ten hierarchical layers and a pyramidal organizational structure. More hierarchical firms have a more educated workforce, higher internal promotion rates, and longer employee tenure. Their operating performance is higher, but they face higher administrative costs. They are more active acquirers and produce more patents, but not higher-quality patents. They exhibit lower stock return volatility and more stable cash flows.

This paper introduces a humanistic paradigm of borderless talent management-one that recognises the intricate interplay between culture, faith, and woundedness. Drawing on insights from intercultural leadership, trauma-informed organisational theory, and ethical inclusivity, the study argues that sustainable leadership in the 21 st century must transcend geographic, spiritual, and psychological barriers. The paper explores how historical traumas, inherited biases, and unacknowledged narratives continue to shape individual and collective potential. Ultimately, it proposes a model of leadership rooted not merely in tolerance, but in sacred stewardship, empathetic resonance, and the art of leading with presence. This inquiry is both a challenge and an invitation to leaders, educators, and institutions to see talent not as a resource to extract, but as a soul to honour."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u6587\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u65e0\u8fb9\u754c\u4eba\u624d\u7ba1\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u91cd\u89c6\u6587\u5316\u3001\u4fe1\u4ef0\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u4f24\u75d5\u5bf9\u4eba\u624d\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u5723\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u5171\u9e23\u548c\u5728\u573a\u9886\u5bfc\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5316\u4e0e\u5206\u88c2\u5e76\u5b58\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8d8a\u8d8a\u5730\u7406\u3001\u7075\u6027\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u969c\u788d\u7684\u4eba\u6587\u4e3b\u4e49\u4eba\u624d\u7ba1\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u624d\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u5f53\u4eca\u4e92\u8054\u4e92\u901a\u4f46\u5206\u88c2\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5df2\u4e0d\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u6587\u5316\u3001\u4fe1\u4ef0\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u4f24\u75d5\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u4eba\u624d\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u3001\u521b\u4f24\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u9053\u5fb7\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a2\u8ba8\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5386\u53f2\u4f24\u75d5\u3001\u9057\u4f20\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u672a\u88ab\u627f\u8ba4\u7684\u53f2\u8ff0\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u6f5c\u80fd\u3002", "findings": "\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u768421\u4e16\u7eaa\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u9700\u8981\u8d8a\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u795e\u5723\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u5171\u9e23\u548c\u5728\u573a\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u6587\u4e3b\u4e49\u4eba\u624d\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u624d\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u3001\u521b\u4f24\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u4eba\u624d\u89c6\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u5c0a\u91cd\u7684\u7075\u9b42\u800c\u975e\u53ea\u662f\u63d0\u53d6\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5305\u5bb9\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While opt-out policies often increase compliance, they are also associated with managerial issues such as ethical considerations, legal regulations, limited public support, and increased no-show rates. This research demonstrates that choice architects can also establish presumed consent through the language they use, holding the opt-in policy constant. Seven studies in various health domains indicate that presumed-consent language (e.g., \u201ca vaccine was arranged for you\u201d), rather than explicit-consent language (e.g., \u201cyou can choose to get a vaccine\u201d), increases persuasion (i.e., behavioral intentions and actual behaviors). This effect occurs through perceived endorsement: Decision-makers infer through the presumed-consent language that the desired health behavior (e.g., vaccination) is the recommended course of action. Furthermore, this research examines the proposed endorsement process under various conditions. When product tangibility is low (e.g., a flu shot), the effectiveness of presumed-consent language stems primarily from perceived endorsement rather than psychological ownership or perceived ease. In contrast, when product tangibility is high (e.g., a sunscreen lotion), the effect stems primarily from psychological ownership rather than perceived endorsement or perceived ease.</span>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u63a8\u5b9a\u540c\u610f\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\"\u4e3a\u60a8\u5b89\u6392\u4e86\u75ab\u82d7\"\uff09\u800c\u975e\u660e\u786e\u540c\u610f\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\"\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\"\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u52a0\u5165\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bf4\u670d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u679c\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u8ba4\u53ef\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea7\u54c1\u6709\u5f62\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "research_question": "\u9009\u62e9\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u5efa\u7acb\u63a8\u5b9a\u540c\u610f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u9009\u62e9\u9000\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5408\u89c4\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u516c\u4f17\u652f\u6301\u5ea6\u4f4e\u548c\u7f3a\u5e2d\u7387\u9ad8\u7b49\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u52a0\u5165\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bf4\u670d\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u67b6\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u63a8\u5b9a\u540c\u610f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e03\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u5411\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u611f\u77e5\u8ba4\u53ef\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u6240\u6709\u6743\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6613\u7528\u6027\u7b49\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "\u63a8\u5b9a\u540c\u610f\u8bed\u8a00\u6bd4\u660e\u786e\u540c\u610f\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bf4\u670d\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u4f4e\u6709\u5f62\u6027\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u8ba4\u53ef\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9ad8\u6709\u5f62\u6027\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u6240\u6709\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u5efa\u7acb\u63a8\u5b9a\u540c\u610f\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u67b6\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea7\u54c1\u7279\u6027\u4e0b\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u9009\u62e9\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The model replaces individual collateral enforcement with a framework of systemic haircuts and proportional adjustments, eliminating the need for forced liquidations and allowing functional liquidity to be maintained even in the face of partial deterioration of underlying assets. The architecture redefines stablecoins as an endogenous, mutualized cash-forcollateral swap, in which issued tokens represent continuous access rights to the collective value of the buffer rather than ownership claims over specific assets. This creates a parallel infrastructure that acts as a pressure-release valve for dealer and other intermediary balance sheets, easing stress in repo markets, FX swaps, and crosscurrency swaps, and reducing the risk of market dislocations during periods of tension. The system is inclusive and neutral: it enables participants across multiple jurisdictions-including those without access to central bank reserves or swap lines-to post eligible collateral and receive liquidity in the form of tokens, without reliance on political agreements. It is also compatible with the integration of private credit markets, DLT infrastructures, and real asset tokenization processes, thereby facilitating interoperability with the traditional financial system."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u4e92\u52a9\u5316\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u62b5\u62bc\u7f13\u51b2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u5168\u7403\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f2a\u5f3a\u5236\u6e05\u7b97\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u6784\u5efa\u4e92\u52a9\u5316\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u62b5\u62bc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u538b\u529b\u671f\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u5236\u6e05\u7b97\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u5931\u8c03\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u8bbf\u95ee\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u95f4\u969c\u548c\u5730\u57df\u9650\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u91d1\u878d\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u8d44\u4ea7\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u606f\u7ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u4e92\u52a9\u5316\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u62b5\u62bc\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u51cf\u503c\u548c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6d88\u9664\u5f3a\u5236\u6e05\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u5546\u548c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5e02\u573a\u5931\u8c03\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u4e3a\u5185\u751f\u6027\u4e92\u52a9\u5316\u73b0\u91d1-\u62b5\u62bc\u5151\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u91d1\u878d\u4f53\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8d44\u4ea7\u3001\u591a\u6cd5\u5f81\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u8d37\u5e02\u573a\u3001DLT\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u6027\u3002"}}

This study observes that, while the United States adopts a parallel investigation model, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) conduct independent yet coordinated proceedings, Singapore employs a joint investigation framework integrating the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) to ensure procedural fairness and transparency. By contrast, India centralizes investigative, adjudicative, and prosecutorial powers within the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), a model that raises concerns regarding functional overlap, procedural efficiency, and the perception of impartiality. Drawing on statutory provisions, case law, regulatory manuals, and policy reports, this study identifies the critical enforcement gaps in India's current framework. Emphasis is placed on the evidentiary standard required to establish violations, absence of structured inter-agency cooperation, and limited adoption of global enforcement best practices. The analysis situates these shortcomings against the principles of credible deterrence articulated by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), arguing that without institutional separation of functions and strengthened coordination between civil and criminal enforcement authorities, India's capacity to address market misconduct will remain constrained."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u7684\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f8e\u56fd\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u800c\u5370\u5ea6\u5c06\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u88c1\u51b3\u548c\u8d77\u8bc9\u6743\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u6784SEBI\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u5ea6\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6743\u529b\u5206\u914d\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u548c\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u6709\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5370\u5ea6\u73b0\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u6cd5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5370\u5ea6\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u4f53\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u56fd\u9645\u8bc1\u5238\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08IOSCO\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5a01\u6151\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u673a\u6784\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u6c11\u4e8b\u5211\u4e8b\u6267\u6cd5\u673a\u6784\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u89c4\u6761\u6b3e\u3001\u5224\u4f8b\u6cd5\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u624b\u518c\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u56fd\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "\u7f8e\u56fdSEC\u548cDOJ\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761MAS\u548cCAD\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6SEBI\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e09\u6743\u4e8e\u4e00\u8eab\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1IOSCO\u53ef\u4fe1\u5a01\u6151\u539f\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5370\u5ea6\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u673a\u6784\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u6c11\u4e8b\u5211\u4e8b\u6267\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u6539\u9769\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Optimizing shipfrom-store (SFS), Buy Online Pick Up In-Store (BOPIS), and Distribution Center (DC) allocation under dynamic constraints requires sophisticated analytics. This research paper presents a comprehensive framework leveraging quantum-informed algorithms and simulation-based analytics for routing optimization within omnichannel fulfillment networks. We integrate multi-source data (demand forecasts, geospatial locations, operational costs, node capacities) into multi-objective optimization models. Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulate complex fulfillment scenarios, while quantum annealing principles address NP-hard routing problems intractable for classical solvers at scale. Comparative analysis demonstrates that hybrid approaches combining metaheuristics, simulation, and quantum-informed logic significantly reduce fulfillment costs (12-18%), improve on-time delivery performance (15-22%), enhance capacity utilization (10-15%), and decrease last-mile emissions (8-12%) compared to traditional rule-based or isolated optimization methods. The framework provides robust decision support under demand volatility and network constraints, offering retailers a scalable path towards efficient and sustainable omnichannel fulfillment."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u6e20\u9053\u96f6\u552e\u4e2d\u7684\u914d\u9001\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u914d\u9001\u65f6\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5168\u6e20\u9053\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316ship-from-store\u3001BOPIS\u548c\u914d\u9001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u6e20\u9053\u96f6\u552e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u914d\u9001\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u6e20\u9053\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u539f\u7406\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\uff08\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u5bb9\u91cf\uff09\u5230\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u914d\u9001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3NP\u96be\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "findings": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f+\u6a21\u62df+\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u914d\u9001\u6210\u672c\uff0812-18%\uff09\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u65f6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7387\uff0815-22%\uff09\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u5bb9\u91cf\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0810-15%\uff09\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u6392\u653e\uff088-12%\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21NP\u96be\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5168\u6e20\u9053\u914d\u9001\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

As industries increasingly adopt automated technologies, understanding the balance between enhanced productivity and workforce displacement becomes crucial. The research examines how automation affects operational efficiency, cost structures, and market positioning within the global manufacturing landscape. Additionally, it explores the ramifications for domestic labor markets, focusing on job displacement, skill requirements, and potential shifts in employment patterns.

To explore this issue, this Essay introduces the concept of the \"American Legal Mind\" (ALM) defined as a distinctive pattern of legal thought shaped by the historical evolution of U.S. legal culture, particularly in relation to international law. Drawing from judicial practice and scholarly commentary, this Essay argues that ALM embodies a strong form of dualism, treating compliance with international law as a matter of political discretion. To test this claim, the Essay examines how the U.S. trade court engages with World Trade Organization (WTO) precedent. It finds that the court selectively invokes WTO case law, embracing it when aligned with U.S. agency decisions while dismissing it as \"non-binding\" when in conflict. Ultimately, the U.S. trade court's approach to WTO precedent serves less as a normative guide shaping legal reasoning and more as a post hoc justification for predetermined positions. The Essay concludes by advocating for an American legal education that fosters greater openness to diverse legal traditions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7279\u6717\u666e2.0\u65f6\u4ee3\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u79e9\u5e8f\u7684\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\"\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u601d\u7ef4\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d38\u6613\u6cd5\u9662\u5bf9WTO\u5224\u4f8b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5982\u4f55\u8ba4\u77e5\u56fd\u9645\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\uff1f\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u601d\u7ef4\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7279\u6717\u666e2.0\u65f6\u4ee3\u7f8e\u56fd\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u5730\u7834\u574f\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u79e9\u5e8f\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u5176\u56fd\u9645\u89c4\u8303\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u8d28\u7591", "theoretical_framework": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u601d\u7ef4\uff08ALM\uff09\u7406\u8bba - \u7531\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6cd5\u5f8b\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\u4f53\u73b0\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u4e3b\u4e49", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u53f8\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d38\u6613\u6cd5\u9662\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u7528WTO\u5224\u4f8b", "findings": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d38\u6613\u6cd5\u9662\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f15\u7528WTO\u5224\u4f8b\uff1a\u5f53\u4e0e\u7f8e\u673a\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u91c7\u7eb3\uff0c\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u5219\u4ee5\"\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u529b\"\u4e3a\u7531\u62d2\u7edd\uff1bWTO\u5224\u4f8b\u66f4\u591a\u7528\u4f5c\u4e8b\u540e\u5408\u7406\u5316\u800c\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6307\u5bfc", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u601d\u7ef4\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e8c\u5143\u4e3b\u4e49\u7279\u5f81", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u66f4\u52a0\u5f00\u653e\u5305\u5bb9\u4e0d\u540c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f20\u7edf"}}

This property, which strengthens the absence of calendar-spread arbitrage, holds in many, but not all standard theoretical models. We investigate whether it holds empirically in the market for call options on the S&amp;P 500 index, and whether a closely related property holds for puts. We find that violations of TP 2 are rare and usually reverse quickly. We examine the combinations of strikes and expiries most likely to produce violations, and we investigate the impact of market conditions on violation rates. We propose long-short option trading strategies designed to profit from violations. In our preferred implementation, these strategies substantially outperform the index on both an absolute and risk-adjusted basis. Individual trades based on individual TP 2 violations have very high hit rates.

The analysis specifically examines the impact of domestic credit growth as a proxy for demand shocks and commodity price volatility representing supply shocks on the inflation. The findings reveal a significant asymmetry in inflation's responsiveness. Inflation in both commodity exporters and importers demonstrates a remarkably faster and stronger reaction to supply-side disturbances stemming from global commodity price fluctuations. The inflationary peak following a commodity price shock is notably higher and occurs more rapidly, indicating an immediate and substantial pass-through effect. In contrast, the inflationary impact of demand shocks, proxied by credit growth, is comparatively more subdued and evolves at a slower pace, with a lower peak magnitude. This differential responsiveness underscores the heightened vulnerability of commodity-importing nations to external price shocks.

Firms pay a fixed cost to enter the market and then produce a product variety represented by their location on the circle at a private per unit cost drawn from a common cost distribution. The demand for a firm's good is determined by the prices firms set simultaneously. In this setting we show that under a standard regularity condition on the cost distribution there exists a unique equilibrium in which firms enter the market if and only if their costs are lower than an endogenous level and then set prices based own costs, the conditional (post-entry) expectation of rival firm costs and the number of firms. The equilibrium threshold cost level is decreasing in the entry cost parameter as well as in the number of potential entrants. We show that under an additional restriction on the cost distribution the average price decreases with the threshold cost level. Finally, we provide closed form expressions for various welfare measures in the market that help identify the impact of private information. Interestingly, cost variance positively affects both consumer and producer surplus. While we provide sufficient conditions for positive entry restrictions to be welfare improving, we also show that for many common families of cost distributions the sufficient conditions do not hold and in fact is optimal from both consumer and producer perspective to set zero entry restrictions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5706\u5f62\u4ea7\u54c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u7ade\u4e89\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u6839\u636e\u79c1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u8fdb\u5165\u5e02\u573a\u5e76\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u548c\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u79c1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u51fa\u8fdb\u5165\u548c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f\u79c1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u548c\u798f\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4f01\u4e1a\u79c1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u8fdb\u5165\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u7ade\u4e89\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ee9\u6548\u548c\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eSalop\u5706\u5f62\u57ce\u5e02\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f01\u4e1a\u79c1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u5706\u4e0a\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u652f\u4ed8\u56fa\u5b9a\u8fdb\u5165\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u79c1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u8fdb\u5165\u5e02\u573a\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4ef7\u683c\u3002", "findings": "\u5b58\u5728\u552f\u4e00\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ec5\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5185\u751f\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u8fdb\u5165\u5e02\u573a\uff1b\u5747\u8861\u9608\u503c\u968f\u8fdb\u5165\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8fdb\u5165\u8005\u6570\u91cf\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u5dee\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u5269\u4f59\u90fd\u6709\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5e38\u89c1\u6210\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u96f6\u8fdb\u5165\u9650\u5236\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4ea7\u54c1\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u79c1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u552f\u4e00\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u8fdb\u5165\u9650\u5236\u7684\u798f\u5229\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96f6\u8fdb\u5165\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u90fd\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002"}}

This article explores how variations in climate, topography, resource distribution, and environmental risks condition state formation, economic strategies, and spatial inequalities across different global regions. Drawing on interdisciplinary research from political geography, environmental economics, and spatial planning, the study develops a comparative analytical framework that connects ecological factors with economic performance and geopolitical behaviour. The research examines a global dataset encompassing variables such as climatic zones, temperature and precipitation averages, arable land percentage, natural hazard exposure, and resource endowment per capita. States are categorized into environmental typologies\u2014arid, tropical, temperate, polar, and mountainous\u2014and analysed for their influence on agricultural viability, settlement distribution, infrastructure development, and trade competitiveness. Statistical analysis reveals strong correlations between temperate climates and diversified economic activity, while arid and tropical conditions often correlate with lower productivity, food insecurity, and dependency on external assistance. However, exceptions such as oilrich desert states or resilient small island economies underscore the importance of institutional adaptation and policy innovation. The study also investigates how environmental vulnerability\u2014 particularly to climate change, natural disasters, and water scarcity\u2014shapes economic resilience and geopolitical positioning. Countries highly exposed to sea level rise, droughts, or cyclones, such as Bangladesh, Tuvalu, or the Sahelian states, face compounded challenges requiring both national mitigation strategies and international support mechanisms. Spatial disparities in environmental assets and hazards create uneven developmental trajectories, reinforcing regional inequalities within and between states. Ultimately, the article argues that environmental conditions, while not deterministic, exert a profound structural influence on the developmental landscape of nations.

Leveraging the case of Taiwan's 2022 local elections-where a mayoral candidate pledged to provide free Gogoro electric motorcycles-we employ the Synthetic Control Method to construct counterfactual sales paths for both electric and gasoline-powered motorcycles. Our results reveal a substantial decline in electric motorcycle registrations immediately following the policy announcement and again after the candidate's electoral victory, while gasoline motorcycle sales remain largely unaffected. This pattern indicates that the anticipated subsidy induced forward-looking consumers to delay purchases, resulting in significant intertemporal substitution. In contrast, the absence of a response in gasoline motorcycle sales suggests limited cross-category substitution. A complementary difference-indifferences analysis conducted after the policy's formal rollout in July 2023 further shows that ignoring these anticipation effects would lead to overestimated policy impacts.

Since its inception in 1913, the central bank has operated in the background, often under a veil of infallibility, given its complex economic toolkit and separation from the broader political community. However, the history of the Fed and its actions in financially devastating eras of American banking tell a vastly different story. Beginning with a concrete comparison of the Fed toolkit and those of the federal government, a necessity for a central bank that can respond to the ebbs and flows of monetary demand is established. Further analysis breaks down the historical failures of the Fed to respond in times of financial crises, with an emphasis on the Great Depression. In particular, this paper examines the unraveling of New Deal regulations, how that led to the 2008 financial crisis, and the Fed\u2019s response to the 2008 crisis, which was quantitative easing. The analysis concludes with a call for bipartisan reforms to American finance and banking to protect consumers and the financial stability of Americans.&nbsp;</span>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u8427\u6761\u52302008\u5e74\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u4e24\u515a\u5408\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u91d1\u878d\u6539\u9769\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e2d\u592e\u94f6\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u5e94\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u5176\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4f46\u6700\u88ab\u8bef\u89e3\u7684\u6743\u529b\u673a\u6784\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u754c\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u4f7f\u5176\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u73b0\u5374\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e2d\u592e\u94f6\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u5e94\u5bf9\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u5386\u53f2\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5927\u8427\u6761\u30012008\u5e74\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\uff09", "findings": "\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u591a\u6b21\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u8427\u6761\u671f\u95f4\uff1b\u65b0\u76d1\u7ba1\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u74e6\u89e3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e862008\u5e74\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u5bbd\u677e\u662f\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u5bf92008\u5e74\u5371\u673a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u4e2d\u592e\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u4e24\u515a\u6539\u9769\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u53d6\u63aa\u65bd\u4fdd\u62a4\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a"}}

This paper studies optimal investment in ecosystem restoration under environmental change. We develop an optimal control model of the restoration decision to explicitly characterize the optimal extent and timing of restoration given time-dependent marginal damages. We provide the first results on optimal dynamic investment in ecosystem restoration, highlighting the important role that growth in restored patches plays in shaping the time profile of investment. We then apply the model in a numerical simulation of coastal wetlands restoration in Huntington Beach, California, that accounts for projected sea-level rise, uncertainty over flooding severity, and the option to abandon damage properties. Our results show that early investments in restoration are optimal in order build up a wetlands stock that can mitigate future flooding damages exacerbated by sea-level rise. We find large option values associated with delaying irreversible decisions to abandon damaged properties."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6062\u590d\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5dde\u4ea8\u5ef7\u987f\u6d77\u6ee9\u6e7f\u5730\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u6295\u8d44\u6062\u590d\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u6e7f\u5730\u5b58\u91cf\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u672a\u6765\u6d77\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u5347\u52a0\u5267\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u635f\u5bb3\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653e\u5f03\u53d7\u635f\u8d22\u4ea7\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u671f\u6743\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u4f18\u6062\u590d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u673a\u9009\u62e9", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u6062\u590d\u9000\u5316\u73af\u5883\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u4f18\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6062\u590d\u6295\u8d44", "theoretical_framework": "\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9e\u7269\u671f\u6743\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u523b\u753b\u6062\u590d\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8fb9\u9645\u635f\u5bb3\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u52a0\u5dde\u4ea8\u5ef7\u987f\u6d77\u6ee9\u6e7f\u5730\u6062\u590d\u6848\u4f8b", "findings": "\u65e9\u671f\u6295\u8d44\u6062\u590d\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u6e7f\u5730\u5b58\u91cf\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u672a\u6765\u6d77\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u5347\u52a0\u5267\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u635f\u5bb3\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff1b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653e\u5f03\u53d7\u635f\u8d22\u4ea7\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u671f\u6743\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u6062\u590d\u6591\u5757\u7684\u751f\u957f\u5728\u5851\u9020\u6295\u8d44\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6062\u590d\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u6001\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8fb9\u9645\u635f\u5bb3\u548c\u6062\u590d\u6591\u5757\u751f\u957f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8003\u8651", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6cbf\u6d77\u6e7f\u5730\u6062\u590d\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u6d77\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u65f6\u673a\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u671f\u6743\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027"}}

Conditional on exogenous cost factors, private firms charge on average seven percent higher prices compared to their municipal counterparts. Nearly all firms employ two-part pricing. Consistent with standard monopoly theory, the entire price difference can be explained by the fixed price component. Further, foreign-owned private firms charge an additional price premium relative to domestically owned private firms. A descriptive analysis of financial statements confirms that private firms achieve higher profit margins, despite municipal firms being legally required to operate in a businesslike manner. These findings demonstrate that, in this market, private firms exercise more market power than public firms, and that the subsequent upward pressure on prices dominates any downward effects from the potential cost efficiencies associated with privatization."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u745e\u5178\u5730\u533a\u4f9b\u6696\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e0e\u5e02\u653f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e73\u5747\u6536\u8d39\u9ad8\u51fa7%\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u56fa\u5b9a\u8d39\u7528\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u8fd1\u90fd\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6cd5\u3002\u5916\u8d44\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u8d22\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u5229\u6da6\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "research_question": "\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e0e\u5e02\u653f\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u5730\u533a\u4f9b\u6696\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5730\u533a\u4f9b\u6696\u5e02\u573a\u5177\u6709\u5730\u7406\u6027\u72ec\u5360\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u964d\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u6240\u6709\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u529b\u91cf\u5c55\u73b0\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6807\u51c6\u72ec\u5360\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5916\u751f\u6210\u672c\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u79c1\u8425\u548c\u5e02\u653f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d22\u52a1\u62a5\u8868\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5229\u6da6\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "findings": "\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e73\u5747\u6536\u8d39\u9ad87%\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5168\u90e8\u6765\u81ea\u56fa\u5b9a\u8d39\u7528\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u5916\u8d44\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u5229\u6da6\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5e02\u653f\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5730\u7406\u72ec\u5360\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u529b\u91cf\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6548\u7387\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u505a\u51fa\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8865\u5145\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u5e9c\u5236\u5b9a\u516c\u5171\u4e8b\u4e1a\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u544a\u8beb\u5728\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u7136\u72ec\u5360\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u8c28\u614e\u5bf9\u5f85\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u89c6\u5e02\u653f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u76d1\u7ba1\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The 2004 tax reform in Poland implemented an optional broad-base low-rate \u201cflat\u201d tax for business incomes. Taxpayers who chose the flat tax treatment had to give up most tax preferences (resulting in a variation in incentives to adopt), but they benefited from the lower tax rates. For the highest income taxpayers, the marginal tax rate fell from 40% to 19%. using a large panel of individual tax returns, I demonstrate massive increases in reported incomes that resulted in small tax revenue consequences despite large reductions in tax rates. Conservative estimates indicate that a suitably designed flat tax option would increase revenue. The responses are most likely operating through a reduction in tax avoidance or participation in the gray economy, implying that when the avoidance margin is responsive, a reform involving base-broadening combined with marginal tax rate reductions that allows taxpayers to self-select can be Pareto improving. The paper also highlights empirical issues involved in estimating the responsiveness of taxable income and suggests that violations of exclusion restrictions due to heterogeneous earnings dynamics may be responsible for the \u201csensitivity\u201d of results claimed elsewhere in the literature."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u6ce2\u51702004\u5e74\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u6539\u9769\u5141\u8bb8\u4f01\u4e1a\u6536\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u5bbd\u7a0e\u57fa\u4f4e\u7a0e\u7387\u7684\"\u6241\u5e73\"\u7a0e\u5236\uff0c\u7eb3\u7a0e\u4eba\u653e\u5f03\u7a0e\u6536\u4f18\u60e0\u4f46\u4eab\u53d7\u4f4e\u7a0e\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u8005\u8fb9\u9645\u7a0e\u7387\u4ece40%\u964d\u81f319%\u540e\uff0c\u7533\u62a5\u6536\u5165\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7a0e\u6536\u6536\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u5f88\u5c0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u9009\u9879\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u6536\u5165\u3002", "research_question": "\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u6539\u9769\u5bf9\u7eb3\u7a0e\u4eba\u7533\u62a5\u6536\u5165\u548c\u7a0e\u6536\u6536\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u6539\u9769\u662f\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6ce2\u51702004\u5e74\u7684\u7a0e\u6539\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\u673a\u4f1a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7a0e\u6536\u5f39\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7a0e\u6536\u89c4\u907f\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u81ea\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u4e2a\u4eba\u7eb3\u7a0e\u7533\u62a5\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7eb3\u7a0e\u4eba\u9009\u62e9\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u5236\u540e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u7a0e\u6536\u6536\u5165\u53d8\u5316", "findings": "\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u7eb3\u7a0e\u4eba\u8fb9\u9645\u7a0e\u7387\u4ece40%\u964d\u81f319%\u540e\uff0c\u7533\u62a5\u6536\u5165\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u7a0e\u6536\u6536\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u5f88\u5c0f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u9009\u9879\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u6536\u5165\uff1b\u53cd\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u7a0e\u6536\u89c4\u907f\u6216\u7070\u8272\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0", "theory_contributions": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u907f\u7a0e\u8fb9\u9645\u5177\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a0e\u57fa\u62d3\u5bbd\u548c\u8fb9\u9645\u7a0e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u6539\u9769\u5141\u8bb8\u7eb3\u7a0e\u4eba\u81ea\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e94\u7a0e\u6536\u5165\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u6539\u9769\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6241\u5e73\u7a0e\u9009\u9879\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u7a0e\u6536\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u7a0e\u6536\u89c4\u907f\u884c\u4e3a"}}

Given the critical role these mechanisms play in sustaining cooperation, why are they so frequently missing? To explore this, we conducted an online experiment testing whether individuals choose to implement such cooperation-inducing mechanisms and why they might refrain from doing so. Participants were introduced to the rules of two public goods games, one of which includes a cooperation-inducing mechanism, while the other does not. Regarding the likelihood of successful cooperation, we found that participants were overly optimistic in the absence of the mechanism and overly pessimistic in its presence. As a result, a majority of subjects preferred the game without the cooperation-inducing mechanism.

Agents interact strategically by anticipating the influence of their individual savings and labor supply decisions on the realized factor prices. We provide conditions under which Nash equilibrium generates uniquely determined growth paths. These <i>Nash-equilibrium growth paths</i> may be non-monotonic and thus differ qualitatively from the perfect-foresight growth paths in case of competitive markets. Relative to price takers with correct expectations, agents with market power strategically cut back on their savings and labor supply to increase the factor prices. The resulting under-provision of production factors reduces capital accumulation and long-term output. Population growth restores the competitive outcomes and smooths away endogenous fluctuations. These findings imply that competitive factor markets are crucial for strong and stable economic growth."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u4ee3\u4ea4\u53e0\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u5bf9\u8d44\u672c\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u50a8\u84c4\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u671f\u4ea7\u51fa\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d44\u672c\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u8981\u7d20\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5355\u90e8\u95e8\u4e16\u4ee3\u4ea4\u53e0\u6a21\u578b(OLG model)\uff0c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u4e92\u52a8\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6218\u7565\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e16\u4ee3\u4ea4\u53e0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u589e\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7279\u6027", "findings": "1) \u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u589e\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u5355\u8c03\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u9884\u89c1\u589e\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b2) \u5177\u6709\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u4f1a\u6218\u7565\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u50a8\u84c4\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8981\u7d20\u4ef7\u683c\uff1b3) \u751f\u4ea7\u8981\u7d20\u7684\u4f9b\u7ed9\u4e0d\u8db3\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d44\u672c\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4ea7\u51fa\uff1b4) \u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u5e73\u6ed1\u5185\u751f\u6ce2\u52a8", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e16\u4ee3\u4ea4\u53e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u6218\u7565\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6743\u529b\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u5e02\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u8981\u7d20\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u5f3a\u52b2\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5b89\u6392\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e"}}

Drawing on archival sources and industry data, the research demonstrates how community managers developed foundational digital governance approaches decades before formal trust and safety teams emerged.&nbsp;<span>Beginning with 1970s examples like the Community Memory Project, the analysis shows how early community managers functioned as cultural intermediaries who established social norms, facilitated interactions, and protected users from harm while possessing robust technical agency to shape both computational systems and cultural practices.&nbsp;</span><span>Two waves of platformisation fundamentally altered this landscape. The first (late 1990s-early 2000s) saw commercial platforms commodify social relations while divesting community managers of technical control, transforming them from techno-social experts into reactive moderators. The second wave prioritised algorithmic efficiency over relational nuance, further \"atomising\" their work into individual content processing rather than holistic community stewardship. T</span><span>he chapter reveals an inverse relationship between rising \"trust and safety\" terminology and declining \"online community manager\" usage, indicating a structural shift towards top-down risk management. Contemporary practitioners report increasing marginalisation despite their expertise in social cohesion and psychological safety.&nbsp;</span><span>The research argues that excluding community management expertise undermines digital community resilience and advocates for reintegrating their contextual, relational approaches into contemporary trust and safety frameworks.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u6700\u65e9\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\uff0c\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u6570\u5b57\u5148\u9a71\u5230\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5728\u6b63\u5f0f\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u56e2\u961f\u51fa\u73b0\u524d\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u5c31\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u6280\u672f-\u793e\u4f1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u5f53\u4ee3\u5e73\u53f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\uff1f\u8fd9\u79cd\u6f14\u53d8\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u793e\u533a\u6cbb\u7406\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5e73\u53f0\u5316\u6d6a\u6f6e\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5730\u4f4d\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5386\u53f2\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u5f53\u4ee3\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u793e\u533a\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5e73\u53f0\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6027\u8d28\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5730\u4f4d\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6863\u6848\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4ece1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u793e\u533a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9879\u76ee\u5230\u5f53\u4ee3\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\u3002", "findings": "1) \u65e9\u671f\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u517c\u5177\u6280\u672f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89d2\u8272\uff1b2) \u4e24\u6ce2\u5e73\u53f0\u5316\u6d6a\u6f6e\u5265\u593a\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6280\u672f\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u8005\uff1b3) \"\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\"\u672f\u8bed\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4e0e\"\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\"\u7528\u8bed\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u5448\u53cd\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b4) \u5f53\u4ee3\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5c3d\u7ba1\u62e5\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u51dd\u805a\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5374\u65e5\u76ca\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u6cbb\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u6cbb\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e73\u53f0\u5316\u5bf9\u4e13\u4e1a\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5021\u5bfc\u5c06\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u65b0\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5f53\u4ee3\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u5b57\u793e\u533a\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The House settlement has introduced a $20.5 million yearly expense that universities must pay in order to compete for top-level talent in revenue generating sports such as college football and basketball. However, declining enrollment and unequal TV rights distributions have left some universities scrambling to figure out how to stay competitive in this new revenue-sharing era. Enter private equity.

While headline indicators such as GDP growth (4.61%) and declining inflation (3.39%) signal short-term stability, the simultaneous rise in public debt, dependence on loan-based foreign aid, and persistent trade imbalances underscore systemic vulnerabilities. This viewpoint paper critically analyzes key macroeconomic, fiscal, and sectoral trends to assess the depth of Nepal's economic resilience. It argues that sustaining recovery will require a coordinated policy shift toward strategic capital investment, improved revenue mobilization, financial sector discipline, and diversified growth drivers. By linking empirical observations to actionable reform priorities, the paper contributes to broader policy discussions on ensuring long-term economic sustainability and inclusive development in Nepal."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u89c2\u70b9\u6587\u7ae0\u5206\u6790\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c142081\u8d22\u5e74\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u867d\u7136\u77ed\u671f\u6307\u6807\u5448\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u589e\u957f\u3001\u8d38\u6613\u5931\u8861\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u6295\u8d44\u3001\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u589e\u957f\u52a8\u529b\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u590d\u82cf\u3002", "research_question": "\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u5728\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f39\u6027\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u7ef4\u6301\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u82cf\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5728\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u671f\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u77ed\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u5f39\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d22\u653f\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8d38\u6613\u5e73\u8861\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6539\u9769\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8d22\u653f\u5e742081\u5e74\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u8d22\u653f\u548c\u90e8\u95e8\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGDP\u589e\u957f\u7387(4.61%)\u3001\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u7387(3.39%)\u3001\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u3001\u8d38\u6613\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u77ed\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\u5448\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\uff1a\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u5916\u63f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d37\u6b3e\u3001\u8d38\u6613\u5931\u8861\u6301\u7eed\u3002\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f39\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6539\u9769\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u590d\u82cf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f39\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u77ed\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u505a\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u653f\u5e9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6218\u7565\u8d44\u672c\u6295\u8d44\u3001\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u589e\u957f\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

These forecasts overlook a crucial fact: societies are not homogeneous. Using the Bisin-Verdier model of cultural transmission with endogenous fertility and direct socialization, calibrated to U.S. and global religion data, we identify an evolutionary counterforce. Subpopulations with persistently high fertility survive, expand their share, and push the total fertility rate (TFR) upward over time.

Joint tax audits aim to resolve potential tax disputes early, before such disputes escalate into costly and time-consuming resolution procedures that may not fully eliminate double taxation. Employing a game-theoretic model, we identify settings in which we expect joint audits to occur and investigate their effect on the firm's expected tax payments and tax audit efficiency. We find that the occurrence of joint audits critically depends on the double taxation risk in the absence of joint audits. Unless tax rules are consistently applied, joint audits can occur more often when this risk is higher. The reason is that the firm changes its income-shifting strategy to reduce its expected tax payments, and thereby also enables tax authorities to better target tax disputes via joint audits that would otherwise escalate. However, we identify conditions under which joint audits are then detrimental to tax audit efficiency, particularly when the firm prefers them most. Our results imply that cost-sharing arrangements for joint audits should be tailored to the level of double taxation risk, with firm involvement having the potential to improve efficiency when this risk is high."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7a0e\u52a1\u673a\u5173\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u5408\u7a0e\u52a1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5883\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6267\u6cd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8054\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u7a0e\u6536\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u504f\u597d\u65f6\u5bf9\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u7a0e\u52a1\u673a\u5173\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u5408\u7a0e\u52a1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5883\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6267\u6cd5\u5de5\u5177\uff1f\u8054\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u9884\u671f\u7a0e\u8d39\u652f\u4ed8\u548c\u7a0e\u52a1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8054\u5408\u7a0e\u52a1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e8\u5728\u53ca\u65e9\u89e3\u51b3\u6f5c\u5728\u7a0e\u52a1\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5176\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u53cc\u91cd\u7a0e\u6536\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6e38\u620f\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7a0e\u52a1\u673a\u5173\u4e0e\u591a\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u8de8\u5883\u7a0e\u52a1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8054\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7a0e\u8d39\u652f\u4ed8\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u8054\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u7a0e\u6536\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u7a0e\u8d39\u89c4\u5219\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4f1a\u4fc3\u4f7f\u8054\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u66f4\u5e38\u53d1\u751f\uff1b\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f1a\u8c03\u6574\u653f\u7b56\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u671f\u7a0e\u8d39\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a0e\u52a1\u673a\u5173\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u7a0e\u52a1\u4e89\u8bae\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u7a0e\u52a1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5176\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u5bf9\u5404\u65b9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u8de8\u5883\u7a0e\u52a1\u6267\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7a0e\u52a1\u673a\u5173\u5236\u5b9a\u8054\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\u5171\u62c9\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6839\u636e\u53cc\u91cd\u7a0e\u6536\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u6210\u672c\u5206\u62c5\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8ba9\u4f01\u4e1a\u53c2\u4e0e\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

During these periods, to ease the debt burden, central banks may face pressure to deviate from policy targets. Under fiscal dominance, debt sustainability relies on low interest rates and high inflation rather than consolidation. This paper empirically tests the presence of fiscal dominance using forward-looking Taylor rules and data from 52 economies over 3 decades. The results detect fiscal dominance, with stronger effects in de jure inflation-targeting emerging economies with low central bank independence, especially those without debt rules and with high debt-to-gross domestic product ratios. Emerging economies with high foreign currency-denominated debt are further affected by exchange rate debt valuation effects, and fiscal dominance leads their central banks to follow exchange rate stabilization policies. Since 2022\u20132023, interest rate responses to fiscal imbalances have strengthened, posing challenges for future policy."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u8d22\u653f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u6cd5\u5b9a\u901a\u80c0\u76ee\u6807\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u592e\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u65e0\u503a\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u4e14\u503a\u52a1/GDP\u6bd4\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d22\u653f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u9ad8\u5916\u5e01\u503a\u52a1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u8fd8\u53d7\u6c47\u7387\u503a\u52a1\u4f30\u503c\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u592e\u884c\u91c7\u53d6\u6c47\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u30022022-2023\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u5229\u7387\u5bf9\u8d22\u653f\u5931\u8861\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "research_question": "\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u8d22\u653f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u73b0\u8c61\uff1f\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8d22\u653f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f4e\u8ff7\u548c\u7a0e\u6536\u51cf\u5c11\u5bfc\u81f4\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u592e\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u504f\u79bb\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u503a\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4e\u5229\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u901a\u80c0\u800c\u975e\u8d22\u653f\u6574\u987f", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d22\u653f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6cf0\u52d2\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u503a\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u6cf0\u52d2\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5206\u679052\u4e2a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f5330\u5e74\u7684\u6570\u636e", "findings": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8d22\u653f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u5b9a\u901a\u80c0\u76ee\u6807\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4e2d\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u592e\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u65e0\u503a\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u9ad8\u503a\u52a1/GDP\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u3002\u9ad8\u5916\u5e01\u503a\u52a1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u8fd8\u53d7\u6c47\u7387\u4f30\u503c\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d22\u653f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u8d22\u653f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u8b66\u793a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u5229\u7387\u5bf9\u8d22\u653f\u5931\u8861\u53cd\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49"}}

We explain funds&apos; carbon footprint around the world. Using a sample of equity mutual funds domiciled in 17 countries, representing more than 80% of the equity fund worldwide market, we can explain fund carbon footprint by fund characteristics such as style of management and investment sectors. Even after controlling for fund characteristics, differences across countries remain. Funds domiciled in Scandinavian countries appear to have the lowest carbon footprint. The most robust factors explaining these cross-country differences in carbon footprint are the average level of education, reflecting investor sophistication and awareness about environmental issues, and fund investment zone&apos;s environmental performance.

Rooted in complexity science, cybernetics, quantum information theory, and systems philosophy, the Omnia Equation advances a universal logic of change built on three interdependent principles: <em>recursive coherence</em>, <em>adaptive intelligence</em>, and <em>multi-scale emergence</em>. It addresses the fragmentation of contemporary knowledge by identifying underlying transformation patterns common to matter, life, thought, and society. Drawing on Indigenous cosmologies, recent advances in artificial intelligence, and the mathematics of self-organization, the model proposes a meta-disciplinary science of transformation that could guide humanity from systemic crisis toward integrative civilizational renewal.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Omnia Equation\u8fd9\u4e00\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u3001\u751f\u7269\u5230\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7b49\u6240\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u8bba\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u54f2\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u9012\u5f52\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d8c\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u539f\u5219\u7684\u666e\u9002\u53d8\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u6240\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u7269\u7406\u3001\u751f\u7269\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u6280\u672f\uff09\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u4ee3\u77e5\u8bc6\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7269\u8d28\u3001\u751f\u547d\u3001\u601d\u60f3\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u5171\u540c\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u8f6c\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5371\u673a\u8d70\u5411\u6574\u5408\u6027\u6587\u660e\u590d\u5174\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u590d\u6742\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u8bba\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5b87\u5b99\u89c2\u3001\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u5b66", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u590d\u6742\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u8bba\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u5b87\u5b99\u89c2\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u5b66\uff09", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d8c\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u539f\u5219\u7684Omnia Equation\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u5404\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b", "theory_contributions": "\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u666e\u9002\u53d8\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5371\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6574\u5408\u6027\u6587\u660e\u590d\u5174\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177"}}

Rather than treating teams as collections of individuals or manageable units, I frame them as self-observing communication systems. Within this framework, observation architectures\u2014the semantic, spatial, and temporal arrangements through which teams observe their own observation\u2014constitute group reality. Three concepts are introduced: (1) resonance as the core dynamic of collective self-observation, (2) semantic markers as communicative condensations that orient systems under uncertainty, and (3) structured openness as the architectural condition that enables productive self-organization. Empirical illustrations from Google\u2019s Project Aristotle, MIT\u2019s research on collective intelligence, and Phil Jackson\u2019s Triangle Offense in basketball demonstrate how peak performance emerges without central control, innovation without planning, and coordination without external design. This reframing dissolves what I call the \u201ccontrol illusion\u201d: the persistent assumption that groups can be externally managed. Instead, organizational evolution becomes observable as a process of resonance and self-restructuring. The implications extend to leadership, complex adaptive systems, and emergent team phenomena, providing a diagnostic framework for understanding how communication systems constitute their own possibilities.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u5171\u632f\u91cd\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u56e2\u961f\u89c6\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e2a\u4f53\u96c6\u5408\u6216\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u671f\u671b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u56e2\u961f\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u56e2\u961f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u9645\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\uff1f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u56e2\u961f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\"\u63a7\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\"\uff0c\u5373\u6307\u63a7\u5236\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5916\u90e8\u7ba1\u7406\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u8ba7\u56e2\u961f\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u6211\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u89c2\u5bdf\u6c9f\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\u5171\u632f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Google\u7684Project Aristotle\u3001MIT\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u6167\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7bee\u7403\u4e09\u89d2\u8fdb\u653b\u6218\u672f\u7b49\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "findings": "\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u592e\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u8ba1\u5212\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6d89\u6e38\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u5171\u632f\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u8ba7\u56e2\u961f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u6784\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u3001\u590d\u6742\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7406\u89e3\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6c9f\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u8eab\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e2\u961f\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, if investors have different abilities to process market data, transparency may increase information differences. Exploiting the dissemination of corporate bond market data under the TRACE program, I show that bond market transparency increases equity bid-ask spreads and the price impact of stock trades, which is consistent with an increase in information asymmetry among stock market investors.

Drawing on a robust dataset of over 210,000 loan tranches, including approximately 11,000 PF deals, the study uncovers how legal structure, firm type, and macroeconomic volatility influence the cost and configuration of debt. Project finance loans are found to offer distinct advantages, including longer maturities, narrower credit spreads (especially in Western Europe), and enhanced risk allocation through mechanisms such as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and nonrecourse lending. The paper's econometric models reveal that PF is not only more cost-effective for high-tangibility, lowprofitability, and financially constrained firms, but also becomes increasingly preferred during periods of systemic financial instability. Public and private entities display diverging motivations: public firms use PF for balance sheet optimisation. In contrast, private firms rely on it to gain access to capital markets otherwise unavailable to them. Additionally, this research reveals significant cross-regional disparities, indicating that Western European PF borrowers consistently secure lower pricing compared to their U.S. counterparts, despite controlling for deal size, maturity, and credit conditions. Beyond its core findings, this paper highlights several underexplored yet increasingly relevant dimensions for future inquiry. These include the potential of ESG-linked PF instruments to enhance transparency and sustainability in infrastructure projects; the role of digital innovations, such as tokenised debt and blockchain, in syndicated lending markets; and the importance of regulatory convergence in accounting for off-balancesheet obligations across jurisdictions. It also proposes that PF may serve as a fiscal relief mechanism in times of sovereign debt stress, positioning it as a complementary policy tool to a financing strategy. In doing so, the study extends the theoretical literature on capital structure and financial intermediation, while providing actionable insights for regulators, development banks, institutional lenders, and governments. It reconceptualises project finance not as a niche or exotic funding structure, but as a critical and adaptable pillar of modern financial architecture, especially suited to infrastructure, energy transition, and climate resilience in an era of rising macro-financial uncertainty."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u9879\u76ee\u878d\u8d44\uff08PF\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u516c\u53f8\u878d\u8d44\uff08CF\uff09\u5728\u94f6\u56e2\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u957f\u671f\u9650\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u4fe1\u7528\u5229\u5dee\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\uff09\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6709\u5f62\u8d44\u4ea7\u3001\u4f4e\u76c8\u5229\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u671f\u66f4\u53d7\u9752\u7750\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "\u9879\u76ee\u878d\u8d44\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u878d\u8d44\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6218\u7565\u548c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9879\u76ee\u878d\u8d44\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u878d\u8d44\u5728\u94f6\u56e2\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9879\u76ee\u878d\u8d44\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u914d\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5efa\u8bbe\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u878d\u8d44\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u914d\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7279\u6b8a\u76ee\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\uff08SPV\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u65e0\u8ffd\u7d22\u6743\u8d37\u6b3e\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e2000-2014\u5e74\u5168\u7403\u94f6\u56e2\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a210,000\u591a\u4e2a\u8d37\u6b3e\u4efd\u989d\uff08\u542b\u7ea611,000\u7b14PF\u4ea4\u6613\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790", "findings": "PF\u8d37\u6b3e\u671f\u9650\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u4fe1\u7528\u5229\u5dee\u66f4\u7a84\uff08\u897f\u6b27\u5c24\u5176\u660e\u663e\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6709\u5f62\u8d44\u4ea7\u3001\u4f4e\u76c8\u5229\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u6210\u672c\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u671f\u66f4\u53d7\u9752\u7750\uff1b\u516c\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u52a8\u673a\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u897f\u6b27PF\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u540c\u884c", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u9879\u76ee\u878d\u8d44\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u91d1\u878d\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5173\u952e\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u914d\u548c\u878d\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u94f6\u884c\u3001\u673a\u6784\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u97e7\u6027\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8ESG\u5173\u8054\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u65b0\u5e94\u7528"}}

The research extends beyond immediate price effects by analysing systematic risk variations, specifically examining changes in stock beta coefficients before and after ESG events to measure shifts in firms' reputation risk profiles. Furthermore, this study investigates how ESG news reactions differ during the downturn phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (20 February - 23 March 2020).

The research intends to inform the development of standardised and effective research guidelines for higher education institutions. Methodology-The study employed a descriptive qualitative design using semi-structured interviews. Fifteen (15) purposively selected student-researchers acting as leaders participated in the interview process. Stringent research protocols and ethical considerations were strictly followed. Data from the interview transcripts were analysed using Clarke and Braun's thematic analysis approach to identify recurring patterns and insights. Findings-The results reveal that the degree of formal instruction on research formatting significantly influences students' ability to manage and complete their research projects, impacting both efficiency and quality. Identified challenges include limited guidance, inconsistent formatting standards, and resource constraints.

To understand the implications of such price-cut commitments, this paper develops a two-period supply chain model that captures the dynamic interplay between the manufacturer's cost-reduction investment and the retailers' incentive to hold strategic inventory as a tool to suppress future procurement prices. Our analysis reveals that price-cut commitments do not always harm the manufacturer; instead, they can enhance manufacturer profit and incentivize investment in cost reduction. However, when the market size is large, such commitments may backfire for retailers, reducing their own profit, even in the absence of competition. We identify a Pareto zone in which both the manufacturer and the retailer(s) benefit from the commitment-especially when cost-reduction investment is efficient. In this region, price-cut commitments improve supply chain profit and social welfare. However, retailer competition reduces the likelihood of such commitments being adopted in equilibrium. In particular, we uncover a prisoner's dilemma: although both retailers would be better off with coordinated price-cut commitments, individual incentives lead them to avoid it, resulting in a suboptimal no-commitment outcome. Moreover, when the market size is moderate, asymmetric equilibria may arise-where one retailer seeks a price-cut commitment while the other relies on strategic inventory-further complicating coordination. Finally, we identify a \"two horns are worse than one horn\" effect: under aggressive price-cut pressure and moderate market size, a manufacturer may earn more by selling through a single retailer than facing two competing ones. These findings offer theoretical and managerial insights into when to pursue price-cut commitments versus strategic inventory in retail supply chains."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u8c03\u627f\u8bfa\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u52b1\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u56f0\u5883\u56f0\u5883", "research_question": "\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u8c03\u627f\u8bfa\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5236\u9020\u5546\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u6218\u7565\u5e93\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u7ecf\u5e38\u5411\u4e0a\u6e38\u5236\u9020\u5546\u65bd\u538b\u8981\u6c42\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u8c03\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u627f\u8bfa\u5bf9\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6218\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e24\u5468\u671f\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5236\u9020\u5546\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u6218\u7565\u5e93\u5b58\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u7ece\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5747\u8861", "findings": "1\uff09\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u8c03\u627f\u8bfa\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u635f\u5bb3\u5236\u9020\u5546\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u52b1\u52bf 2\uff09\u5927\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u81ea\u8eab\u5229\u76ca 3\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5e15\u7d0d\u6539\u6539\u5584\u533a\u57df 4\uff09\u7ade\u4e89\u51cf\u5c11\u627f\u8bfa\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6027 5\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5747\u8861 6\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\"\u53cc\u89d2\u6548\u5e94\"\uff1a\u9762\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u5546", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u8c03\u627f\u8bfa\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u5e93\u5b58\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56f0\u5883\u56f0\u5883\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5747\u8861", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u548c\u5236\u9020\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u91c7\u7528\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u8c03\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u907f\u514d\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u9009\u62e9"}}

We quantify the monetary cost of accessing hukou-linked public amenities, measured by a composite index of their quality and accessibility. Our theoretical framework connects housing price discontinuities at administrative borders within the same commuting area to migrants' marginal willingnessto-pay (WTP) for a one-unit increase in this index. By combining nighttime light data to delineate commuting areas with micro-level housing prices, we estimate a marginal WTP ranging from 1.781 to 2.176. For a representative household in Beijing, this corresponds to a cost of up to 1.24 million RMB.

Drawing on recent surveys and market data, this paper examines the forces driving increased participation in content creation, such as low barriers to entry and global reach, while critically assessing its macroeconomic consequences, including the centralization of power and the growing instability of the market. While a small group of high-profile creators make millions, earning a majority of revenue, a vast majority of creators earn far below a livable wage, ultimately revealing a winner-take-all dynamic that mirrors that of other digital freelance markets. In all, the expansion of the creator economy represents both revolutionary change in the market and a cautionary case study on inequality in the digital era, ultimately raising urgent questions regarding its viability as a sustainable alternative to traditional employment.</span>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u6d4e\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u8d62\u5bb6\u901a\u5403\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u5934\u90e8\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u83b7\u5f97\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u6536\u5165\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u751f\u6d3b\u5de5\u8d44\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u5c31\u4e1a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u5c31\u4e1a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4eba\u56e0\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u5c31\u4e1a\u4e0d\u6ee1\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u804c\u4e1a\uff0c\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9884\u8ba1\u5728\u672a\u6765\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u589e\u957f3000\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6570\u5b57\u81ea\u7531\u804c\u4e1a\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u8d62\u5bb6\u901a\u5403\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5e73\u53f0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76", "findings": "\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u51c6\u5165\u95e8\u69db\u548c\u5168\u7403\u8986\u76d6\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u77e5\u540d\u5ea6\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u83b7\u5f97\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u6536\u5165\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u751f\u6d3b\u5de5\u8d44", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u7684\u8d62\u5bb6\u901a\u5403\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u81ea\u7531\u804c\u4e1a\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7406\u89e3", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73b0\u5b9e\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u8b66\u793a\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5c31\u4e1a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

However, to date, systematic evidence linking economic policy uncertainty (EPU) to banking-sector risk and performance outcomes remains limited. This study synthesises evidence on how EPU affects bank credit risk by drawing from nine empirical studies spanning both advanced and emerging economies. The study identifies three consistent patterns across all the studies. First, a higher EPU is associated with higher NPL ratios. Second, bank characteristics (e.g., solvency, profitability, size/ownership) and market structure (concentration) mediate the effect of uncertainty on NPLs. Third, information transparency and digital transformation are crucial tools for mitigating the adverse effects of uncertainty on credit default risk.&nbsp;"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027(EPU)\u5bf9\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u4fe1\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e9\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1aEPU\u4e0e\u4e0d\u826f\u8d37\u6b3e\u6bd4\u7387\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u8d77\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027(EPU)\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u4fe1\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u3001COVID-19\u3001\u7f8e\u4e2d\u8d38\u6613\u7cbe\u5f20\u548cAI\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5730\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u94f6\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4fe1\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u5b9a\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e9\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u53d1\u8fbe\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u5408", "findings": "1\uff09EPU\u9ad8\u4e0e\u4e0d\u826f\u8d37\u6b3e\u6bd4\u7387\u6b63\u76f8\u5173 2\uff09\u94f6\u884c\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u503e\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u89c4\u6a21/\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff09\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\uff09\u8d77\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528 3\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u5177", "theory_contributions": "\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86EPU\u4e0e\u94f6\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7f13\u51b2\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u8fdb\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5236\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u76d1\u7ba1\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003"}}

In this study, we employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to evaluate the impact of Colorado\u2019s conservation investments on easement-level conservation outcomes. Colorado enacted two policies in the 1990s to incentivize conservation: the implementation of lottery dollars to fund conservation projects, and state tax incentives to encourage landowners to put easements on their undeveloped lands. We use fine-scale spatial data on conservation outcomes from counties surrounding the Colorado-Wyoming border to estimate the effects of the conservation investments on four variables of interest: agricultural quality of the land protected, the value of the land protected, easement size, and a measure of how close an easement is placed to other easements. We show that the PACE program in Colorado led to easements on higher quality, lower value land. Our findings suggest that additional funds resulted in conservation decisions that account for both budgetary constraints and state priorities to protect lands of high quality."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u65ad\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u5dde\u519c\u7530\u4fdd\u62a4\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d44\u91d1\u6295\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u519c\u7530\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "research_question": "\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u5dde\u519c\u4e1a\u4fdd\u62a4\u6295\u8d44\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u5730\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6295\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u516c\u5171\u8d44\u91d1\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u7530\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d2d\u4e70\u519c\u4e1a\u4fdd\u62a4\u5730\u5f81\u6743\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u516c\u5171\u6295\u8d44\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u5730\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u3001\u56de\u5f52\u65ad\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u65ad\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08RDD\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a-\u6000\u6602\u660e\u8fb9\u5883\u5468\u8fb9\u53bf\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u62a4\u6295\u8d44\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "findings": "\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u5dde\u7684PACE\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u519c\u7530\uff0c\u8d44\u91d1\u589e\u52a0\u4f7f\u4fdd\u62a4\u51b3\u7b56\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fdd\u62a4\u6295\u8d44\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u8d44\u91d1\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u519c\u7530\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u653f\u5e9c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u4fdd\u62a4\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c"}}

We leverage predicted\u00a0earliest pipeline connection time as a new instrumental variable to address the endogenous issue in cities&apos; pipeline connection time during the network expansion period. We find that cities&apos; real pipeline connections significantly reduced average air pollution by 8.5%. The magnitude is larger than the OLS estimation. Using the predicted IV and nationwide individual dataset from China Health Nutrition Survey (2000-2015), we also find the project improved residents&apos;\u00a0health in treated counties. The average individuals&apos; treatment costs decreased by around 4,200 yuan per year, and communities&apos; health scores were significantly improved.

Using smartphone geolocation data of truck drivers from 2019 to 2024, we construct a novel freight growth index (FGI) to quantify firms' freight activity in the Chinese stock market. We find that firms' freight growth is strongly associated with current operating performance and predicts future stock returns. A long-short portfolio sorted on FGI generates significant risk-adjusted monthly returns ranging from 57 to 72 basis points.

While the original work calibrated the model to S&amp;P 500 time series data, this paper extends the framework to option markets-a fundamentally distinct challenge due to market incompleteness stemming from non-tradable state variables. We develop a utility-based pricing approach that constructs a risk-adjusted measure via the dual solution of an optimal investment problem. The resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, though computationally formidable, is solved using a novel methodology enabling efficient calibration even on standard laptop hardware. Having done that, we look at the additional question to answer: whether the Marketron model, calibrated to market option prices, can simultaneously reproduce the statistical properties of the underlying asset's log-returns. We discuss our results in view of the long-standing challenge in quantitative finance of developing an unified framework capable of jointly capturing equity returns, option smile dynamics, and potentially volatility index behavior."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Marketron\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u671f\u6743\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "research_question": "Marketron\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u5230\u671f\u6743\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u540e\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u91cd\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\u8d44\u4ea7\u5bf9\u6570\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ea4\u6613\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u91d1\u878d\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u80a1\u7968\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u671f\u6743\u5fae\u7b11\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6307\u6570\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Marketron\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4ef7\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u6563\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u3001Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u6295\u8d44\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u89e3\u6784\u5efa\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3HJB\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6821\u51c6", "findings": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6821\u51c6", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55Marketron\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u80a1\u7968\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177"}}

A requirement for shared computing environments is a centralized identity system to authenticate and authorize user access. An organization's digital identity plane is a prime target for cyber threat actors. When compromised, identities can be exploited to steal credentials, create unauthorized accounts, and manipulate permissions-enabling attackers to gain control of the network and undermine its confidentiality, availability, and integrity. According to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), cybercrime losses reached a record of 16.6 B in the United States in 2024, a 33% increase from 2023. For organizations using Microsoft software, Active Directory is the on-premises identity system of choice. In this article, we examine the challenge of security compromises in Active Directory (AD) environments and present effective strategies to prevent credential theft and limit lateral movement by threat actors. These strategies include: 1) Active Directory Tiering-a method of logically segmenting the network into three tiers based on the sensitivity of the systems and data within each tier; 2) implementing the technical steps necessary to deploy AD Tiering; and 3) evaluating the benefits and potential trade-offs, such as setup time, hardware costs, ongoing maintenance, and required adjustments to business processes. Our proposed approaches aim to confine the movement of compromised credentials, preventing significant privilege escalation and theft. We argue that through our illustration of real-world scenarios, tiering can halt lateral movement and advanced cyber-attacks, thus reducing ransom escalation. Our work bridges a gap in existing literature by combining technical guidelines with theoretical arguments in support of tiering, positioning it as a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategy even though it cannot function in isolation. As the hardware advances and the cloud sourced services along with AI is advancing with unprecedented speed, we think it is important for security experts and the business to work together and start designing and developing software and frameworks to classify devices automatically and accurately within the tiered structure."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76Active Directory\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7AD\u5c42\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9632\u8303\u51ed\u8bc1\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u9650\u5236\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6a2a\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b9e\u65bd\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7Active Directory\u5c42\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u9632\u8303\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u9650\u5236\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8eab\u4efd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u6388\u6743\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u5e73\u9762\u6210\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u88ab\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51ed\u8bc1\u76d7\u7a83\u3001\u6743\u9650\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b49\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\u3002FBI\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a2024\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u7f51\u7edc\u72af\u7f6a\u635f\u5931\u8fbe\u5230166\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u540c\u6bd4\u589e\u957f33%\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u5c42\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6743\u9650\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u51ed\u8bc1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a2a\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u9632\u8303\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09Active Directory\u5c42\u5316-\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u903b\u8f91\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b2\uff09\u5b9e\u65bdAD\u5c42\u5316\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b3\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c42\u5316\u7684\u6548\u76ca\u4ee5\u53ca\u6210\u672c\u4ea4\u6613\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u642d\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u8c03\u6574\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "findings": "\u5c42\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u88ab\u7a81\u7834\u51ed\u8bc1\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u963b\u6b62\u6743\u9650\u5347\u7ea7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u76d7\u7a83\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u505c\u6b62\u6a2a\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u6765\u963b\u6b62\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d4d\u91d1\u654f\u8bc9\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u6307\u5357\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u8bba\u8bc1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f4d\u5c42\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u6218\u7565\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5b83\u4e0d\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528Microsoft Active Directory\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c42\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u65bd\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u90e8\u95e8\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u8bbe\u5907\u5230\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, empirical research on the pandemic\u2019s effects on housing cost burdens and their implications for aging in place among older households in South Korea remains limited. In this study, we developed a Housing Affordability Stress indicator to assess how housing affordability stress affected residential relocation among older South Korean homeowners. We differentiated between those with and without mortgages and examined various pandemic phases. We also analyzed investment and consumption motives in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) and non-SMA regions, which experienced different levels of housing price growth. The results indicate that older households with moderate housing affordability stress (spending 30\u201350% of income on housing) were significantly more likely to have moved in the past year. This likelihood was even higher among those with severe housing affordability stress (spending over 50%). The coefficients for the likelihood of moving decreased across pandemic phases; however, households with severe housing affordability stress continued to experience the highest housing instability. Additionally, older households without a mortgage were more likely to relocate than those with a mortgage.

We find that firms exposed to NIRP significantly reduce their short-term debt while increasing long-term debt, consistent with a strategy to lock in unusually low long-term rates. The shift in maturity structure is most pronounced among smaller, older, highly levered, and less liquid firms. While aggregate leverage remains stable in the short run, we observe a delayed increase in total debt levels when NIRP persists beyond five years. To interpret these findings, we develop two complementary frameworks. First, a stylised model highlights the role of refinancing frictions: because short-term debt requires frequent rollover, firms exposed to refinancing costs optimally shift toward longer-term debt under low-rate regimes. Second, a DSGE model calibrated to the Euro Area replicates the observed maturity reallocation and delayed leverage response via two channels. A compression in the long-term yield under NIRP (term structure channel) incentivises long-term borrowing, while the net worth effects from reserve-carry taxes (liquidity channel) suppress leverage initially unless the policy is gradual or sustained. Together, the stylised and quantitative models jointly rationalise our empirical findings and emphasise that the firm-level transmission of NIRP depends not only on the level of rates but also on the frequency of debt adjustment, balance sheet frictions, and the policy\u2019s anticipated duration. Our results highlight that while NIRP can reshape debt maturity composition rapidly, its effect on corporate leverage is contingent on the temporal design of the policy."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8d1f\u5229\u7387\u653f\u7b56\u4f7f\u4f01\u4e1a\u51cf\u5c11\u77ed\u671f\u503a\u52a1\u589e\u52a0\u957f\u671f\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u503a\u52a1\u5230\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u603b\u4f53\u503a\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u957f\u671f\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u4f1a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u5347", "research_question": "\u8d1f\u5229\u7387\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u8d1f\u5229\u7387\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u503a\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236", "theoretical_framework": "\u91cd\u878d\u8d44\u78d5\u788d\u7406\u8bba\u548cDSGE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7387\u671f\u9650\u7ed3\u6784\u6e20\u9053\u548d\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6e20\u9053\u89e3\u91ca\u653f\u7b56\u4f20\u5bfc", "method": "\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5(DiD)\u5206\u6790127\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u8fc758,000\u5bb6\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e", "findings": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728NIRP\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u77ed\u671f\u503a\u52a1\u589e\u52a0\u957f\u671f\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4f4e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4f01\u4e1a\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u503a\u52a1\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u957f\u671f\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u4f1a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u5347", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u878d\u8d44\u78d5\u788d\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u503a\u52a1\u5230\u671f\u8c03\u6574\u9891\u7387\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u78d5\u788d\u548d\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u4f20\u5bfc\u6e20\u9053", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d1f\u5229\u7387\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236"}}

We propose explainable information design in the context of information design with a continuous state space, restricting the information designer to use K-partitional signaling schemes defined by deterministic and monotone partitions of the state space, where a unique signal is sent for all states in each part. We first prove that the price of explainability (PoE)-the ratio between the performances of the optimal explainable signaling scheme and unrestricted signaling scheme-is exactly 1/2 in the worst case, meaning that partitional signaling schemes are never worse than arbitrary signaling schemes by a factor of 2. <br><br>We then study the complexity of computing optimal explainable signaling schemes. We show that the exact optimization problem is NP-hard in general. But for Lipschitz utility functions, an \u03b5-approximately optimal explainable signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time. And for piecewise constant utility functions, we provide an efficient algorithm to find an explainable signaling scheme that provides a 1/2 approximation to the optimal unrestricted signaling scheme, which matches the worst-case PoE bound.<br><br>A technical tool we develop is a conversion from any optimal signaling scheme (which satisfies a bi-pooling property) to a partitional signaling scheme that achieves 1/2 fraction of the expected utility of the former.

Using salary data from Capology and Spotrac and performance metrics from ESPN and the Premier League's official website, the analysis covers 1,276 players across three seasons. Nine linear regressions were conducted, both with and without team fixed effects, to identify performance metrics that significantly influence player wages. Results indicate that Passes Completed consistently exhibit a strong positive correlation with salaries for all outfield positions, while Minutes Played frequently shows a negative correlation. Position-specific findings reveal that Goals and Offsides are most economically significant for forwards, Assists for midfielders, and Saves for goalkeepers, whereas traditional defensive metrics such as Tackles Won, Interceptions, and Clearances show little wage relevance for defenders. The findings suggest that while certain performance indicators are valued in contract negotiations, many factors beyond on-field output likely contribute to salary determination in the EPL. This research contributes to the literature on sports economics by highlighting the limitations of performance-based pay models in professional football and pointing to the need for further investigation into non-performance determinants of player compensation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u82f1\u8d85\u8054\u8d5b\u7403\u5458\u85aa\u8d44\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7403\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u8fdb\u7403\u3001\u52a9\u653b\u548c\u6551\u7403\u7b49\u5177\u6709\u85aa\u8d44\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5b88\u6307\u6807\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u85aa\u8d44\u51b3\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u4e86\u591a\u91cd\u56e0\u7d20", "research_question": "\u82f1\u8d85\u8054\u8d5b\u7403\u5458\u85aa\u8d44\u4e0e\u573a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u54ea\u4e9b\u8868\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u85aa\u8d44\u51b3\u5b9a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7403\u5458\u85aa\u8d44\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f53\u80b2\uff0c\u5bf9\u8db3\u7403\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7403\u5458\u7684\u85aa\u8d44\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u57fa\u7845\u85aa\u8d44\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u7403\u5458\u85aa\u8d44\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5176\u573a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51b3\u5b9a", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u4e8eCapology\u3001Spotrac\u3001ESPN\u548c\u82f1\u8d85\u5b98\u7f51\uff0c\u8986\u76d62021/22\u81f32023/24\u8d5b\u5b63\u76841,276\u540d\u7403\u5458\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e5d\u6b21\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5305\u542b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u961f\u4f0d\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff09", "findings": "\u4f20\u7403\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u4e0a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u90fd\u4e0e\u85aa\u8d44\u5448\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u51fa\u573a\u65f6\u95f4\u7ecf\u5e38\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u524d\u950b\u7684\u8fdb\u7403\u548c\u8d8a\u4f4d\u6700\u5177\u7ecf\u6d4e\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u4e2d\u573a\u7684\u52a9\u653b\u6700\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u95e8\u5c06\u7684\u6551\u7403\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5b88\u6307\u6807\u5982\u62a2\u65ad\u3001\u62b6\u622a\u3001\u89e3\u56f4\u5bf9\u540e\u536b\u85aa\u8d44\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f53\u80b2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u57fa\u7845\u85aa\u8d44\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u82f1\u8d85\u85aa\u8d44\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7403\u961f\u7ba1\u7406\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u85aa\u8d44\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7845\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7403\u5458\u548c\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u7406\u89e3\u85aa\u8d44\u51b3\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d5b\u4e8b\u8d44\u672c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u53c2\u8003"}}

FD reduces financial frictions and hence allows small enterprises to access external finance. We find that FD always reduces inter-group inequality, whereas its impact on intra-group inequality depends on the levels of FD and trade costs. When trade costs are high, FD monotonically increases intra-group inequality. By contrast, when trade costs are low, the relationship between FD and intra-group inequality exhibits a U-shaped pattern. The results support empirical findings and clarify ambiguity in the literature.

The purpose of the study is to investigate how blockchain's immutable ledger can complement watermarking methods to provide robust proof of ownership, prevent unauthorized use, and enable transparent tracking of digital content distribution. The methodology involves a systematic analysis of existing watermarking algorithms combined with blockchain-based timestamping and registration frameworks. Key findings indicate that the hybrid approach significantly improves copyright protection by enabling verifiable, tamper-proof records of watermarked content, facilitating effective detection of counterfeit or altered media.

In this paper, we utilize mirror trade data from United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) to analyze global logistics and supply chains. In particular, we use the data to estimate: (1) Trade lead times, i.e., the length of time between the recording of the export at the source end and the corresponding import at the destination end, with international transport as the main component, and (2) Transshipment within transit blocs, wherein imports or exports to the destination country pass through another country within a customs-bonded transit bloc. Our estimates of trade lead time provide insights into the modes of transport and systematic shifts in lead times at both individual commodity and aggregate levels. The transshipment model identifies indirect sources of imports and enables reconstructing trade flow networks. Using the case study of UK and Western Europe imports from from Asia, we estimate the changes in aggregate trade lead times between 2018 and 2023, measure the Rotterdam Effect, and explore the impact of Brexit on transshipment patterns. We provide a practical tool for reducing import-export discrepancy in mirror trade data and tracking international trade lead times, key for trade and supply chain analysts. We show, for instance, the trade lead times have increased since 2022, consistent with proprietary data, which has clear implications for inventory management and supply chain risk management."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u5546\u54c1\u8d38\u6613\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u955c\u50cf\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u7269\u6d41\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u8d38\u6613\u524d\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8f6c\u8fd0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u955c\u50cf\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u7b97\u5168\u7403\u8d38\u6613\u524d\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u8fd0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u955c\u50cf\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d38\u6613\u4f19\u4f34\u53cc\u65b9\u5206\u522b\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8fdb\u51fa\u53e3\u5b98\u65b9\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u7269\u6d41\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u7edf\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u955c\u50cf\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u7269\u6d41\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8f6c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u5546\u54c1\u8d38\u6613\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5e93(UN Comtrade)\u7684\u955c\u50cf\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u7b97\u8d38\u6613\u524d\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u8fd0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "findings": "\u8d38\u6613\u524d\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea2022\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u6709\u6240\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8f6c\u8fd0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u4e86\u8d38\u6613\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u9e7f\u7279\u4e39\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u82f1\u56fd\u8131\u6b27\u5bf9\u8f6c\u8fd0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u955c\u50cf\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u7b97\u7269\u6d41\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u955c\u50cf\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u51fa\u53e3\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ffd\u8e2a\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u524d\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Using administrative panel data for all primary voucher schools from 2010-2014, we compare for-profit and nonprofit schools along inputs and student performance. For-profit schools serve more disadvantaged students and use lower-cost inputs, such as lessqualified teachers, but provide more instruction hours and smaller classes.

Given the interconnected nature of these challenges, which require governance approaches beyond the scope of individual institutions, this study examines whether normative developments are primarily shaped within institutional boundaries or through inter-institutional linkages. We analyse the full corpus of resolutions (1946-2024) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, Security Council, and Economic and Social Council, applying network analysis and natural language processing to trace citation patterns over time. Our findings show that intra-organ citation dominates, reflecting the distinct mandates and autonomy of each organ. Yet, structural and temporal patterns reveal significant inter-organ linkages that contribute to the emergence and diffusion of shared norms. These results provide new insights into the dynamics of norm development and the evolving anatomy of multilateral governance."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u4e09\u5927\u673a\u67841946-2024\u5e74\u51b3\u8bae\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u673a\u6784\u5185\u90e8\u5f15\u7528\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u8054\u7cfb\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e", "research_question": "\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u5728\u673a\u6784\u8fb9\u754c\u5185\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u8054\u7cfb\u5851\u9020\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6cbb\u7406\u5f15\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5168\u7403\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u601d\u60f3\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5982\u4f55\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e2a\u673a\u6784\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "theoretical_framework": "\u6cbb\u7406\u5f15\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u591a\u8fb9\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u5927\u4f1a\u3001\u5b89\u7406\u4f1a\u548c\u7ecf\u793e\u7406\u4e8b\u4f1a1946-2024\u5e74\u5168\u90e8\u51b3\u8bae\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f", "findings": "\u673a\u6784\u5185\u90e8\u5f15\u7528\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5404\u673a\u6784\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6388\u6743\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff1b\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u793a\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u8054\u7cfb\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u53d1\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u8fb9\u6cbb\u7406\u6f14\u53d8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5168\u7403\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u89c4\u8303\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u7ec4\u7ec7\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u5408\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49"}}

The secondary mortgage market provides a unique setting for evaluating the independence of mortgage performance from security design, with a focus on the motivation of issuers to diversify mortgage pools geographically and the ex post assignment of mortgage servicers to manage the security's mortgage pools. Using loan-level data from non-agency or private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and finding that RMBS performance is associated with the market structure of mortgage servicing is consistent with an ex post association between mortgages and mortgage securitization. This is distinct from concerns of moral hazard and non-random selection of mortgage origination or securitization.

The study adopts a survey research design to ascertain the effect of contingency factors on the financial sustainability of the pharmaceutical firms in Nigeria. The study gathered the data from 234 respondents out of a sample frame size of 330 from 10 largest firms in Nigeria. Multiple regression analysis revealed that leadership style (\u03b2 = 0.711; p &lt; 0.000); organization culture (\u03b2 = 0.185; p = 0.000) both has positive and notable effect on the financial sustainability efforts of the pharmaceutical firms in Nigeria.

Using quantile panel regressions, we find that an increase in the fiscal deficit is associated with a large and highly non-linear shift in the distribution of one year ahead inflation: that is, the right tail of inflation risk expands by more than average inflation. These effects are substantially larger in EMDEs than in advanced economies. We also show that this shift in the inflation distribution is closely related to a similar shift in the distribution of future currency depreciation.

Yet mounting ecological strain, social fragmentation, and institutional fatigue suggest that expansion cannot remain the sole marker of legitimacy in the twenty-first century. This article interrogates the growth imperative as a historically contingent construct rather than an inevitable trajectory, tracing how economic thought and managerial practice have institutionalized scale and speed as proxies for value. It then examines emerging alternatives such as slow growth, green growth, postgrowth, and degrowth, highlighting their potential and limitations in reframing organizational purpose. Building on systems thinking and regenerative leadership scholarship, the article advances the concept of regenerative transformation: a paradigm in which organizations are viewed as participants in living systems whose viability depends on reciprocity, sufficiency, and resilience. This perspective extends beyond disruption management and efficiency, emphasizing cultural transition, ecological integration, and expanded performance metrics that include trust, cohesion, and ecosystem health. A framework of regenerative indicators, including carbon equity, social investment ratios, and employee flourishing, illustrates how aligning measurement with intent reshapes accountability and value creation. By analyzing hypothetical yet plausible case signals, from firms prioritizing ecosystem restoration to policies embedding regenerative procurement, the article situates regenerative transformation as an emergent, though scattered, post-growth logic. It concludes that the future of business transformation will not be defined by the velocity of expansion but by the wisdom with which organizations align ambition with ecological and social thresholds."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u518d\u751f\u8f6c\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u957f\u7406\u5ff5\u8f6c\u5411\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u91cd\u89c6\u4e92\u60e0\u6027\u3001\u8db3\u591f\u6027\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u521b\u9020\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4ee5\u53cd\u601d\u589e\u957f\u5f0a\u5f0a\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u518d\u751f\u8f6c\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u538b\u529b\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u75b2\u52b3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee5\u589e\u957f\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u5df2\u4e0d\u9002\u5e9421\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u518d\u751f\u9886\u5bfc\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u7ec7\u89c6\u4e3a\u751f\u547d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e92\u60e0\u6027\u3001\u8db3\u591f\u6027\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u8ba8\u6162\u901f\u589e\u957f\u3001\u7eff\u8272\u589e\u957f\u3001\u540e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u53bb\u589e\u957f\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u518d\u751f\u8f6c\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "findings": "\u589e\u957f\u5f0a\u5f0a\u662f\u5386\u53f2\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u800c\u975e\u5fc5\u7136\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u518d\u751f\u8f6c\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u78b3\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u6295\u8d44\u6bd4\u548c\u5458\u5de5\u5174\u76db\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u91cd\u6784\u4ef7\u503c\u521b\u9020\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u518d\u751f\u8f6c\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u529f\u4ece\u6269\u5f20\u901f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u751f\u6001\u793e\u4f1a\u9608\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u667a\u6167\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u53d8\u9769\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u518d\u751f\u6307\u6807\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91cd\u6784\u4ef7\u503c\u521b\u9020\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

This problem involves a number of supply and warehouse nodes, and a large set of customers with heterogeneous service and operational requirements. We formulate it as a mixed-integer program, which can be seen as a variant of network design problems. Existing off-the-shelf solvers struggle to obtain high-quality solutions within a reasonable time limit due to the service constraints, complex operational requirements, and the problem size. To address the idiosyncrasies of service constraints, we exploit the block-angular structure of the MIP formulation and develop a column-generation-based decomposition algorithm to utilize customer-oriented subproblems with personalized service constraints. Various reformulations and necessary strategies are introduced to accelerate the vanilla method and improve solution quality. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-optimal solutions within an average absolute gap of 0.70% while reducing computation time by 73% compared to state-of-the-art solvers. An ablation study is conducted to analyze the impact of different reformulations, network scales, constraint configurations, and solution strategies."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5217\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u670d\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8003\u8651\u5f02\u6784\u670d\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u8425\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8ba2\u5355\u5c65\u884c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7269\u6d41\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u670d\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5217\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5217\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9762\u5411\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "findings": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u57470.70%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u5dee\u8ddd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u51cf\u5c1173%\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u670d\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5217\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7269\u6d41\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

I develop a structural model incorporating covenants and find that they allow for 4.7% higher aggregate investment relative to a no-covenants baseline. While covenants are beneficial overall, the model also reveals costs faced by firms attempting to avoid covenant violations. In two applications of the model, I find that, first, the transmission of aggregate shocks to firm financing crucially depends on firms' efforts to avoid covenant violations. Second, the model shows that earnings-based covenants allow for higher investment in industries with low asset pledgeability but offer no advantage when assets can be easily pledged."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u91d1\u878d\u5951\u7ea6\u6761\u6b3e\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6295\u8d44\uff08\u6bd4\u65e0\u5951\u7ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad84.7%\uff09\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u4f46\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u907f\u514d\u8fdd\u7ea6\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fdd\u7ea6\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u5bf9\u51b2\u51fb\u4f20\u5bfc\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u76ca\u578b\u5951\u7ea6\u5728\u8d44\u4ea7\u53ef\u62b5\u62bc\u6027\u4f4e\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "research_question": "\u91d1\u878d\u5951\u7ea6\u6761\u6b3e\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u6295\u8d44\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91d1\u878d\u5951\u7ea6\u6761\u6b3e\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6295\u8d44\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u603b\u4f53\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6210\u672c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91d1\u878d\u5951\u7ea6\u6761\u6b3e\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5951\u7ea6\u6761\u6b3e\u5bf9\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u5951\u7ea6\u6761\u6b3e\u4f7f\u603b\u4f53\u6295\u8d44\u6bd4\u65e0\u5951\u7ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad84.7%\uff1b\u907f\u514d\u8fdd\u7ea6\u6709\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u907f\u514d\u8fdd\u7ea6\u52aa\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u51b2\u51fb\u4f20\u5bfc\uff1b\u6536\u76ca\u578b\u5951\u7ea6\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u4ea7\u53ef\u62b5\u62bc\u6027\u884c\u4e1a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u5951\u7ea6\u6761\u6b3e\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53cc\u91cd\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u5e26\u6765\u6210\u672c\uff09\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d37\u6b3e\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5951\u7ea6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff08\u5982\u6536\u76ca\u578b\u5951\u7ea6\u5728\u4f4e\u62b5\u62bc\u6027\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff09\u3002"}}

This study observes that, while the United States adopts a parallel investigation model, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) conduct independent yet coordinated proceedings, Singapore employs a joint investigation framework integrating the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) to ensure procedural fairness and transparency. By contrast, India centralizes investigative, adjudicative, and prosecutorial powers within the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), a model that raises concerns regarding functional overlap, procedural efficiency, and the perception of impartiality. Drawing on statutory provisions, case law, regulatory manuals, and policy reports, this study identifies the critical enforcement gaps in India's current framework. Emphasis is placed on the evidentiary standard required to establish violations, absence of structured inter-agency cooperation, and limited adoption of global enforcement best practices. The analysis situates these shortcomings against the principles of credible deterrence articulated by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), arguing that without institutional separation of functions and strengthened coordination between civil and criminal enforcement authorities, India's capacity to address market misconduct will remain constrained. The paper concludes with a set of targeted reform proposals designed to enhance enforcement efficiency, align domestic practices with IOSCO benchmarks, and strengthen market integrity through credible and transparent regulatory actions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5370\u5ea6\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u7684\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f8e\u56fd\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u800c\u5370\u5ea6\u5c06\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u88c1\u51b3\u548c\u8d77\u8bc9\u6743\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728SEBI\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6267\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u8bda\u4fe1\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u5ea6\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6743\u529b\u5206\u914d\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u548c\u673a\u6784\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5370\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5370\u5ea6\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6267\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bc1\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u5408\u4f5c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u7403\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u91c7\u7eb3\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "theoretical_framework": "\u56fd\u9645\u8bc1\u5238\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7(IOSCO)\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5a01\u6151\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u673a\u6784\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u6c11\u4e8b\u5211\u4e8b\u6267\u6cd5\u673a\u6784\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u89c4\u6761\u6b3e\u3001\u5224\u4f8b\u6cd5\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u624b\u518c\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u6cd5", "findings": "\u7f8e\u56fdSEC\u548cDOJ\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u65b0\u52a0\u5761MAS\u548cCAD\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5370\u5ea6SEBI\u96c6\u4e2d\u6743\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bc1\u5238\u6267\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9IOSCO\u53ef\u4fe1\u5a01\u6151\u539f\u5219\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7406\u89e3", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6267\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u6807\u51c6\u63a5\u8f68\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u4fe1\u900f\u660e\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u52a8\u52a0\u5f3a\u5e02\u573a\u8bda\u4fe1"}}

The company's aggressive marketing claims that rock salt provides cardiovascular and digestive benefits, supported by apparent academic validation, illustrate how predatory publishing enables commercial health misinformation. Critical examination of the cited research reveals systematic scientific failures including complete absence of empirical methodology, therapeutic claims directly contradicting established medical evidence, editorial quality consistent with predatory publishing practices, and violations of regulatory standards governing health claims. The case demonstrates how academically-appearing publications from predatory journals create pathways for unsubstantiated health claims to reach consumers through commercial advertising, potentially causing public health harm through treatment delays and medical non-compliance.

Accurate insights into emission dynamics are essential for developing targeted mitigation strategies. This study uses Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) to examine the drivers and inhibitors of Germany\u2019s GHG emissions from 1996 to 2022, utilizing the newly developed Python tool TOAD (Trade-Oriented Analysis through Decomposition). TOAD applies the Dietzenbacher and Los (1998) method across four accounting schemes: Territorial-based (TBE), Consumption-based (CBE), Production-based (PBE) and Balanced Emissions (BE). The results show that the Activity Effect is the dominant driver under the TBE scheme, contributing approximately +309 Mt CO2-eq., while the Emission Intensity Effect emerges as the most significant mitigating factor, reducing emissions by around \u2212617 Mt CO2-eq. The Activity Effect captures changes in the scale of final demand, whereas the Emission Intensity Effect reflects changes in the amount of emissions per unit of output. Under the BE perspective, however, the net reduction amounts to only -38 Mt CO2-eq., as increased emissions embodied in imports (+132 Mt CO2-eq.) offset much of the domestic efficiency gains. Trade-related outsourcing of emissions, particularly through intermediate and final goods, plays a substantial role in shaping Germany\u2019s GHG footprint.

Although these features move platforms beyond static interfaces with predefined workflows, whether enabling dynamic, conversational interactions improves supply chain decisions remains unclear. This research investigates if access to LLM-aided optimization affects individual decision-making in a stochastic supply chain network design problem. Methodology/results: We designed an interactive LLM-based framework with external optimization capabilities to conduct a behavioral lab experiment. In Part 1 of the experiment, participants select suppliers and production sites under disruption risk. The treatment group has access to the LLM-optimization decision support, while the control group completes the task without this aid. In Part 2, we provide all non-dominated solutions, i.e., decisions that maximize expected profit for a given risk level, and elicit individuals' context-specific risk-reward preferences to assess alignment with their prior decisions. Despite providing all participants with the normative optimal solution in Part 1, chat access increases the likelihood of selecting higher performing solutions. Moreover, comparisons between Part 1 and 2 solutions uncover systematic deviations between groups: participants without chat access tend to undershoot their preferences, settling for suboptimal decisions that sacrifice profit at a given risk. Interestingly, participants with chat access frequently overshoot, taking on more risk than intended in favor of higher expected returns. Overall, chat access attenuates the influence of participants' risk preferences on Part 1 solutions. Managerial implications: LLMs can democratize optimization by improving the interpretability of complex supply chain solutions for non-experts. However, solving problems through interactive chat can lead managers to focus on profit-driven queries, leading to outcomes that increase risk beyond organizational preferences. Thus, organizations must make deliberate, behaviorally-driven design choices when deploying LLM-driven optimization, to ensure decision outcomes align with their risk preferences."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a5\u5165LLM\u4f18\u5316\u652f\u6301\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u627f\u62c5\u8d85\u51fa\u9884\u671f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u8bbe\u8ba1LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u754c\u9762\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u679c\u7b26\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u3002", "research_question": "\u63a5\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8f85\u52a9\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u968f\u673a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u6b63\u5728\u5c06LLM\u529f\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u6539\u5584\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u51b3\u7b56\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u884c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f18\u5316\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u6240\u6709\u975e\u652f\u914d\u89e3\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669-\u56de\u62a5\u504f\u597d\u3002", "findings": "1) \u804a\u5929\u63a5\u5165\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ee9\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1b2) \u65e0\u804a\u5929\u63a5\u5165\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f4e\u4f30\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u63a5\u53d7\u6b21\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b3) \u6709\u804a\u5929\u63a5\u5165\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7ecf\u5e38\u8d85\u8c03\uff0c\u627f\u62c5\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4ee5\u6362\u53d6\u66f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\uff1b4) \u804a\u5929\u63a5\u5165\u51cf\u5f31\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "1) \u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2) \u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u804a\u5929\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u8d85\u8c03\u73b0\u8c61\uff09\uff1b3) \u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "1) LLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b2) \u63d0\u9192\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u8981\u505a\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u679c\u7b26\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\uff1b3) \u4e3aLLM\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that due to this limitation, the Cayman Islands functions as a strategic, cost-effective jurisdiction for augmenting patent protection initially obtained elsewhere. Our research provides the first comprehensive analysis of Caymanian patents, and through a quantitative examination of patent family data-including filing trends, economic valuation, geographic distribution, and assignee profiles-we find strong empirical evidence to support this thesis. Our findings reveal a disproportionate presence of high-value patent families in the Cayman Islands, particularly within the pharmaceutical and telecommunications sectors. This concentration aligns with the jurisdiction's specific economic characteristics, such as its medical tourism industry and high per capita income, as well as the established international strategies of major pharmaceutical companies. The analysis demonstrates that patent registration in the Cayman Islands is a distinct, specialized function that complements its broader role in global finance and law, offering tailored, low-cost domestic IP rights within a globally oriented portfolio. This study provides a benchmark for how other small jurisdictions can successfully navigate and compete in the global legal market through a specialized approach to intellectual property."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u66fc\u7fa4\u5c9b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u9886\u57df\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u6cd5\u5f8b\u670d\u52a1\u51fa\u53e3\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5374\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e13\u5229\u4fdd\u62a4\u8865\u5145\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u533b\u836f\u548c\u7535\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u4e13\u5229\u5bb6\u65cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "research_question": "\u5f00\u66fc\u7fa4\u5c9b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e13\u5229\u4fdd\u62a4\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u56fd\u5185\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6218\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u4f18\u5316\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f00\u66fc\u7fa4\u5c9b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u670d\u52a1\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5176\u4e13\u5229\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u56fd\u5185\u6027\u8d28\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u53d1\u6325\u6218\u7565\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u5168\u7403\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4e13\u5229\u6218\u7565\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5c0f\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4e13\u5229\u5bb6\u65cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7533\u8bf7\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f30\u503c\u3001\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6743\u5229\u4eba\u6982\u51b5", "findings": "\u5f00\u66fc\u7fa4\u5c9b\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u4e13\u5229\u5bb6\u65cf\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u836f\u548c\u7535\u4fe1\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u533b\u7597\u65c5\u6e38\u4ea7\u4e1a\u548c\u9ad8\u4eba\u5747\u6536\u5165\u7b49\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u7b26", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c0f\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u5168\u7403\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u5168\u7403\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fb9\u754c", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u5c0f\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u4e0e\u5168\u7403\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f"}}

We consider mobility as movement captured by changes in status between parents and children. We provide estimates of overall mobility, which involves mobility during transition to a system's steady state, as well as steady state mobility, which captures long-run mobility independent of transitional dynamics or shifts in the marginal distribution of outcomes across generations. We further decompose overall mobility into structural and exchange components. We find that China exhibits more overall educational mobility than Russia mostly due to greater structural mobility, while Russia exhibits greater steady state educational mobility. In contrast, both the overall and steady state occupational mobility is similar in China and Russia. Comparing these results to the US, we find that steady state mobility in education is substantially higher in the US and Russia compared to China, but occupational steady state mobility is comparable in all three countries."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5728\u8f6c\u578b\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7a33\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e24\u56fd\u804c\u4e1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u7a33\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6700\u9ad8", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5728\u4ece\u8ba1\u5212\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5411\u5e02\u573a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u578b\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f6c\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u7a33\u6001\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6e21\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u533a\u5206", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7684\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u603b\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4", "findings": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u6559\u80b2\u603b\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7a33\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\uff0c\u4e24\u56fd\u804c\u4e1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u7a33\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6700\u9ad8", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6848\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u8f6c\u578b\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u6001\u6d41\u52a8\u6027", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u5173\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8f6c\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd"}}

However, such behavior often unfolds in social contexts, where expectations about others' behavior may shape moral decision-making. This study investigates how beliefs about descriptive norms influence strategic ignorance in a modified moral wiggleroom game. Participants first predicted how often others acquired information, then received randomly assigned feedback indicating high or low rates of ignorance before making their own decision as the dictator. Individuals were more likely to seek information when told that most others typically did so, and more likely to avoid information when told that ignorance was common. Norm-conforming behavior differed between ignorance expectants-those who expected ignorance and reveal expectants-those who expected information acquisition. Ignorance expectants adjusted only when norm cues strongly contradicted their prior beliefs, whereas reveal expectants exhibited modest but consistent responsiveness across norm environments. There is no evidence of ex-ante self-serving belief distortion, though limited behavioral change constrained opportunities to test for ex-post justification. These findings suggest that strategic ignorance responds to descriptive norms, but not through motivated belief distortion."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u4ed6\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f53\u88ab\u544a\u77e5\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u4f1a\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfb\u6c42\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5f53\u88ab\u544a\u77e5\u65e0\u77e5\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\u65f6\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u671f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u4fe1\u5ff5\u626d\u66f2\u3002", "research_question": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9053\u5fb7\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u6027\u65e0\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4eba\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u4e3a\u81ea\u79c1\u884c\u4e3a\u8fa9\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u9884\u671f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u9053\u5fb7\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6218\u7565\u6027\u65e0\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u4fee\u6539\u7248\u9053\u5fb7\u6447\u6446\u7a7a\u95f4\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5148\u9884\u6d4b\u4ed6\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63a5\u6536\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u7684\u9ad8/\u4f4e\u65e0\u77e5\u7387\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u88c1\u8005\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56", "findings": "\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u88ab\u544a\u77e5\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfb\u6c42\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u88ab\u544a\u77e5\u65e0\u77e5\u5e38\u89c1\u65f6\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u65e0\u77e5\u9884\u671f\u8005\u548c\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u671f\u8005\u5bf9\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8b\u524d\u81ea\u6211\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u626d\u66f2\u8bc1\u636e", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u6218\u7565\u6027\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u4fe1\u5ff5\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u51cf\u5c11\u6218\u7565\u6027\u65e0\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883"}}

This chapter discusses the economic impact of tax havens that goes beyond a zero-sum transfer of the tax base, what we label real effects. We review the literature and focus on exploring how profit shifting affects employment, investment, and innovation in firms. We consider in turn how real effects shape market structure and their implications in general equilibrium. In conclusion, we propose some potential pathways for future research in terms of methodology and areas that we deem promising for further exploration."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7a0e\u6536\u8f6c\u79fb\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u6da6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u771f\u5b9e\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\u9664\u4e86\u7a0e\u6536\u8f6c\u79fb\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fd8\u6709\u54ea\u4e9b\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f\u5229\u6da6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u6d3b\u52a8\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u5c06\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7a0e\u533a\u5411\u4f4e\u7a0e\u533a\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u7a0e\u6536\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u540e\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5229\u6da6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u548c\u8bc4\u8ff0\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\u771f\u5b9e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u732e\u3002", "findings": "\u5229\u6da6\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0e\u6536\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5747\u8861\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u7a0e\u6536\u8f6c\u79fb\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u5e94\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4f01\u4e1a\u5168\u7403\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u7a0e\u6536\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

We argue that macro outcomes following a depreciation event depend on the joint distribution of (i) firm foreign currency exposures and (ii) firm marginal propensities to invest, which can be higher for these SMEs. We characterize macro dynamics in this setting using a model in which firms face idiosyncratic profitability risk, liquidity constraints, and foreign currency debt revaluations. Calibrating our model to micro data from Peru, we find that depreciations are costlier than in a model that considers the exposure of a representative large firm. We conclude that exposures of SMEs to debt revaluations are an important macroeconomic channel for currency devaluations.&nbsp;"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u94f6\u884c\u8d27\u5e01\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d27\u5e01\u8dcc\u503c\u5bf9\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u6bd4\u5927\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "research_question": "\u94f6\u884c\u8d27\u5e01\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u9650\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5728\u9650\u5236\u94f6\u884c\u8d27\u5e01\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u96be\u9009\u62e9\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u94f6\u884c\u6301\u6709\u8d27\u5e01\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u76db\u5229\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5916\u5e01\u503a\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5bc6\u9c81\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f01\u4e1a\u5916\u5e01\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u503f\u503e\u7684\u805a\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "findings": "\u8d27\u5e01\u8dcc\u503c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5927\u4f01\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u4f30\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u5916\u5e01\u66b4\u9732\u4e0e\u8fb9\u9645\u6295\u8d44\u503f\u503e\u7684\u805a\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u4f4e\u4f30\u5b8f\u89c2\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u94f6\u884c\u8d27\u5e01\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d27\u5e01\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u542b\u4e49\u3002"}}

It finds that it attenuates the effect of monetary policy: credit growth is less affected by changes in policy rates in the presence of interconnectedness. The latter is more salient in the case of credit provided by banks to the aggregate private non-financial sector and households individually. Additionally, both the interconnections between banks and non-banks, as well as between both sectors, are important. For this purpose, the paper relies on measures of intra-financial assets, which are determined, for banks and non-banks and in a large sample of European countries, using consolidated and non-consolidated financial account data. These measures uncover significant changes in the structure of these positions: on the one hand, there was a notable increase of intra-financial assets among the non-bank financial sectors and between the latter and banks while, on the other hand, intra-financial positions of banks have progressively declined since the Global Financial Crisis, in line with the reduction in intra-bank activity and the deleveraging efforts of the sector."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u5f31\u5316\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u4f20\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u653f\u7b56\u5229\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u4fe1\u8d37\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u94f6\u884c\u5411\u79c1\u8425\u975e\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4fe1\u8d37\u3002\u94f6\u884c\u4e0e\u975e\u94f6\u884c\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u90fd\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u4f20\u5bfc\u548c\u5411\u975e\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u4fe1\u8d37\u63d0\u4f9b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u5bf9\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u91d1\u878d\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3001\u4fe1\u8d37\u4f9b\u7ed9\u6e20\u9053\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6b27\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u4e0e\u975e\u5408\u5e76\u8d22\u52a1\u8d26\u6237\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u975e\u94f6\u884c\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u91d1\u878d\u8d44\u4ea7\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u5bf9\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "findings": "\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u5f31\u5316\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u4fe1\u8d37\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u94f6\u884c\u5411\u79c1\u8425\u975e\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u4fe1\u8d37\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u94f6\u884c\u4e0e\u975e\u94f6\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8054\u7edc\u90fd\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u540e\u94f6\u884c\u5185\u90e8\u8d44\u4ea7\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u975e\u94f6\u884c\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u5185\u90e8\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u94f6\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u5bf9\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u4f20\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7edc\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5173\u6ce8\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u653f\u7b56\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper develops a game-theoretic model to study these questions, explicitly accounting not only for the classic make-or-buy decision but also the possibility for firms to adopt a \"make-and-sell\" strategy by supplying inputs to other downstream firms. Specifically, we consider an environment where downstream firms require a common input but differ in their ideal input characteristics. In this setting, outsourcing decisions involve a trade-off between specialization and economies of scale, departing from the traditional view that the two are inherently linked. The trade-off arises because if several firms produce in-house, inputs are better tailored to the specific needs, but scale economies are left unexploited. The resulting industry structure emerges endogenously from firms' strategic production and sourcing decisions. Our analysis shows that a pure input supplier can be active in equilibrium, even though it offers neither technological nor competitive advantages. The reason is that it better balances the need for specialized inputs and the gains from economies of scale than downstream firms. We also find that the pure supplier\u2019s payoff is non-monotonic in its bargaining power, and characterize conditions under which the resulting industry structures are efficient. Our results are robust to various extensions, including economies of scope in production. \n<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0b\u6e38\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u5916\u5305\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff1a\u81ea\u5236\u3001\u4ece\u7eaf\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u6216\u4ece\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6295\u5165\u54c1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u8d2d\u4e70\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7eaf\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5747\u8861\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6216\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e0b\u6e38\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u51fa\u5916\u5305\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u5236\u3001\u4ece\u7eaf\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ece\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u6295\u5165\u54c1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u8d2d\u4e70\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6218\u7565\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5916\u5305\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u662f\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4f01\u4e1a\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u6743\u8861\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0b\u6e38\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u6295\u5165\u54c1\u751f\u4ea7\u6216\u670d\u52a1\u5916\u5305\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e0b\u6e38\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u5171\u540c\u6295\u5165\u54c1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4f46\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5185\u751f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "findings": "\u7eaf\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5747\u8861\u4e2d\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6216\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u7eaf\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u4e0e\u5176\u8bae\u4ef7\u80fd\u529b\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6743\u8861\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7eaf\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5916\u5305\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We distinguish between four different perspectives: (1) institutions as shared mental models that guide interpretation and behavior (Denzau and North); (2) institutions as environmental heuristics that support task performance under cognitive limitations (Gigerenzer); (3) institutions as social technologies that facilitate the division of knowledge and cooperation (Hayek); and (4) institutions as enacted practices constitutive of economic action, rooted in 4E cognition theories (Gallagher). These four conceptions are complementary for applied research, because they recognize different epistemic and economic functions of institutions. But theoretically these perspectives are only partially compatible, because of their differing cognitive underpinnings-ranging from internalist to external and enactivist views. We argue that there are several reasons to move beyond internalism (also called cognitivism) which implies that institutions are primarily relevant as aids to the individual mind. Accounts rooted in externalist (also called the external mind) are more compatible with institutional economics, and an economics which recognizes the relevance of fundamental uncertainty. In such accounts institutions are not merely rules or heuristics as is commonly assumed but come to occupy a central epistemic role as points of orientation and generators of knowledge.

It begins by outlining the mechanics of LBOs, highlighting their reliance on high debt financing secured by the target company's assets and cash flows, and the role of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in structuring transactions. The discussion integrates multiple theoretical lenses-agency theory, free cash flow hypothesis, capital structure theory, and behavioral finance-to explain the motivations, governance implications, and potential pitfalls of LBOs. Historical milestones, including the rise of mega-deals in the U.S. and U.K., the post-2008 slowdown, and the resurgence in the 2010s, are juxtaposed with India's gradual adoption, shaped by regulatory constraints, evolving debt markets, and private credit growth. The article analyzes value drivers such as tax shields, operational discipline, and concentrated ownership, alongside risks from over-leverage, debt overhang, and market cyclicality. It also compares regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions, detailing the influence of takeover codes, disclosure norms, and capital market depth on deal feasibility. Contemporary trends such as ESG-linked financing, technology-enabled due diligence, and increased private equity involvement are assessed for their impact on future LBO activity. A series of global and Indian case studies illustrates varied deal structures, outcomes, and stakeholder effects. Policy recommendations emphasize the need for transparency, minority shareholder protection, and prudent leverage management. By combining academic theory with market practice and jurisdictional analysis, the article offers a holistic reference for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to understand the strategic and economic significance of LBOs in an evolving financial landscape."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6760\u6746\u6536\u8d2d\uff08LBOs\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6218\u7565\u7406\u7531\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u6267\u884c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63ed\u793aLBOs\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u8005\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u52a1\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7efc\u5408\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "research_question": "\u6760\u6746\u6536\u8d2d\uff08LBOs\uff09\u5728\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u6267\u884c\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u521b\u9020\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u76d1\u7ba1\u73af\u5883\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u6210\u6548\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5b66\u672f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u5b9e\u8df5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u7406\u89e3LBOs\u7684\u6218\u7565\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u52a1\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5728\u65f6\u4ee3\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ee3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u73b0\u91d1\u6d41\u5047\u8bfa\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u5b66", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u5206\u6790\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u6848\u4f8b\uff09", "findings": "LBOs\u4f9d\u9760\u9ad8\u503a\u52a1\u878d\u8d44\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0e\u6536\u76fe\u5f69\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u7eaa\u5f8b\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u624b\u6307\u63a7\u5236\u521b\u9020\u4ef7\u503a\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6760\u6746\u3001\u503a\u52a1\u538b\u529b\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u76d1\u7ba1\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea4\u6613\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5f53\u4ee3\u8d8b\u52bf\u5982ESG\u878d\u8d44\u3001\u79d1\u6280\u5c3e\u8c03\u548c\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u4f5c\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6574\u5408\u591a\u91cd\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u89e3\u91caLBOs\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u542b\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u6613\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u52a1\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u5c11\u6570\u80a1\u4e1c\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u8c28\u614e\u6760\u6746\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The primary objective of this study is to find out the changes of land use/land cover (LU/LC), assess its drivers, magnitude and implication for land management over thirty years (1994-2024) in the Upper Nile Basin. The methods used for this research were GIS techniques; field assessment, household survey, key informant interview, and focal group discussion. The land use/land cover change analysis for the year of 1994, 2004, 2014 and 2024 were conducted using both supervised and unsupervised maximum likelihood image classification was employed in combination with the visual interpretation of satellite images to categories and map LULC classes of the study landscape maximum likelihoods classifier technique. The study analysis indicated that five types of land use types were identified, these are cultivated land, forest land, grassland, built-up mainly settlement and water bodies. The analysis indicated that cultivated and settlement increased by 21.68% and 130.6%, respectively. On the other hand, forest land and grassland decreased by 12.9% and -9.63%, respectively, but the water body is constant throughout the study periods. The change was primarily due to expansion of cultivated land and built-up area by gaining lands from forest and grassland. The output suggests that there is a significant increase in cultivation land and urbanization with the expense of decreasing of forest land and grassland. Agricultural activities and settlements were showing radical increment in gentle slope areas while the remnant forest left in high altitude areas.

Using a classical event-study approach and Fama-French five-factor models, we analyze daily stock price reactions to Western policy announcements and Chinese EV product launches. Results show that Chinese product launches tend to negatively impact global competitors, highlighting their growing market power. In response, Western trade policies cause immediate, statistically significant losses for Chinese EV firms, though they have limited positive effects on Western companies. The findings suggest that while protectionist policies can weaken foreign rivals, relieving competitive pressure, they do not necessarily lead to appreciable gains in expected profits for domestic incumbents."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u897f\u65b9\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u4ea7\u54c1\u53d1\u5e03\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u80a1\u5e02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e3b\u4e49\u653f\u7b56\u867d\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ed9\u897f\u65b9\u516c\u53f8\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u76c8\u5229\u3002", "research_question": "\u897f\u65b9\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u7403\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020\u5546\u4e0e\u897f\u65b9\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u5168\u7403\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5feb\u901f\u5360\u9886\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u897f\u65b9\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u8d38\u6613\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5(Event-study approach)\u3001Fama-French\u4e94\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e5\u5ea6\u80a1\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u897f\u65b9\u653f\u7b56\u516c\u544a\u548c\u4e2d\u56fdEV\u4ea7\u54c1\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u80a1\u4ef7\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c", "findings": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u4ea7\u54c1\u53d1\u5e03\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u897f\u65b9\u8d38\u6613\u653f\u7b56\u7acb\u5373\u9020\u6210\u4e2d\u56fdEV\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u897f\u65b9\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6b63\u9762\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u8d38\u6613\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5316\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e3b\u4e49\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u8d38\u6613\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7406\u89e3\u5168\u7403\u653f\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5f71\u54cd"}}

Evidence suggests gains in AI-specific human capital but possible losses in traditional human capital, highlighting benefits and costs AI may impose on future workforce productivity."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f4e\u5206\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u538b\u7f29\u4e86\u6210\u7ee9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6210\u7ee9\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u4e86AI\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "research_question": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u8868\u73b0\uff1f\u5bf9\u5c06\u6765\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u6709\u4f55\u5229\u5f0a\uff1f", "motivation": "AI\u5728\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u91cd\u5b9a\u4e49\u672a\u6765\u52b3\u52a8\u8005\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u5bf9\u5b66\u672f\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u542f\u793a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u8865\u5076\u6027\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u9876\u5c16\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u5b66\u751f-\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83ChatGPT\u63a8\u51fa\u524d\u540e\u4e0d\u540cAI\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u6210\u7ee9\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "AI\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u603b\u4f53\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f4e\u5206\u5b66\u751f\u83b7\u76ca\u66f4\u591a\uff1b\u6210\u7ee9\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u51cf\u5f31\u4e86\u6210\u7ee9\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5b66\u751f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86AI\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u5bf9\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\u5b66\u672f\u8868\u73b0\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eAI\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u4eba\u624d\u9009\u62e4\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Despite the abundance of literature and frameworks for major multinational businesses, a notable deficiency remains in the application of these models to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), especially in emerging economies. These firms, essential to their national economies and pivotal for attaining global sustainability objectives, encounter distinct challenges including resource limitations, knowledge deficiencies, and the necessity of emphasizing short-term economic growth.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  This research presents a pragmatic, incremental methodology to address this disparity. The framework, named the Phased ESG Integration Model for Emerging Market SMEs, is a systematic, three-phase methodology intended to be scalable and implementable. The process commences with a Foundational Assessment, when subject matter experts perform a streamlined materiality analysis to synchronize ESG priorities with fundamental business strategy and stakeholder expectations. Subsequently, Operational Integration emphasizes the execution of high-impact, low-cost \"quick wins\" that yield immediate financial benefits, thus alleviating the challenge of short-term financial constraints. The last step, Measurement, Reporting, and Value Creation, assists SMEs in formulating straightforward key performance indicators and transparent reporting to unveil new prospects, including access to specialized sustainable finance.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  The approach is based on the premise that a supportive ecosystem is crucial for its success. The document emphasizes the essential functions of governments, financial institutions, and major enterprises in delivering specific incentives, customized finance, and capacity-building resources. Case studies from emerging economies, such as Qatar and Colombia, demonstrate how this multi-stakeholder partnership can convert the theoretical necessity of ESG into concrete economic and social advantages. The model offers a practical solution to the distinct issues faced by emerging economies, delineating a clear framework for SMEs to integrate sustainability into their financial decision-making, bolster resilience, and promote inclusive, long-term economic development.\n </div>\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684ESG\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u62a5\u544a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u65b9\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684ESG\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u7b49\u7279\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1ESG\u539f\u5219\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u4f01\u4e1a\u6218\u7565\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5927\u578b\u591a\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728ESG\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u5168\u7403\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u652f\u6301\u6027\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e8eESG\u6210\u529f\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u653f\u5e9c\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u548c\u5927\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff09\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u96c6\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5b9e\u65bd\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\"\u5feb\u901f\u80dc\u5229\"\u9879\u76ee\uff09\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u521b\u9020\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5236\u5b9a\u7b80\u6d01KPI\u548c\u900f\u660e\u62a5\u544a\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u5982\u5361\u5854\u5c14\u548c\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u65b9\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06ESG\u7406\u8bba\u9700\u6c42\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u653f\u7b56\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709ESG\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fdb\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c2\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u4f01\u4e1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684ESG\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5176\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u653f\u5e9c\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u7b49\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1aESG\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

We consider contexts in which allows individuals choose among three options: full learning, partial learning, or no learning of the majority language. The key innovation in our approach is the introduction of a conformity factor in language acquisition, where peer pressure and community status may outweigh communicative and economic incentives for some individuals. Notably, we identify a non-monotonic relationship between the level of conformity and the distribution of full learners, partial learners, and nonlearners in equilibrium. This finding is significant for policy considerations, as small adjustments in language acquisition costs may unpredictably influence language acquisition patterns across minority groups."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4ece\u4f17\u56e0\u7d20\u8003\u5bdf\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4f17\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u653f\u7b56\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "research_question": "\u591a\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u4f17\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4f53\u5bf9\u591a\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u5b8c\u5168\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u4ece\u4f17\u538b\u529b\u548c\u793e\u533a\u5730\u4f4d\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4ece\u4f17\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u8651\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ece\u4f17\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "findings": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4f17\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u548c\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5c0f\u5e45\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u4ece\u4f17\u56e0\u7d20\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u5f97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u610f\u60f3\u4e0d\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u52a0\u8c28\u614e\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u653f\u7b56\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

The computed index captures events of high uncertainty mainly triggered by events of economic distress in Pakistan, such as the high probability of sovereign default in April 2023. It also captures political and climate related events such as the ouster of the former prime minister Imran Khan in April 2022, and the devastating floods of July 2022. We test the information content of the computed index using a structural vector autoregression model, and find that it has a significant effect on macroeconomic variables of Pakistan's economy after controlling for important events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of 2024, over 80% of enterprises globally deploy AI across core business processes (McKinsey Global Survey, 2024), and AI integration into public services and education is accelerating rapidly (OECD AI Policy Observatory, 2023). This pervasive adoption has made AI not merely a tool but a systemic agent of change\u2014affecting everything from healthcare diagnostics to border control and school assessments. However, with rising deployment comes rising complexity and risk. According to PwC\u2019s Global AI Study (2024), 72% of reported AI-related failures stem not from flawed algorithms, but from organizational governance gaps\u2014such as unclear roles, absent risk protocols, and non-existent stakeholder redress mechanisms. Meanwhile, regulatory frameworks like the EU&nbsp;<span>AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), ISO/IEC 42001:2023, and the EU Data Act (Regulation 2023/2854) are raising the bar for legal compliance, transparency, and accountability.&nbsp;</span>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Against this backdrop, this whitepaper introduces AIGN OS\u2014the world\u2019s first certifiable AI Governance Operating System. AIGN OS is a governance infrastructure engineered to be auditable, modular, and globally applicable. Its seven-layer architecture operationalizes governance logic across the AI lifecycle: from principle to protocol, from compliance to certification.

Analyzing data up to the pre-pandemic (COVID-19) period, e.g. from 1980-2019 and using the ARDL bounds test approach, we found that long-run gross domestic saving rate and gross fixed investment in Indonesia are explained by real GDP and lagged real GDP, respectively; long-run economic growth is largely explained (positively) by physical capital, labor force, and net capital inflows. It is evident from our study that the financial and capital account openness indicators, real interest rate and net capital inflows respectively, do not impact saving and investment in long-run. At the same time, the financial openness indicator does not seem to have any influence on long-run economic growth.

Contrary to early promises of digital disintermediation and democratized organizations, we show how algorithmic management collapses traditional managerial layers while replacing visible authority with opaque, centralized control exercised by platform owners and algorithm designers-modern \"digital lords.\" Through a critical synthesis of organization theory, platform capitalism, and debates on techno-feudalism, the paper examines how data abundance and algorithmic rule abolish the roles of human mediators, assign workers to a new status of \"algorithmic vassalage,\" and subvert classic mechanisms of autonomy, accountability, and collective action. Case vignettes from gig platforms, corporate HR, and social media detail the concrete mechanisms through which algorithmic governance erodes voice, manufactures consent, and encloses opportunities within proprietary infrastructures. We further analyze the resulting \"democratic time lag\"-the growing gap between fast-moving algorithmic institutions and slower, human-centered democratic or regulatory systems. By tracing how digital platforms entrench dependency and inequality at machine speed, we argue that the collapse of hierarchy is not a story of worker emancipation, but of renewed subjugation in new, less visible forms. The article concludes by surveying emerging strategies for organizational governance, digital democracy, and resistance-emphasizing the urgent role for organizational studies in exposing hidden power, theorizing alternatives, and supporting institutional adaptation as the social contract is rewritten in the age of AI."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u6570\u5b57\u5c01\u5efa\u5236\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86AI\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u5c42\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5de5\u4eba\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\"\u7b97\u6cd5\u9644\u5c5e\"\uff0c\u640d\u5bb3\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u8d23\u4efb\u5236\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c11\u4e3b\u5236\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u62b5\u6297\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u6784\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u6743\u529b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u65b0\u5784\u5f0f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6743\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u65e9\u671f\u5173\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u53bb\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5316\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u5728\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8d28\u4e0a\u5982\u4f55\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u4e3a\u96f7\u540c\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u4e2d\u592e\u63a7\u5236\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u5de5\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u8d23\u4efb\u5236\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u6d88\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5e73\u53f0\u8d44\u672c\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u6280\u672f\u5c01\u5efa\u5236\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5e73\u53f0\u8d44\u672c\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5c01\u5efa\u5236\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u4f01\u4e1aHR\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4f8b\u8bc1\u6765\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u5177\u4f53\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u5c42\uff0c\u4f46\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4ecb\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff1b\u5de5\u4eba\u88ab\u8d4b\u4e88\"\u7b97\u6cd5\u9644\u5c5e\"\u65b0\u8eab\u4efd\uff1b\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u8d23\u4efb\u5236\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u88ab\u7a81\u7834\uff1b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\"\u6c11\u4e3b\u5236\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\"\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u6570\u5b57\u5c01\u5efa\u5236\"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3AI\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6743\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff1b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u6743\u529b\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u5c01\u5efa\u5236\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u5de5\u4eba\u6743\u5229\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff1b\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u6c11\u4e3b\u548c\u62b5\u6297\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u66b4\u9732\u9690\u85cf\u6743\u529b\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5236\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Consistent with the market timing theory, idiosyncratic skewness is significantly positively related to equity issues, while the impact on debt issues is negative and of less importance. Moreover, we find equity issues to be accompanied by debt retirement programs. Contrasting the market timing theory, these effects are not persistent and vanish after about three years. Both the short-term and long-term results are robust to a wide range of robustness checks. Our results are therefore consistent with a long-term validity of the trade-off theory, including market timing as a short-term factor."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f02\u504f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u65f6\u673a\u5bf9\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5e02\u573a\u65f6\u673a\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u77ed\u671f\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u3002", "research_question": "\u5e02\u573a\u65f6\u673a\u5bf9\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u7279\u5f02\u504f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u504f\u5dee\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e02\u573a\u65f6\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528", "theoretical_framework": "\u5e02\u573a\u65f6\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u7279\u5f02\u504f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u53d8\u91cf", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f02\u504f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c", "findings": "\u7279\u5f02\u504f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80a1\u6743\u53d1\u884c\u5448\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0e\u503a\u52a1\u53d1\u884c\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u57283\u5e74\u540e\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u80a1\u6743\u53d1\u884c\u901a\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u503a\u52a1\u51cf\u5c11", "theory_contributions": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u65f6\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89d2", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u5e02\u573a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u878d\u8d44\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u56e0\u7d20"}}

In the Netherlands, where renewable sources accounted for over 50% of electricity production in 2024, imbalance prices have become especially erratic due to a unique dual pricing mechanism and growing grid congestion. Despite this, the Dutch balancing market remains underexplored in academic research. This paper addresses that gap by developing and evaluating short-term probabilistic forecasting models specifically designed for the Dutch context. Using historical imbalance and intraday prices, we compare three approaches: a naive benchmark, a LASSO-estimated autoregressive model (LEAR), and an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model trained for quantile-based forecasting. Rather than focusing solely on forecast accuracy, we embed the predictions into a stylized trading framework that allocates volumes between the intraday and balancing markets. This framework also incorporates curtailment, a critical operational measure now prevalent across the Dutch grid. Our findings show that while XGBoost delivers better probabilistic calibration, the LEAR model more effectively identifies price spikes, resulting in superior performance in certain trading strategies. Forecast-informed trading yields up to 13% higher revenues, and the inclusion of curtailment enhances profitability by removing downside risk. The results highlight that imbalance prices can be forecasted effectively, and incorporating these forecasts into trading strategies can yield significant financial benefits. However, high statistical forecast accuracy does not always translate into superior financial outcomes."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8377\u5170\u5e73\u8861\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u4ea4\u6613\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u53ef\u5e26\u676513%\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u8377\u5170\u5e73\u8861\u5e02\u573a\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8d22\u52a1\u6536\u76ca\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8377\u5170\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u5360\u6bd4\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u4ef7\u683c\u5f02\u5e38\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6b64\u5e02\u573a\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8377\u5170\u53cc\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u62e5\u5835\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\uff08\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08XGBoost\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4ea4\u6613\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u65e5\u5185\u4ef7\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6734\u7d20\u57fa\u51c6\u3001LASSO\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08LEAR\uff09\u548c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u7684XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u5305\u542b\u9650\u7535\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "XGBoost\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46LEAR\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4ef7\u683c\u5c16\u5cf0\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u53ef\u5e26\u676513%\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9650\u7535\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8377\u5170\u5e73\u8861\u5e02\u573a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u62e5\u5835\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u5e02\u573a\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u9650\u7535\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0b\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, the use of ICT has raised environmental concerns, due to the increased consumption of ICT. This study examined the effect of ICT on carbon emissions in selected BRICS economies between 2009 and 2022. To adopt the appropriate estimation techniques, panel unit tests (LLC and IPS) were conducted. The tests revealed a mixed sequence of integrations between the variables, i.e. I (0) and I (1). This necessitates the use of panel ARDL estimation techniques. Using the PMG (pooled mean group) estimator, the panel ARDL was selected as the appropriate model for this study. The FMOLS (fully modified ordinary least squares) and FE (Fixed effects) methods were also utilized in this study as part of the robustness assessment. The findings from the panel long-run ARDL reveal that ICT, national output, and financial development increase emissions, while innovation reduces them. Furthermore, the findings from FMOLS and FE confirm the results obtained from ARDL. Therefore, this study recommends using green technology to achieve net-zero emissions, reducing our digital carbon footprint on an individual and societal level, and scaling adaptation while reducing global emissions as a means of improving environmental sustainability within BRICS nations."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86ICT\u5bf9BRICS\u56fd\u5bb6\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ICT\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u4ea7\u51fa\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u53d1\u5c55\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u800c\u521b\u65b0\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u653e\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u7eff\u8272\u6280\u672f\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u5b57\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c0\u96f6\u6392\u653e\u3002", "research_question": "ICT\u5bf9BRICS\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "ICT\u572821\u4e16\u7eaa\u6210\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u95ee\u9898", "theoretical_framework": "\u73af\u5883\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001ICT\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff082009-2022\u5e74BRICS\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9762\u677f\u5355\u4f4d\u6839\u68c0\u9a8c\uff08LLC\u548cIPS\uff09\u3001\u9762\u677fARDL\u6a21\u578b\u3001PMG\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caFMOLS\u548cFE\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c", "findings": "ICT\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u4ea7\u51fa\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u53d1\u5c55\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u800c\u521b\u65b0\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u3002FMOLS\u548cFE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eARDL\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86ICT\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3aBRICS\u56fd\u5bb6\u5236\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u7eff\u8272\u6280\u672f\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u5b57\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c0\u96f6\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u63aa\u65bd"}}

Treated as perpetual outsiders, the few Chinese people who were permitted to migrate to the U.S. were categorically photographed, measured, interrogated, and required to prove their right to exist in the United States through extensive documentation and external validation by white witnesses. Many Chinese Americans suffered constant invasions of their privacy that generated perpetual fears and significant harms over the course of entire lifetimes.
