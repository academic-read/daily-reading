To this end, this paper presents amultiform optimization algorithm with coupled subspace alignment and two-stage adaptive differential evolution (MFO-CSA-TADE), enabling efficient solution of complex scheduling problems through constructing a novel multiform optimization framework and knowledge transfer mechanism. First, the strong coupling relationshipsof energy system is decoupled to decompose the original problem into two weakly constrained surrogate tasks: an interval-valued electro-thermal uncertainty task and a deterministic electro-cooling task, forming the proposed multiform optimization framework. Second, a knowledge transfer strategy based on coupled subspace alignmentis developed. Through alignment mapping and cooperative evolution of cross-task coupled electrical variables, efficient knowledge transfer between surrogate tasks is achieved, overcoming the information interaction barriers in traditional multiform optimization. The two-stage adaptive differential evolution strategy (TADE) employs aneighborhood dual mutation mechanism to achieve the task optimization. The first stage uses a diversity-driven TADE to concurrently evolve two surrogate tasks, maximizing the exploration of feasible region intersections to enhance solution diversity and robustness. The second stage utilizes a convergence-driven TADE to focus onthe original task\u2019s feasible space, generating high-quality Pareto sets. Case studies in a Shanxi mine demonstrate that compared with six benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm maintains superior Pareto front quality and uncertainty handling while reducing computation time to 1/6-1/3, significantly improving solution efficiency in complex scheduling scenarios."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08MFO-CSA-TADE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7164\u77ff\u7efc\u5408\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6e90\u8377\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7164\u77ff\u7efc\u5408\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6e90\u8377\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5168\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u8026\u5408\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u3001\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08TADE\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f31\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u52301/6-1/3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\u969c\u788d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8c03\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7164\u77ff\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper examines how Talmudic sages developed sophisticated rhetorical mechanisms to bridge the gap between rule-following and moral excellence, offering valuable insights for modern organizational ethics. The study focuses on a Talmudic devices: the \"ke-ilu\" (it is as if) formulation and similar terms, which establish powerful analogies between ordinary actions and deep spiritual truths; equivalence statements, which link individual precepts to a multitude of commandments; and hyperbolic comparisons, which serve to underscore moral gravity. These techniques transformed ordinary behavior into acts of cosmic significance, making ethical achievement accessible while eliminating morally neutral actions. The paper argues that modern leaders can apply these ancient insights by using compelling analogies, emotional resonance, and values-driven storytelling to inspire ethical excellence rather than merely enforcing minimum standards.

Our experiments reveal that social support moderates the effect of stress on indulgent food choices, with individuals with lower support more likely to indulge under stress. We argue that this occurs because social support provides psychological resources that help individuals regulate their behavior under stress. Using a process-by-moderation approach, we demonstrate that providing contextual support, enhancing perceived control, and promoting deliberative thinking attenuate the effect of low social support on indulgent behavior under stress. At a broader level, we test these predictions by analyzing the impact of Hurricane Sandy, an exogenous stressor, on indulgent food purchases. A Difference-in-Difference (DiD) analysis in a natural experiment reveals that while Sandy-affected areas experienced a significant rise in indulgent food sales, this increase was attenuated in communities with higher social support, suggesting that the availability of social resources plays a critical role in moderating stress-driven consumption.</span><span>&nbsp;Together, our research highlights how social support shapes stress-induced consumption patterns and identifies novel factors that affect indulgent food choices on a real-world and large-scale basis.</span><span></span>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6025\u6027\u538b\u529b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u653e\u7eb5\u98df\u54c1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u653e\u7eb5\u98df\u54c1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f4e\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u653e\u7eb5\u3002", "research_question": "\u6025\u6027\u538b\u529b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u653e\u7eb5\u98df\u54c1\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u538b\u529b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u653e\u7eb5\u98df\u54c1\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u5e2e\u52a9\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\uff1b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u98d3\u98ce\u6851\u8fea\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u4f4e\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u66f4\u6613\u653e\u7eb5\uff1b\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u8d44\u6e90\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u538b\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u5728\u538b\u529b\u4e0e\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u589e\u5f3a\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\uff09\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u538b\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u653e\u7eb5\u6d88\u8d39\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Their efficient operation and resilience against disruptions rely on advanced computational methods capable of capturing inherent dependencies and real-time interactions, challenges that traditional modeling approaches struggle to address. GNNs, by representing these systems as graph-structured data, offer a powerful framework for learning spatial, temporal, and relational dependencies, enabling predictive insights, adaptive decision-making, and optimization at scale. This review systematically examines the role of GNNs in improving situational awareness, predictive analysis, and infrastructure operations, highlighting advancements in architectures, methodological innovations, and real-world applications. We further assess key challenges, including model interpretability, real-time adaptability, and cross-domain data integration, and identify research directions necessary for bridging theoretical developments with practical implementation.

However, achieving reliable forecasting remains challenging due to complex and dynamically evolving spatiotemporal patterns. Existing forecasting methods often fail to adapt effectively to these dynamic traffic conditions and typically incur high computational costs, significantly limiting their deployment in real-time traffic management scenarios. To address these engineering challenges, this study proposes a novel Attention-based Spatial-Temporal Network (ASTNet), explicitly designed for adaptive and efficient real-time traffic forecasting. ASTNet introduces two innovative AI-driven modules: an Adaptive Spatial Graph Encoder (ASGE), which dynamically models evolving spatial dependencies from real-time traffic data, thus overcoming the limitations of static graph structures; and a Temporal Attention-Gated Unit (TAGU), which efficiently captures critical temporal dependencies through the integration of recurrent gating mechanisms and self-attention techniques. Extensive evaluations conducted on widely-used traffic benchmark datasets (PEMS04, METR-LA, etc.) confirm that ASTNet achieves superior predictive accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing inference latency.

From DSO\u2019s perspective, state-of-the-art DNEP-related models opt for systemfriendly DER investments, that satisfy the required technical standards regarding reliability and security of supply, but do not guarantee the financial sustainability of profit-based DER investments made by private companies called Energy Service Providers (ESPs). On the other hand, ESPs opt for profit-maximizing DER planning decisions, which may lead to unnecessarily higher DNEP-related costs for the DSO or may also lead to unpredictably higher RES spillage in the long term. In this paper, we propose a novel ESP-DSO coordination scheme, which strikes an optimal balance between regulated DNEP-related investments (made by the DSO) and profit-based DER investments (made by the ESP). Performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing business-as-usual solutions achieving a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution for both stakeholders. We also introduce two novel metrics, namely \u201cnew distribution network Lines to DER/Total investment Ratio LtDR/LtTR\u201d, which can be used by the regulator or policy makers towards validating or promoting sophisticated Flexible Connection Agreements (FCAs) respectively. Finally, our sensitivity analysis results facilitate easily configurable FCAs(according to several ESP\u2019s conditional value at risk parameters and various mixes of DER investment portfolios), which in turn are expected to unlock the economic potential of long-term public-private partnership investment funds towards achieving the goals of the clean energy transition."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684ESP-DSO\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861DSO\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6295\u8d44\u4e0eESP\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u6027DER\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u8d62\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807LtDR/LtTR\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\uff08DER\uff09\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u534f\u8c03DSO\u548cESP\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6280\u672f\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740DER\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cDSO\u548cESP\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff1aDSO\u5173\u6ce8\u6280\u672f\u6807\u51c6\uff0cESP\u8ffd\u6c42\u76c8\u5229\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\uff08DER\uff09\u548c\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u7edc\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5212\uff08DNEP\uff09\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684ESP-DSO\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u8d62\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807LtDR/LtTR\u3002\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u534f\u8bae\uff08FCAs\uff09\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u534f\u8c03DSO\u548cESP\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982FCAs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u516c\u79c1\u5408\u4f5c\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While Vehicle Digital Twins (VDTs) have proven valuable for predictive maintenance and performance optimization, the development of Driver Digital Twins (DrDTs) remains fragmented and lacks standardization. Integrating VDTs, DrDTs, and Road Digital Twins (RDTs) offers new opportunities for adaptive control, personalized assistance, and traffic management, but also poses challenges in interoperability, data synchronization, and privacy. This survey systematically reviews over ninety key studies from 2008 to 2025, focusing on the impact of VDTs in real-time operations, the conceptualization and current limitations of DrDTs, and the emerging architectures that support their integration. Our analysis highlights critical research gaps\u2014including the absence of unified frameworks and standardized DrDT definitions\u2014and suggests future directions for developing robust, interoperable, and human-centric digital twin platforms for next-generation mobility."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08DT\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08VDT\uff09\u3001\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08DrDT\uff09\u548c\u9053\u8def\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08RDT\uff09\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ca\u5176\u6311\u6218\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210VDT\u3001DrDT\u548cRDT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8f85\u52a9\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1VDT\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46DrDT\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u548c\u9053\u8def\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e862008\u81f32025\u5e74\u95f490\u591a\u9879\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790VDT\u3001DrDT\u548cRDT\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0DrDT\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0cVDT\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9762\u4e34\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u672c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, traditional manual inspection methods are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but are also prone to human errors, leading to fluctuations in inspection quality and efficiency. To address this issue, this article proposes an automated inspection method for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based on a Hierarchical Training Fusion Reinforcement Learning Network (HTFN), which combines Hierarchical Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms for autonomous route planning and navigation. This approach provides precise support for task path planning in complex geographical environments, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in such scenarios. Additionally, the system utilizes a multimodal large language model for automatic fault detection and alarm, enhancing real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated decision-making. The integration of these technologies results in a highly intelligent and automated UAV operation and control inspection system, minimizing human intervention while improving inspection accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system effectively identifies defects in railway infrastructure, significantly improves inspection efficiency, reduces operational costs, and enhances operational control efficiency, ensuring the smooth completion of tasks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u878d\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HTFN\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u52a8\u5de1\u68c0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DQN\uff09\u548c\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u62a5\u8b66\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u94c1\u8def\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5de1\u68c0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u94c1\u8def\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5de1\u68c0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u5de1\u68c0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u5730\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5de1\u68c0\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5206\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u878d\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HTFN\uff09\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DQN\uff09\u3001\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eHTFN\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u52a8\u5de1\u68c0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DQN\u548cPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u62a5\u8b66\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u94c1\u8def\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de1\u68c0\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5de1\u68c0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de1\u68c0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5de1\u68c0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u94c1\u8def\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The ANN achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9876 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3421. Optimization reduced radioactive concentration by 15% compared to a baseline scenario, maintained personnel exposure within IAEA safety thresholds (20 mSv), and completed decision cycles in under 3 seconds. This framework demonstrates the feasibility of AI-driven real-time nuclear emergency management, offering improved decision-making over traditional methods."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u6838\u4e8b\u6545\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6d53\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u6838\u4e8b\u6545\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6838\u4e8b\u6545\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u66f4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANN\uff09\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08fmincon\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316PSO\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MATLAB\u751f\u62103600\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8f90\u5c04\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ANN\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "findings": "ANN\u7684R2\u4e3a0.9876\uff0cRMSE\u4e3a0.3421\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6d53\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e15%\uff0c\u4eba\u5458\u66b4\u9732\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\u5185\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u5468\u671f\u5c0f\u4e8e3\u79d2\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AI\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6838\u5e94\u6025\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6838\u4e8b\u6545\u5e94\u6025\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, some of the images with privacy leakage can only be obtained by analyzing multiple content-related images, and are hardly detected in a one-image scenario. Although global semantic features like context and topic may contain information to reveal these images, it is difficult to obtain this information by relying only on the features of image modality. To solve this problem, an image privacy detection method combining multi-image correlation and multimodal features is proposed in this paper. This method leverages a set of semantically related images along with their corresponding text summary to establish semantic correlations, and utilizes the advantages of additive and dot product attention mechanisms to construct effective multimodal fusion between the text summary and each individual image feature. This enables each image to perform privacy-leakage detection not only based on its own features, but also the contextual information from semantically related images. At the same time, in order to further strengthen the correlation between modality and privacy leakage, this paper also incorporates the saliency feature of both modalities into the privacy-leaking image prediction process, providing analysis concerns from different perspectives. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively capture inter-image semantic correlations through multi-image text summarization, which is helpful in improving the overall performance of privacy-leaking image detection."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5173\u8054\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u79c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5173\u8054\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5355\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u67d0\u4e9b\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08\u52a0\u6027\u548c\u70b9\u79ef\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5173\u8054\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u9690\u79c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Transit is a right\u2014not a privilege\u2014that tempers territorial sovereignty. Though largely forgotten today, it springs from the responsibility States bear to the international community when their territory hosts infrastructure of global utility.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yet the Internet stands as a striking exception to this tradition. Despite its importance, no doctrine of transit constrains States\u2019 power to block or disrupt Internet traffic that merely passes through their territory. This is no theoretical concern: States are growing bolder in tampering with digital infrastructure, and the Internet\u2019s survival as a global network is at risk.</span></p>\n<p><span>This Article makes the case for extending transit law protections to the Internet. Drawing on the first comprehensive survey of this body of law in decades, it distills six core principles that reveal the field\u2019s logic and coherence across four centuries.

Using panel data from 2001 to 2021, we find that increased exposure to renewable energy is associated with lower productivity and profitability, but higher volatility in financial performance. Such impacts are particularly pronounced for firms in sectors with high energy demands, where the cost and consistency of energy supply are crucial for maintaining competitive advantages.

The improved grasshopper optimization algorithm (IGOA) is developed to avoid this characteristic for obtaining the optimal and better global solution of the reactive power flow optimization problem (ORPD). Therefore, the ORPD problem is represented by the total active power loss. The grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) basically mimics the real grasshoppers in terms of local movement to obtain food and wide movement for migration. The grasshopper movement relationship was given by an easy mathematical equation influenced by surrounding forces and social interaction represented by \u00a0the distance between the different grasshoppers in the swarm. However, a linear control parameter was added in the previous grasshopper movement equation that gradually decreases in order to converge to the optimal solution. In order to improve this method, a random parameter was integrated into the previous control parameter, similar to what is found in the particle swarm method, to disperse the search in the feasible space for getting a better solution and also speed up the convergence. This method and the improved method were implemented on model electric networks IEEE 30-bus and \u00a0IEEE 118-bus \u00a0in order to reduce losses, with various objectives.

It is called the Soil Pore Space Structural Classification System (SPSCS) and has a design partially similar to the Textural Classification System. The SPSCS has two categorical levels: Order (9) and Sub-Order (4). Therefore, 36 possible structural classes are foreseen, called Families, which group soils according to air availability curves Aa(suction s) close, where Aa(s) is the complement of the water retention curve (WRC) to the saturation water content. To specify the Order, the percentages of macro, meso, and microspaces are plotted on a ternary classification diagram, called structural triangle, in which its specific subareas will define the Orders. The Sub-Orders are defined from four variation ranges of the effective porosity values. In these procedures, the van Genuchten WRC equation and an optimization protocol of its parameters are required. Within each Family, its theoretical reference soils, called type-soils, are conceived. The distributions of the Aa(s) type-curves of the 36 Families thus allow a global assessment of the porous volumetric structure of the soils, which makes SPSCS a new tool for pedological investigation. SPSCS also allows an estimate of the air and water capacities and the saturated hydraulic conductivity. The application potential of SPSCS will be enhanced if other pedological tools are used, such as mineralogical, textural, pedogenetic studies, etc. In a future paper, the SPSCS will be applied to a wide database to validate its procedures and demonstrate its application potential."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b54\u9699\u5927\u5c0f\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u5b54\u9699\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SPSCS\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b9\u4e2a\u4e3b\u7c7b\u548c4\u4e2a\u4e9a\u7c7b\uff0c\u517136\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5b54\u9699\u5206\u5e03\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5b54\u9699\u503c\u8303\u56f4\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528van Genuchten\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u3002SPSCS\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u571f\u58e4\u5b54\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4f30\u7b97\u7a7a\u6c14\u548c\u6c34\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ca\u9971\u548c\u5bfc\u6c34\u7387\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b54\u9699\u5927\u5c0f\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u571f\u58e4\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5173\u6ce8\u5b54\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b54\u9699\u5206\u5e03\u66f2\u7ebf\uff08Aa(s)\uff09\u548cvan Genuchten\u6c34\u5206\u4fdd\u6301\u66f2\u7ebf\uff08WRC\uff09\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u56fe\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5b54\u9699\u503c\u8303\u56f4\u5b9a\u4e4936\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316van Genuchten\u65b9\u7a0b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "findings": "SPSCS\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30\u571f\u58e4\u5b54\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u4f30\u7b97\u7a7a\u6c14\u548c\u6c34\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ca\u9971\u548c\u5bfc\u6c34\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u5b54\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u7c7b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u571f\u58e4\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Specifically, this type of disclosure is more common for firms that are cash-poorer, more indebted, riskier, are seen as more exposed to biodiversity issues, firms that have a higher score in environmental innovation, and that are already engaged in some reduction of their biodiversity impact.

Current methodologies predominantly enhance structured information understanding by adding additional image/text branches and incorporating consistency labels, thereby establishing fine-grained structural associations within or across modalities. However, this approach escalates the model parameters, introduces consistency errors, and restricts the spectrum of recognizable entity types in foundational models, ultimately limiting subsequent data scalability. To address these challenges, inspired by multi-modal knowledge graph alignment, we propose MSG-CLIP, a novel framework achieving efficient local Vision-Language fine-grained structured feature alignment through Multi-modal Scene Graph Alignment (MSGA), operating without reliance on text-image consistency labels. Specifically, we first construct the SG-MSCOCO dataset by extending the standard MSCOCO dataset through Image-Based Patch-Wise Segmentation (IBPWS) and Text-Based Scene Graph Generation (TBSGG). Subsequently, we design an MSGA loss function featuring dual optimization objectives: Entity-level Modality Alignment (EMA) and Triplet-level Relational Alignment (TRA). Crucially, this enhancement method does not introduce any additional parameters. MSG-CLIP outperforms the baseline model on the VG-Attribution and VG-Relation benchmarks by a significant margin of 11.2\\% and 2.5\\%, respectively. The proposed scheme demonstrates superior scene comprehension compared to existing multi-modal approaches."}, "AI": {"tldr": "MSG-CLIP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08MSGA\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u907f\u514d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5206\u652f\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08EMA\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u91cd\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08TRA\uff09\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaSG-MSCOCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eIBPWS\u548cTBSGG\uff09\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1MSGA\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u542bEMA\u548cTRA\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u3002", "findings": "MSG-CLIP\u5728VG-Attribution\u548cVG-Relation\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b11.2%\u548c2.5%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "MSG-CLIP\u5728\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Using a panel dataset from 2009 to 2022, we find that firms using captive insurance benefit from decreased borrowing costs and marginal tax rates, as well as from its association with increased dividend payments and greater levels of investment in intangible asset development. Our results hold when considering the ex-post and ex-ante situations of firms adopting captive insurance structures. Firms with higher levels of holdings by insiders and institutional blockholders are more likely to use captive insurance, as are firms with higher levels of total executive compensation and higher proportions of stock-based compensation. However, firms with higher proportions of options-based compensation are less likely to use captive insurance. Comparisons across financial and governance models indicate that the relationship between captive insurance usage and governance variables is stronger than the relationship between captive insurance usage and financial variables."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u501f\u6b3e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u7a0e\u7387\u3001\u80a1\u606f\u652f\u4ed8\u548c\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u4ea7\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d7\u76ca\u3002", "research_question": "\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u501f\u6b3e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u7a0e\u7387\u3001\u80a1\u606f\u652f\u4ed8\u548c\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u4ea7\u6295\u8d44\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282009\u5e74\u81f32022\u5e74\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u501f\u6b3e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8fb9\u9645\u7a0e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u80a1\u606f\u652f\u4ed8\u548c\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u4ea7\u6295\u8d44\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u4eba\u548c\u673a\u6784\u5927\u80a1\u4e1c\u6301\u80a1\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9ad8\u3001\u9ad8\u7ba1\u85aa\u916c\u9ad8\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d22\u52a1\u53ca\u6cbb\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u4fdd\u4fdd\u9669\u6f5c\u5728\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative L2-errors below 10\u22122. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher\u2013subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals.

Method: Using a qualitative action research design, the study combined co-design workshops, focus groups, and ethnographic observation with general practitioners (GPs) and patients in a primary care context, supported by BioGipuzkoa. Results: Findings identified five interdependent factors shaping trustworthy GenAI adoption: epistemic uncertainty and clinical judgment, trust and explainability, accountability and error, data ownership and consent, and digital divides and access.

However, NBS-related policies can also increase vulnerabilities and exacerbate inequalities. This paper aims to improve knowledge of how NBS-related policies affect social justice and vulnerable groups in particular. Based on a detailed study of current NBS developments in the City of Vienna, a participatory research design involving vulnerable groups, and a mixed methods approach conducting the empirical analysis, the paper focuses on social (in)equality in relation to NBS and urban heat. It uses Nancy Fraser&apos;s justice approach to examine the spatial distribution of NBS, the recognition of the needs and preferences of heat affected individuals in relation to NBS, and the representation of vulnerable groups and their interests in NBS planning processes. The study highlights inequalities in access to NBS, as well as a lack of recognition and representation in decision-making processes. The findings emphasise the demand for inclusive planning processes that directly involve vulnerable groups, ensuring that their needs and perspectives are adequately recognized and represented. Ultimately, the paper argues that integrating justice into NBS planning can help mitigate social inequalities and foster more equitable adaptation to urban heat."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff08NBS\uff09\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u6b63\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u4e5f\u7eb3\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86NBS\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "research_question": "NBS\u76f8\u5173\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u6b63\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\uff08\u5982\u57ce\u5e02\u70ed\u6d6a\uff09\u51f8\u663e\u4e86NBS\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u91c7\u7528Nancy Fraser\u7684\u6b63\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790NBS\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ef4\u4e5f\u7eb3\u7684NBS\u53d1\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0NBS\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u6b63\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eNBS\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u6b63\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbNBS\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u57ce\u5e02\u70ed\u6d6a\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

This leads to potentially negative impacts on several resource related issues. The UNEP/SETAC life cycle initiative task force mineral resources has recommended six methods to assess different impact pathways in a resource contex. The aim of the paper is to analyze these approaches when assessing abiotic resource use for four different energy transition paths for Germany. The associated material use shows that until 2045 sand and gravel , iron, and crude oil are needed. The results show that the methods indicate similar hotspots although each method covers a different perspective on resource assessment.

Mobile measurements were conducted to collect UHII data across different time periods in both winter and summer. A selection of representative urban morphological parameters\u2014classified into two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characteristics\u2014was analyzed using a combination of Kriging spatial interpolation, Spearman correlation analysis, and the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. The results indicate significant spatial and temporal differences in UHII between the old and new districts, with the old districts generally exhibiting more pronounced heat island effects. The influence of different morphological factors on UHII displays marked seasonal variation: during the daytime, 3D morphological parameters show stronger correlations with UHII in winter, while in summer, 2D parameters become more influential. At night, the impact of urban morphological characteristics is comparatively weaker. The RF model further quantifies the relative importance of each parameter, revealing that building density (BD)and road density (RD) are the most significant among the 2D parameters (with maximum importance values of 0.274 and 0.600), while mean building height(MBH) and street height-to-width ratio (H/W) are the dominant factors among the 3D parameters (with maximum importance values of 0.233 and 0.210). In the old districts, BD, RD, and vegetation coverage ratio(VCR) are the primary morphological drivers of local UHII, whereas in the new districts, street orientation(SO), BD, and MBH are the main influencing factors. The study recommends that urban planning should aim to optimize spatial building layouts and holistically integrate both 2D distributions and 3D structural features of urban morphology to mitigate UHI effects and promote livable and sustainable urban development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u897f\u5b89\u65b0\u65e7\u57ce\u533a\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u57ce\u5e02\u70ed\u5c9b\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08UHII\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u51ac\u590f\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6bb5\u7684UHII\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u514b\u91cc\u91d1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u3001Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u65e7\u57ce\u533aUHII\u65f6\u7a7a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u65e7\u57ce\u533a\u70ed\u5c9b\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002\u5f62\u6001\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9UHII\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c3D\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u51ac\u5b63\u767d\u5929\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c2D\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u590f\u5b63\u767d\u5929\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5404\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5c40\u90e8\u57ce\u5e02\u70ed\u5c9b\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08UHII\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u70ed\u5c9b\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57ce\u5e02\u70ed\u5c9b\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u79fb\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cfUHII\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u514b\u91cc\u91d1\u63d2\u503c\u3001Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "\u65b0\u65e7\u57ce\u533aUHII\u65f6\u7a7a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c2D\u548c3D\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9UHII\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u70ed\u5c9b\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7b51\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u70ed\u5c9b\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

Decreased rental vacancies are correlated with higher price-to-rent ratios, increased sales, more housing vacancies, and shorter selling times. To examine these market interactions, I develop a search and matching model of the housing market that incorporates a rental market with search frictions, heterogeneous buyers, and free entry of sellers and landlords. I simulate the model using perfectly correlated demand and supply-side shocks to match the stylized facts. It illustrates that fluctuations in rental vacancies influence agents\u2019 decisions to enter the housing market, consequently altering market tightness in both markets.

However, collecting topographic beach data is possible for only a few days per month. By reducing the seaward extent of the survey, the incurred costs and risks to the survey schedule could be greatly reduced. However, this would result in information loss at the lowest extremes of the subaerial beach. This study assesses the feasibility of predicting this part of the beach using neural networks based on partial beach profile data. A range of network architectures were tested alongside linear extrapolation, which was used as a baseline model. Each model was tested on three beaches with varying morphology, ranging from steep (reflective) to mildly sloping (dissipative). The presence of morphological features was found to play a dominant role in the accuracy of the predicted profiles; profiles with more pronounced cross-shore morphological features, such as sandbars, produced the highest error. While local connectivity of each network architecture was found to be the key factor in producing realistic profiles, the 1D Convolutional Neural Network was found to be the most effective with an average RMSE of between 0.026-0.119m. This RMSE is not substantially larger than the vertical accuracy of current survey techniques (0.03 m), and the study found that errors of this magnitude have negligible effects when the survey data is used to calculate beach volumes and conduct numerical wave runup analysis to assess coastal flood risk."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u6d77\u6ee9\u5256\u9762\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4e\u6f6e\u7ebf\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6d77\u6ee9\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b01D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6d77\u6ee9\u4f53\u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6d77\u5cb8\u6d2a\u6c34\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u6d77\u6ee9\u5256\u9762\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4e\u6f6e\u7ebf\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u6d77\u6ee9\u5f62\u6001\uff1f", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u6d77\u5cb8\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u59821D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u6d77\u6ee9\uff08\u9661\u5ced\u81f3\u5e73\u7f13\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff1b1D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747RMSE\u4e3a0.026-0.119m\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6d77\u6ee9\u5f62\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f1D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u6d77\u5cb8\u76d1\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002"}}

However, existing methods suffer from several drawbacks, primarily manifested in long training times, with two main reasons: Firstly, there are numerous empty regions between the camera and the object surface, where the in-formation contribution to the final reconstruction quality is low. Secondly, each ray sample requires querying large multilayer perceptrons, leading to heavy computational burdens during training, affecting efficiency. Additionally, the lack of geometric constraints during 3D reconstruction results in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce a method called PM-NeuS. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) a progressive sampling strategy based on multi-resolution hash coding is designed to reasonably sample coordinate points in the space and reduce training time, and (2) the use of monocular prior knowledge to constrain surface geometry, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality.

It develops an agent-based model (ABM) with a structurally determined set of parameters to distinguish between stylized superpower and middle-power firms. They initially differ in network connectivity and intangible endowments. The model dynamics involve endogenous innovation decisions and network building consistent with a preferential-attachment mechanism. Simulating the system\u2019s evolution reveals that initial asymmetries are amplified over time, resulting in persistent but bounded gaps in performance and network position between firm types. AI-driven intangible assets especially exacerbate these gaps. There are also heterogeneous responses to dynamic events, such as network-wide shocks (e.g., technological and geopolitical shocks) or policy interventions (e.g., AI grants, diversification support), highlighting that the returns to firm capabilities are contingent on the firm\u2019s capability states and the dynamic environments induced by such external events.

Herder cooperatives have emerged as a promising institutional innovation to address these sustainability challenges.OBJECTIVE\uff1aThis study aims to assess whether herder cooperatives achieve higher multidimensional efficiency (integrating ecological, economic, and social performance) than large-scale and small-scale independent herders in Inner Mongolia. The analysis is conceptually grounded in the Resource-Based View (RBV), Institutional Theory, and Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) to explain cooperative advantages.METHODS\uff1aIn 2022, we surveyed 223 herder households across four counties in Inner Mongolia. We developed an efficiency index with 18 indicators spanning ecological (pasture condition, stocking rate), economic (household income, livestock productivity), and social (social capital, livelihood stability) dimensions. Composite efficiency scores were calculated using an entropy-weighted method. We then employed Tobit regression to identify drivers of efficiency, particularly the effects of cooperative membership and resource endowments (e.g., grassland quality, labor, education, assets).RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\uff1aCooperative households significantly outperformed both large-scale and small-scale independent households in ecological and economic efficiency, while performing similarly in social efficiency. For example, cooperatives attained higher ecological efficiency (0.1134) than large-scale and small-scale households (0.1040 and 0.1037, respectively), and higher economic efficiency (0.0387 vs. 0.0355 and 0.0340). Social efficiency was comparable (~0.077 in all groups). Consequently, the composite efficiency of cooperative households (0.2288) exceeded those of large-scale (0.2169) and small-scale (0.2100) households. Tobit regression indicates that cooperative membership and favorable resource endowments significantly increase overall efficiency, whereas financial constraints and non-livestock training had limited or negative effects. These findings demonstrate a clear cooperative efficiency advantage. They are consistent with RBV, Institutional Theory, and SLF: cooperatives bundle resources, align member incentives for collective sustainability, and enhance multiple livelihood capitals to improve resilience.SIGNIFICANCE\uff1aHerder cooperatives are a valuable institutional innovation for sustainable pastoralism. Policy support for cooperative models and collective grazing management can improve grassland sustainability and foster rural development in pastoral regions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u7267\u6c11\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u6548\u7387\uff08\u751f\u6001\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\uff09\u4e0a\u662f\u5426\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u7267\u6c11\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u5728\u751f\u6001\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "research_question": "\u7267\u6c11\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u662f\u5426\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u6548\u7387\uff08\u751f\u6001\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u7267\u6c11\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u8349\u539f\u755c\u7267\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u8fc7\u5ea6\u653e\u7267\u3001\u4ea7\u6743\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u7267\u6c11\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6311\u6218\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u5236\u5ea6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d44\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u89c2\uff08RBV\uff09\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff08SLF\uff09\u3002", "method": "2022\u5e74\u5bf9\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u56db\u4e2a\u53bf\u7684223\u6237\u7267\u6c11\u5bb6\u5ead\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b18\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u71b5\u6743\u6cd5\u548cTobit\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u5728\u751f\u6001\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u7267\u6c11\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7980\u8d4b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RBV\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548cSLF\u5728\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u653e\u7267\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8349\u539f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u519c\u6751\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Current methods for knowledge transfer from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs) mainly align output logits. However, such approaches often overlook the rich semantic structures encoded in CNN features, thereby restricting ViTs from effectively inheriting the inductive biases inherent in convolutional architectures. To this end, this paper proposes a Feature-based CNN-to-ViT Structured Knowledge Distillation framework, dubbed FSKD, which combines the structured semantic knowledge embedded in CNN (teacher) features with the strength of ViT (student) in capturing long-range dependencies. Specifically, this framework includes a feature alignment module to bridge the representational gap between CNN and ViT features, and it incorporates a global feature alignment loss.

In this study, the impact of a severe G5 category geomagnetic storm that occurred on May 10-11, 2024, was analyzed using TEC data from 46 IGS observing stations located between 0\u00b0 N and 30\u00b0 N latitude. TEC variations, along with IRI-2020 model data and geomagnetic storm parameters (Bx, By, Bz, Dst, AE, and \u2211Kp indices), were statistically examined over six days, from May 9 to May 14, 2024. Additionally, the TEC variations were predicted using an ANN-based nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) model, which showed that the predicted TEC values more accurately matched the observed TEC data compared to the IRI-2020 model, as determined by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) method. No significant pre-storm activity was detected at any station. Almost all equatorial stations experienced TEC enhancements (up to +50 TECU) during the storm&apos;s main phase, indicating a positive effect. Outside the equatorial region, most stations showed a negative effect, with decreases up to -45 TECU. The impact of this geomagnetic storm was not uniformly distributed among all the observing stations. During the recovery phase, a few stations experienced rapid recovery. Overall, the analysis indicated a predominant negative effect of this geomagnetic storm. These anomalous TEC variations were explained through existing mechanisms and O/N2 ratio data, which showed a decrease during the main phase."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e862024\u5e745\u670810-11\u65e5G5\u7ea7\u5730\u78c1\u66b4\u5bf9\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u603b\u7535\u5b50\u542b\u91cf\uff08TEC\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u752846\u4e2aIGS\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\u6570\u636e\u548cNARX\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bTEC\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u78c1\u66b4\u5bf9\u8d64\u9053\u548c\u975e\u8d64\u9053\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "research_question": "G5\u7ea7\u5730\u78c1\u66b4\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u603b\u7535\u5b50\u542b\u91cf\uff08TEC\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5730\u78c1\u66b4\u5bf9\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eIRI-2020\u6a21\u578b\u548cNARX\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752846\u4e2aIGS\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408IRI-2020\u6a21\u578b\u548cNARX\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790TEC\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u8d64\u9053\u533a\u57dfTEC\u589e\u52a0\uff08+50 TECU\uff09\uff0c\u975e\u8d64\u9053\u533a\u57dfTEC\u51cf\u5c11\uff08-45 TECU\uff09\uff0c\u5730\u78c1\u66b4\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86NARX\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4bTEC\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5730\u78c1\u66b4\u5bf9\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, current SLB deployments in mobile energy storage systems (MESS) neither integrate investment planning nor accommodate real\u2011time scheduling under battery degradation and operational uncertainty. To this end, this paper proposes a method for deploying SLB in MESS that integrates investment planning with pre\u2011scheduling. First, a framework for deploying SLB within MESS is introduced. Additionally, to enhance the usability of SLB in MESS, a safe region concept is proposed, which considers the lifespan of SLB and is integrated into both the investment planning and pre-scheduling frameworks. Building upon this, a joint solution method combining distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and reinforcement learning (RL) is introduced, effectively bridging long-term investment planning with real-time scheduling.

Through data analysis using SmartPLS 3.0 software, the study discovered two new contributions: (i) FOMO positively affects green consumption intention through the mediating role of attitude, motivation, and subjective norm; and (ii) subjective norm plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between motivation and green consumption intention. These findings contribute significantly to the theoretical framework of young people&apos;s consumption behavior.

However, precise forecasting of earthquake occurrence times remains a significant challenge, often affected by noise, model drift, and the absence of adaptive correction mechanisms in existing models. This study develops a novel prediction architecture to enhance the accuracy of earthquake occurrence time forecasting by addressing these limitations. We propose a hybrid method that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with a Kalman Filter. This approach estimates earthquake occurrence times from historical seismic timestamp data and incorporates a dynamic, adaptive error correction mechanism using real-time feedback from the Kalman Filter. The proposed hybrid LSTM-Kalman filter method outperformed the baseline standard LSTM and Attention-based LSTM models for timestamp prediction. It achieved lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values, alongside a coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) of 0.9998, indicating a strong agreement between actual and predicted values. Visualizations further corroborate the hybrid model&apos;s precision in tracking actual times and its stable error distribution. Nevertheless, the model&apos;s performance in magnitude prediction remains limited. In conclusion, integrating a Kalman Filter into the LSTM architecture effectively mitigates variance and reduces forecasting drift in earthquake time prediction, offering a reliable tool for temporal forecasting. This capability has significant implications for advancing earthquake Early Warning Systems (EWS) in earthquake-prone areas by enabling more precise and timely alerts, ultimately contributing to improved disaster response and minimized casualties."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5730\u9707\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u9707\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5730\u9707\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5730\u9707\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u707e\u5bb3\u51c6\u5907\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LSTM\uff09\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408LSTM-\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u9707\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "findings": "\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0cR\u00b2\u8fbe\u52300.9998\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5728LSTM\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5730\u9707\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4f24\u4ea1\u3002"}}

However, rural supply chains face significant challenges during their digital transformation, including weak supplier integration, poor information flow, and inadequate organizational capacity. This paper uses Bainiu Village in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, as a case study, employing a longitudinal research approach grounded in a power structure perspective to examine how digitalization reshapes rural supply chains and facilitates the collaborative evolution of both power and organizational structures. The findings reveal that: (1) The evolution of the rural supply chain\u2019s organizational structure progresses through three stages: from a \"single-core fan-shaped supply chain\" to a \"single-core cluster supply chain,\" and ultimately to a \"multi-core cluster supply chain.\" The underlying power structure has also undergone a continuous evolutionary process, from \"platform unilateral monopoly, farmer dependence\" to \"platform monopoly strengthening, enterprise labor division deepening,\" followed by \"multi-platform competition\" and finally, \"enterprise autonomous decentralization.\" (2) In line with this, the supply chain adopts distinct organizational coordination strategies at each stage, including \"verbal agreements and kinship networks,\" \"formal contracts and professional labor division,\" and \"strategic alliances and cross-platform collaboration.\" (3) Moreover, the study develops an analytical framework based on the \"context-action-result\" model, illustrating how multi-dimensional collaboration strategies reconstruct power structures and drive the evolution of organizational forms in response to shifts in external conditions. This paper not only enriches theoretical research on the interplay between power structures and organizational evolution in the context of digitalization, but also provides practical insights into enhancing the resilience and competitiveness of rural supply chains."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ee5\u676d\u5dde\u767d\u725b\u6751\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ece\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ef4\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "research_question": "\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\uff1f", "motivation": "\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u6574\u5408\u5f31\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u4e0d\u7545\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6f14\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7eb5\u5411\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u676d\u5dde\u767d\u725b\u6751\u4e3a\u4f8b\u3002", "findings": "\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u60c5\u5883-\u884c\u52a8-\u7ed3\u679c\u201d\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6f14\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

As electricity grids become more dynamic due to the increasing penetration of renewable generation, data centers represent a promising but underutilized source of demand-side flexibility. This paper presents a quantitative framework to assess and activate the flexibility potential of data centers by deferring non-critical, high-latency IT workloads. Using real-world workload traces from the Alibaba Cluster Trace dataset, tasks are classified based on observed queuing latency, and a power model is developed to estimate energy consumption associated with different latency groups. A Latency-Aware Deferral for Flexibility (LAD-Flex) strategy is proposed to temporarily reduce data center power consumption in response to aggregator requests, while maintaining quality of service. The strategy accounts for estimated task duration, latency thresholds, and flexibility window constraints. Results from a one-week case study show that up to 22% of load can be deferred during flexibility windows, and that more than 20% of total data center power is attributable to tasks with deferrable latency. Additionally, an optimization framework is introduced to identify the notification period that maximizes the value of flexibility under a time-sensitive pricing scheme. The findings demonstrate that data centers, coupled with an aggregator, can reliably participate in short-notice demand response by leveraging workload-aware deferral strategies, offering both operational and economic benefits."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08LAD-Flex\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u975e\u5173\u952e\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdfIT\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u975e\u5173\u952e\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdfIT\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6765\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u4f7f\u7535\u7f51\u66f4\u5177\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\u4fa7\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7535\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLatency-Aware Deferral for Flexibility (LAD-Flex)\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Alibaba Cluster Trace\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u7535\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLAD-Flex\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u4e00\u5468\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c22%\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53ef\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c20%\u7684\u603b\u529f\u8017\u6765\u81ea\u53ef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548cLAD-Flex\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u9700\u6c42\u4fa7\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53c2\u4e0e\u77ed\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53cc\u91cd\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that restricting worker access to available resources (including salary) is a novel form of destructive leadership, which we call \u201cstingy\u201d leadership. Stingy leadership is characterized by leaders who, despite resource availability, provide the absolute minimum resources allowed by law, for their employees. In developing stingy leadership, we drew on moral psychology to show that stingy leadership is distinct from abusive supervision and exploitative leadership because its harm is indirect and it does not stem from anger or callousness, but a misguided moral virtue. Nevertheless, stingy leadership creates compromises workplace outcomes (e.g., productivity, organizational citizenship behaviors, commitment).

Our objective is to provide a multilevel and integrative theoretical framework that synthesizes and integrates the literature across various levels of analysis, including intrapersonal, between-personal, interpersonal, group, organizational, and multilevel perspectives. The framework we propose incorporates the antecedents and outcomes of leadership contagion, variables that explain the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, and the boundary effects that explain the conditions under which the leadership contagion mechanism may change. Through our review, we identify significant research gaps associated with the selection of different theories by researchers studying leadership contagion at multiple levels of analysis. We also highlight the need for a thorough investigation into the underlying mechanism of leadership contagion, theoretical and multilevel analysis, and the adoption of various methodological approaches to address these research gaps. Accordingly, we provide a detailed research agenda for future scholars, including the need to propose an integrative framework that specifies the unique cognitive, affective, and behavioral contagion mechanisms through which contagion effects is expected to be transmitted from leaders to followers, the need to understand better the \u201ctipping point\u201d of leader contagion versus leader counter-contagion, and the need for methodological approaches that will help address these substantive knowledge gaps in leadership contagion.

Unlike machining processes, this technology exhibits distinct chatter generation mechanisms due to its heavy-load and low-frequency characteristics. Consequently, existing chatter suppression method such as spindle speed variation, damped anti-vibration tool holders, and tuned mass dampers, are failed in RPF.After revealing chatter generation mechanism of robotic plastic forming, this study proposes a multi-DoF chatter suppression method through adding three spatial hydraulic actuators and actively control the damping of them.  In this way,\u00a0real-time chatter stability is assessed to identify chatter-susceptible direction, trigger coordinated control of three hydraulic actuators to enhance damping in the critical direction.First, a dynamic model of RPF processes\u00a0was developed, accounting for the complex geometric contact between blank and tool\u00a0and\u00a0the multi-DoF coupled damping of the forming system.\u00a0Subsequently, chatter mechanism in the\u00a0RPF was revealed through vibration analysis, showing that chatter\u00a0is originated\u00a0from negative damping effects.\u00a0Based on the negative damping state of the RPF, a novel chatter stability index was developed to predict multi-DoF chatter,\u00a0enabling prediction of\u00a0chatter frequency, direction, and conditions. Furthermore, an active damping compensation-based chatter suppression method\u00a0using coordinated control of three hydraulic actuators\u00a0was proposed.\u00a0Finally, experiments were conducted,\u00a0in which\u00a0the accuracy of the chatter prediction model\u00a0was validated\u00a0and the effectiveness of the chatter suppression method\u00a0was demonstrated,\u00a0with\u00a093% amplitude attenuation at the chatter frequency."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5851\u6027\u6210\u5f62\uff08RPF\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u518d\u751f\u98a4\u632f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6db2\u538b\u6267\u884c\u5668\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u963b\u5c3c\u7684\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u98a4\u632f\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5851\u6027\u6210\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u518d\u751f\u98a4\u632f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u98a4\u632f\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RPF\u4e2d\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8f7d\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u963b\u5c3c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u98a4\u632f\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u98a4\u632f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6db2\u538b\u6267\u884c\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u98a4\u632f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u98a4\u632f\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693%\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RPF\u4e2d\u7684\u98a4\u632f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u98a4\u632f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u98a4\u632f\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eRPF\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Therefore, optimizing energy consumption in the condenser water loop is a key to reducing operating cost and carbon emission. In this study, a physics-based simulator was developed for the system using historical operational data, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 2.11% when validating the total energy consumption of six-month operational data. Utilizing the simulator, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization was performed to minimize the total energy consumption. Results demonstrated that utilizing variable speed equipment can further reduce the total energy consumption by 3.2%, compared to optimal operations relying solely on full-load conditions. Specifically, energy savings for pumps and fans were 15.7% and 29.6%, respectively, when variable speed equipment was employed. Additionally, an energy-saving potential by optimally distributing the water flow rates across cooling towers with multi-speed fans was investigated. The optimal distribution enhanced the overall performance of cooling towers under a specific operating condition, decreasing condenser water temperature, thereby leading to a decrease in chiller power consumption. Lastly, a rule-based semi-optimal control logic that makes the implementation straightforward was proposed, derived from insights into optimal operation characteristics. The proposed logic was able to reproduce optimal operations without compromising the amount of saving energy (< 0.1%) in comparison with the GA-identified optimal operations."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5de5\u5382\u51b7\u51dd\u6c34\u56de\u8def\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53d8\u901f\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u8282\u7ea6\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5de5\u5382\u51b7\u51dd\u6c34\u56de\u8def\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u51b7\u51dd\u6c34\u56de\u8def\u5360\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5de5\u5382\u603b\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u80fd\u8017\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u8fd0\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "findings": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u901f\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u603b\u80fd\u80173.2%\uff0c\u6cf5\u548c\u98ce\u6247\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u4e3a15.7%\u548c29.6%\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u51b7\u5374\u5854\u6c34\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u51b7\u51dd\u6c34\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5236\u51b7\u673a\u529f\u8017\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u534a\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u8282\u7ea6\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}
