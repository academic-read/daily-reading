Existing research on waste reduction, however, has largely overlooked the non-linear factors influencing waste generation and the complexities of multi-product manufacturing. Given these gaps, our research develops a decisionmaking model that utilizes non-linear artificial intelligence (AI), explainable AI and simulation-based algorithm to identify waste sources and devise tailored reduction actions. Validated with production data from a leading battery manufacturer, our model prioritizes non-recyclable waste reduction by capturing variations in waste generation even in production processes that do not directly generate waste. The validation result suggests that the actions selected by our multi-product oriented model achieve more substantial improvement compared to existing linear models or single-product-focused approach. It improves the average super-efficiency DEA score from 0.95 to 1.23 (a 29.5% efficiency gain), while the proportion of non-recyclable waste decreased from 7.4% to 5.9%, demonstrating our model's superior performance in reducing waste and improving efficiency. For a 11 GWh factory, this translates to an estimated annual saving of $3.3 million in waste disposal costs. Accordingly, our research advances the production and process improvement literature on battery manufacturing by integrating a non-linear method to identify waste sources and adapting waste reduction strategies to the multi-product scenario. Additionally, by combining conventional AI with explainable AI, our decision-making model has better interpretability for the predictions of waste generation, offering a robust and practical method for waste reduction in battery production."}}

Following the unprecedented shift to digital learning platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions now store vast amounts of sensitive student data while frequently lacking robust security measures. We analyse the primary threats students face, including data breaches, phishing attacks, invasive monitoring tools, and vulnerabilities in outdated EdTech platforms. The research reveals that students are particularly susceptible to these threats due to limited cybersecurity awareness, poor digital hygiene practices, and inadequate institutional protections. Through examination of global case studies, including the 2021 Blackbaud ransomware attack affecting multiple universities and the University of York data breach, we highlight both the failures and successes in educational cybersecurity. The paper proposes comprehensive measures for educational institutions and EdTech companies, including implementing strong encryption, providing cybersecurity training, conducting regular security audits, and establishing ethical boundaries for student monitoring. As digital learning becomes permanently integrated into educational systems worldwide, this research underscores the urgent need for collaborative efforts between educational institutions, technology developers, and regulatory bodies to create secure learning environments that protect student data and privacy."}}

This study investigates whether and how blockchain engagement alters firms' structural dependence on supply chain partners. Grounded in transaction cost economics, we conceptualize blockchain as a transaction-cost-reducing technology that lowers search, contracting, and monitoring costs, thereby enabling firms to reduce dependence on specific suppliers or customers. To identify causal effects, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment based on the staggered enactment of blockchain-supportive laws across U.S. states. Using two complementary difference-indifferences (DiD) estimators (specifically, a two-way fixed effects model and a two-stage DiD estimator), we find that firms exposed to such laws experience a significant reduction in both upstream and downstream dependence, with effects ranging from 6.7% to 15.0% relative to sample means. These findings are robust to double/debiased machine learning and a series of additional sensitivity checks. Further analyses reveal that blockchain's de-dependence effect is more pronounced in firms with higher levels of blockchain awareness or when managers are guided by risk-averse incentive structures. In extension analyses, we identify three distinct strategies through which firms likely operationalize the de-dependence: partner termination, multi-sourcing, and reduced collaboration intensity. We also uncover a mutual dedependence effect: blockchain not only reduces focal firms' dependence on partners, but also lowers partners' dependence on the firm. Overall, our findings offer novel evidence on how blockchain reshapes supply chain dependence, highlighting its strategic role in enabling interorganizational agility and reducing relational lock-in."}}

Solving MP models relies on solver tools and scales up to millions of variables and constraints. The task of developing an MP model involves addressing subproblems such as discovering an MP model from domain knowledge, conformance checking of a candidate MP model with domain knowledge, and enhancing an invalid MP model based on domain knowledge. Traditionally, experts manually perform these tasks, leading to iterative processes that are both labor-intensive and error-prone. Recent literature highlights an emerging field of algorithms focused on automating MP model development using domain knowledge artifacts, which we jointly term MP model mining and divide into discovery, conformance checking, and enhancement problems. This study organizes and analyzes existing knowledge on MP model mining, aiming to elucidate the state of the art and pinpoint current gaps and challenges. Through a systematic review via an acknowledged literature search engine, we address 29 research questions concerning various dimensions, identify 16 knowledge gaps, and propose a future research agenda."}}

We use data from 21 unique, in-depth qualitative interviews on solo and social (i.e., joint) transfers into new jobs, combined with handpicked LinkedIn and media data on over 200 employees. We conduct crisp set qualitative comparative analysis (csQCA), and we find that social networks have limited relevance, compared to internal strategic action, as a core condition enabling comobility. In contrast, we find that in the absence of comobility, solo movers into new jobs are more likely to rely on their social networks instead of strategic action."}}

Our findings cast doubt on the accuracy of 990-mission data. It is a poor proxy for public mission statements.

To address this need, this paper develops a modeling approach and solution procedure to identify Pareto-optimal designs. We focus on design parameters of practical interest, namely, fare policies and microtransit fleet size. To explore these trade-offs, we propose a bi-level and bi-objective (i.e., minimize taxpayer subsidy and maximize mobility-based consumer welfare) modeling framework, with an agent-based transportation system simulation model at the lower level and a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (BO) model at the upper level. We apply the modeling and solution approach to Lemon Grove, California (a suburban area in San Diego County). Results reveal a diverse set of solutions along the Pareto frontier, indicating that some naive microtransit fare strategies are suboptimal. Notably, Pareto-optimal designs feature a 50-100% discount for microtransit to FRT transfers, as well as peak-period fare multipliers between 1.8x and 3.5x to manage time-varying demand effectively."}}

This adverse selection may arise because individuals with varying cognitive abilities may interpret autonomy-related signals in systematically different ways. Specifically, lower-ability candidates may perceive autonomy at face value as desirable freedom from managerial oversight, whereas higher-ability individuals may infer potential organizational dysfunction, including ill-defined roles, insufficient managerial oversight, and unclear performance evaluation. Using large-scale job posting data, we first document that startups increasingly highlight autonomy in recruitment, particularly when targeting higher-ability talent. We then provide causal evidence for the proposed adverse selection through a field experiment conducted in partnership with a U.S.-based startup. Our findings reveal that, although autonomy is widely considered a desirable attribute that distinguishes new ventures from established firms, its explicit emphasis in startup recruitment may backfire—paradoxically deterring the high-ability candidates most critical to entrepreneurial success."}}

This allows communicating valuable insights and inspiring novel interpretations without inducing fixation. We empirically validate the proposed approach using a field experiment involving professional designers in a logo design contest. Results show that designers with AI intermediation produce (1) higher-quality work than those with no exposure to exemplars, and (2) more-original work than those with direct exposure to exemplars. We further decompose the sources of creativity and demonstrate that while the generative model yields distinct variations, human creativity remains pivotal for improving originality and quality of the final designs. Consequently, AI intermediation presents an efficient facilitator to human-driven creative process."}}

Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we identified that these structural patterns significantly contribute to false allocations, thus increasing the likelihood of audit discrepancies. For interpretability, we applied the method introduced by Lundberg and Lee in their seminal work, “A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions,” published in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30 (2017): 4765–4774."}}

The paper adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative case study analysis with quantitative indicators such as the Global Militarization Index (GMI), military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and the Multidimensional Measures of Militarization (M3). The study explores the political economy of military establishments, their constitutional and extraconstitutional roles, and the mechanisms-both visible and covert-through which they shape national policy. It introduces a Military Influence Index (MII) to systematically compare the countries based on institutional presence, economic control, policy dominance, and security enforcement. Findings reveal stark contrasts: countries like North Korea and Egypt exhibit overt military control, while in the United States, influence is institutional but restrained by civilian oversight. Pakistan and Algeria demonstrate hybrid models, where civilian governments function under latent or conditional military approval. The study highlights the global persistence of military influence in civilian governance and its implications for democratic consolidation, political accountability, and civil liberties."}}

The article defines future generations as a group of individuals that are yet to be born as well as children under 18 years of age because they lack political representation. The core of the argument proceeds in three steps: First, the article demonstrates that action or inaction harmful to the climate constitutes age discrimination. Future generations are a vulnerable group in the sense of nondiscrimination law because they suffer from political disadvantage due to their underrepresentation in the political process. Second, measures harming the climate are usually indirect discrimination. International human rights bodies generally recognize that indirect discrimination can violate non-discrimination norms. Saving costs today by imposing them on future generations would not be an adequate justification because of the power-asymmetry between present and future generations. Finally, the article differentiates between state measures that harm the climate and inaction on climate change. Measures that are actively harmful, such as fossil fuel subsidies, can usually not be justified. When it comes to state inaction, courts often derive positive obligations from human rights norms. However, states enjoy a wide margin of appreciation. Therefore, courts cannot impose concrete obligations on states. They do not turn into an ersatz legislature. Instead, they can impose a general obligation to act that nudges the political process."}}

The results indicate that financial inclusion has a significant positive impact on bank performance, accounting for approximately 70.7% of the variation in bank performance. However, the relationship between financial inclusion and bank performance is mediated by financial development which plays a critical role in enhancing bank performance. The Sobel Test confirms that the mediation effect of financial development is statistically significant. The study's findings have important implications for policymakers and financial institutions seeking to promote financial inclusion and improve bank performance in sub-Saharan Africa.

We find that retail trading volume and the number of retail trades increase significantly following these events.

We also find that retail investors make larger net purchases when the newly released ESG ratings convey positive news and that subsequent net retail demand positively predicts future returns.

Designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar, these blockchain-based assets offer a compelling alternative to traditional fiat-based systems dominated by legacy payment processors like Visa and Mastercard. This paper examines how stablecoins address long-standing challenges in gaming payments, including high transaction fees, cross-border friction, and exclusion of underbanked populations-by enabling instant, transparent, and low-cost settlements. It also explores the transformative potential of stablecoin integration in future gaming ecosystems, including the tokenization of in-game assets and the rise of decentralized creator-driven economies. Through the lens of financial decentralization, institutional adoption, and global accessibility, this paper argues that stablecoins are positioned not merely as alternatives, but as essential infrastructure for the next generation of digital commerce in gaming and beyond."}}

This study therefore not only examines the effects of energy consumption and environmental sustainability, but also explores how the interaction between energy use and ecological sustainability influences FP in Africa. Data from 42 African countries, spanning the period 1990 to 2021, were analysed using the method of moments quantile regression technique. Empirically, the study demonstrates that improved energy use and ecological sustainability reduce FP in African economies, particularly in contexts where FP is less severe. However, the mitigating effect of environmental sustainability on FP is consistently greater than that of energy consumption across all quantiles. Conversely, the interaction between energy use and ecological sustainability reveals a reinforcing effect on FP. Further findings show that when food production is exclusionary, unsustainable, and exploitative, it exacerbates FP. Additionally, while income and population growth significantly intensify FP—particularly in African countries with low to moderate FP intensity—the effect of income is relatively marginal. Drawing on these findings, the study outlines policy interventions that African economies can adopt to address FP effectively.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>"}}

As inter-African and intra-African conflict ensued as a result of these interferences, international stakeholders turned to transitional justice as a primary mechanism of restoration and reconstruction in the early 1990s. Since then, Africa has witnessed almost half of its States adopt transitional justice measures, namely truth and reconciliation commissions (TRCs), with arguably little tangible success. This article explores the limitations of these former transitional justice processes, particularly their failure to prioritize the institution-building pillar of transitional justice, incorporate the voices of local citizens, and implement the formal recommendations of TRC final reports—which are often the manifestations of years of research and community engagement. A crucial first step in ensuring the effectiveness of transitional justice processes in Africa is building on the efforts of existing institutions and local expertise to overcome challenges on the ground. In so doing, this article emphasizes the power and potential for positive change through the international community and African governments seriously monitoring the implementation of recommendations that emerge from the transitional justice process. Genuine commitment to the transitional justice process in Africa must be demonstrated not only in initiating transitional justice but also in reacting effectively to the findings of the process to combat the fragility of African states in governance, public trust, and the rule of law."}}

By extending concepts like consumer surplus, producer surplus, deadweight loss, and externalities into a dynamic context, Dynamic CBA provides a richer understanding of welfare impacts than traditional static methods. Challenges to implementation include contending with uncertainty, discounting controversies, and institutional resistance to change.

The Order is made pursuant to section 81 of the Proceeds of Crime (Recovery and Management) Act, 2022 (POCA). The study highlighted the growing prevalence of copyright infringements. The highlight includes their significant economic implications, particularly in the digital era where such offences can presumably be linked to organised crime and money laundering. The objective was to examine how NCC's powers have evolved from traditional civil enforcement to include criminal prosecution and asset recovery within Nigeria's broader anti-money laundering framework. The research found that copyright offences, while not explicitly listed as predicate offences under anti-money laundering laws, are effectively treated as such due to their association with illicit financial gains. It further found that the designation of NCC under POCA is to enhance enforcement capabilities. This will empower NCC to conduct asset tracing, seizure, and management connected to copyright violations. The study recommended strengthening institutional collaboration between NCC and financial intelligence agencies, improving legal frameworks to explicitly include copyright offences as predicate crimes, and enhancing capacity-building for effective enforcement. In conclusion, NCC's integrated enforcement role is pivotal in disrupting the economic benefits of copyright crime and advancing Nigeria's fight against organised economic offences."}}

This research explores whether Indian youth are genuinely willing to spend the same amount on Indian brands as they do on international ones. Drawing insights from a primary survey of over 125 respondents aged 15 to 25, the study captures authentic youth perspectives on brand preference and spending behavior. It also incorporates secondary research from sources such as Mintel, McKinsey &amp; Company, and the Boston Consulting Group to frame the findings within a broader economic and psychological context. The results highlight a thoughtful but cautious consumer mindset. While many young Indians express patriotic sentiments and a growing willingness to support local products, their purchasing decisions are still significantly influenced by perceived quality, social pressure, and the aspirational appeal of foreign labels. Indian brands are steadily gaining trust and traction-particularly in food, personal care, and apparel-but will need to continue building credibility and emotional resonance to compete with established global names fully."}}

It proposes a dualistic structure: a democratically elected Legislative Administration for day-today governance, and an appointed Stewardship Council of non-political experts to safeguard the nation's long-term interests. After detailing the structure and its inherent challenge-a legitimacy crisis between democratic will and technocratic authority-the paper introduces a final integrating mechanism: a periodic, public performance review of Council members by a cross-party parliamentary committee.

Our method does not rely on a completely clean normal training set and can effectively model the distribution of normal data and detect anomalies even in the presence of contamination.

The model also incorporates various household appliances, including controllable, thermostatically controlled, rigid-load, and uncontrollable devices.The proposed HEMS aims to minimize energy costs and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) and enhance thermal comfort. To effectively manage uncertainties specifically in real-time electricity pricing (RTP), the initial state of charge (SOC) of the plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), solar radiation, and ambient temperature, a robust optimization (RO) approach is adopted and integrated with the augmented ε-constraint (AUGMENCON) technique to address the multi-objective challenge. One of the main contributions of this research lies in integrating RO with AUGMENCON, where RO ensures solution resilience under worst-case uncertainty, and AUGMENCON effectively maps the Pareto front. The relative ideal distance (RID) index method is used to identify the most balanced trade-off point along the Pareto front. The outcomes of the simulations indicate that, even under worst-case scenarios,  the developed framework results in a 34.52% decrease in energy cost, a 7.5% reduction in PAR, and a 91.5% improvement in thermal comfort, highlighting the model&apos;s effectiveness in resilient and efficient home energy management."}}

We model democracy as a latent, unobservable state and propose a new approach rooted in the logic of the \"wisdom of crowds\" to address these issues. We show that including a broader and more diverse set of observers - including non-experts - can improve inference.

This analysis looks at how the conflict started in 2014, tracing back the years of tension between Russia and NATO especially around Ukraine's desire to move closer to the West. The war has made it clear that international rules are only as strong as countries willing to follow them. It also demonstrates that global organizations like the UN often fall short in preventing these wars as Russia ignored widespread international condemnation and the Security Council was unable to act in due time to avert such crisis. The analysis digs into the far-reaching effects of the war-Western sanctions on Russia's economy but also pushed Russia to find new partners outside the Western sphere thereby making the world more divided. As new alliances are forming, some openly challenged democratic values creating more diverse opinions on the fundamental human right principles. All of these points to serious weaknesses in the security arrangements built after the Cold War, creating more conflicts amongst states. As countries find it difficult to cooperate in a delicate world order, instability and security dilemma often result from such a situation. Using ideas from realist thinkers such as Waltz and Morgenthau advocating power between states as a means of survival, critics of unchecked power like Bull and Mearsheimer often underline the need for cooperation in upholding a peaceful security environment. This study argues that the Ukrainian crisis is a major security test for the global security community, and it continues to divide global community in search for a common solution. Unless there are real changes to fix power imbalances between states and the flaws in international institutions, the current security atmosphere might be heading toward a fractured and chaotic world order. The paper calls for a fresh look at how peace can be maintained in a self-help security environment and opine cooperation as an inclusive policy in a world that's growing more complex and multipolar."}}

Exploring current approaches to macroprudential policy, we find similarities with the financial instability hypothesis of Hyman Minsky that mainly relied on the endogenous nature of the crisis, the danger of excessive credit, and the financial stability paradox, developed long before the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Reviewing the set of academic papers investigating the effectiveness of EWS, we find that most of the indicators recognized in the research as effective are consistent with Minsky's approach since they bring forward the endogenous nature of instabilities. Moreover, it is obvious that one indicator cannot be considered as a universal predictor of crises. A set of indicators is required to allow an effective macroprudential policy. We propose an EWS framework where crisis is the result of the occurrence of financial vulnerability and trigger events. The resulting EWS framework is consistent with Minsky's approach and points to the endogenous nature of the evolution of credit to finance market expectations as the main vulnerability of financial stability."}}

This paper introduces the Financial Markets Stress Indicator for Slovenia (FIMSIS), the first composite financial stress indicator developed specifically for the Slovenian financial system. FIMSIS aggregates volatility-based indicators across market segments using three alternative approaches-exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), multivariate GARCH (BEKK) and principal component analysis (PCA)-allowing for a comparative evaluation of aggregation techniques. The indicator captures both the intensity and systemic dimension of financial stress and is evaluated through robustness checks and regime classification using a Markov-switching model. To assess predictive performance, we apply a Growth-at-Risk framework with Adaptive LASSO and non-crossing constraints. Results confirm FIMSIS's relevance for signalling downside macroeconomic risk."}}

This paper investigates the methodologies for developing NFD product standards that align with the Paris Agreement and broader global sustainability goals. Based on a cross disciplinary narrative review, the paper synthesizes insights from environmental science, business studies, and social science to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of dominant methodologies, including Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE), and Impact-Weighted Accounts (IWA). The prevailing NFD practices fail to adequately address the foundational principles of sustainable development-equity, inclusion, and the needs of socially and economically disadvantaged groups. The paper advocates for a political industrial-ecological (PIE) approach that integrates quantitative environmental tools with social science perspectives to address the shortcomings of current NFD systems. By bridging industrial ecology and political ecology, this framework can enhance the credibility, transparency, and fairness of NFD standards and better align them with both the goals of the Paris Agreement and social realities."}}

Drawing on secondary sources, policy documents, platform regulations, and labor protests, it examines how the Iranian state actively promotes digital platforms as a strategy to absorb surplus labor and mitigate unemployment amidst economic crisis. Unlike gig platforms operating in liberal economies, Snapp! is embedded in a state-controlled and militarized economy, benefiting from regulatory privileges, foreign capital channeled through parastatal entities, and impunity from labor oversight. The chapter shows how Snapp! enforces labor discipline through a combination of algorithmic management, formal legal penalties, and ethnic segmentation, enabling unprecedented levels of wage suppression and worker control. Workers classified as “driver users” are excluded from legal protections and subjected to opaque performance-based sanctions, while surveillance technologies and political repression preempt collective organizing. Despite these constraints, Snapp! drivers have staged strikes, digital campaigns, and protest actions, demonstrating the persistent agency of precarious workers under authoritarian conditions. However, the state-platform alliance has systematically suppressed these efforts through digital retaliation and legal threats. The chapter argues that Snapp! institutionalizes a uniquely repressive model of gig labor in which digital innovation serves not as a vehicle of economic empowerment, but as a mechanism of labor containment. By foregrounding Iran’s case, the chapter challenges dominant global narratives that frame platform labor primarily through deregulation, revealing how authoritarian states repurpose digital capitalism to deepen labor precarity and political control.&nbsp;"}}

While bookmaker odds tend to exhibit superior statistical calibration, the xG-based model captures certain signals not fully reflected in market prices. In simulated betting, the model yields a return on investment of approximately 10% using average market odds, increasing to nearly 15% under the best available prices.

This paper investigates the use of gRPC for high-performance IPC in .NET-based microservices architectures. By comparing gRPC with REST API and RabbitMQ, we evaluate its performance under varying load conditions, focusing on throughput, latency, and availability. The results highlight that gRPC outperforms REST API in scenarios requiring low latency and high throughput, while RabbitMQ provides better scalability in asynchronous communication models. Despite the performance benefits, gRPC introduces complexities in its implementation and development, particularly due to its reliance on Protocol Buffers. The paper concludes that gRPC is a highly suitable option for microservices requiring fast and reliable communication, with recommendations for future research into its integration with other systems and message brokers."}}

Using farmlevel data and landscape-level land cover information, we assess the impact of natural land cover types on farmland value across five Euro-Mediterranean countries considering farms specializing in crops and livestock. Our research extends previous studies by offering a more comprehensive economic analysis that incorporates multiple ecosystem types and applies a novel approach, the relative shift method, to account for the compositional nature of land use data. Our findings contribute to the land-sharing versus land-sparing debate. We find that all natural land classes have a positive impact on farmland value for the whole sample, thus supporting the land-sharing approach. However, when focusing exclusively on crop farms, peat bogs exhibit a negative impact on farmland value, suggesting that a land-sparing strategy may be more appropriate in such contexts. In addition we found substantial differences across farm types when assessing the impact of policy reallocating land from agriculture to natural cover, underscoring the need for targeted land management strategies."}}

We find evidence of racial discrimination: White investors receive meeting approvals 34% more often than Black investors. This disparity persists across investor types, suggesting taste-based rather than statistical discrimination. Gender discrimination manifests differently-we find no statistically significant differences in initial meeting access, but conditional on securing meetings, female investors are 62% less likely to be offered a meeting with C-suite executives. Investor type alone does not affect meeting access, challenging assumptions about the differential treatment of retail investors versus professional investors. These findings reveal that informal barriers to information access vary systematically by investor characteristics, advancing our understanding of discrimination in financial markets and providing insight into the landscape of corporate information access."}}

The main purpose of the research is to analyse and examine the intellectual property provisions currently in existence within the states of the GCC. The aim is to provide recommendations to improve the current level of intellectual property protection at both a national level and at a state level in the GCC through an integrated intellectual property protection model. There have been three main stages in the development of intellectual property in the Gulf states; a pre Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) stage, the current level of TRIPS compliance and a push towards TRIPS Plus. To date, each individual Gulf state has developed its intellectual property laws at varying rates. Post 2000, the Gulf states all display a set of intellectual property laws that are largely compliant with TRIPS. Therefore a question arises as to how much scope there is in the current laws to accede to more stringent intellectual property provisions. The research will show this is a key question for the GCC, its international partners and the wider trading communities of the WTO. The findings of the research are that the GCC does not have the capacity to take on TRIPS Plus provisions without compromising its sharia laws and value and that instead an integrated intellectual property protection model is needed."}}

Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach, the analysis confirms a significant long-term relationship between key stock market variables-particularly paid-up capital and the number of listed companies-and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These findings highlight the crucial role of capital accumulation and market expansion in promoting sustained economic growth. In contrast, variables such as market capitalization, turnover, and government education expenditure showed limited or no significant influence on Nepal's economic growth in the long run. The short-run analysis revealed that real market capitalization has a significant but negative effect on GDP, while turnover was insignificant, indicating that short-term market fluctuations may not directly support economic development. Diagnostic tests confirmed the robustness and stability of the econometric model, while Granger causality tests indicated both bidirectional and unidirectional causal relationships between stock market indicators and economic growth. Based on these findings, the study recommends policy interventions focused on strengthening capital formation, promoting market listings and investor participation, improving market efficiency and investor protection, integrating financial and human capital development, and enhancing financial infrastructure and institutional frameworks. By implementing these policies, Nepal can better harness its stock market as a driver of inclusive and sustainable economic growth."}}

Nonetheless, modeling intricate temporal relationships and scale-aware dynamics across long horizons remains inherently difficult. Existing methods often struggle to balance temporal patterns with computational efficiency. Two major challenges remain: First, Transformer-based models, while effective in modeling long-range dependencies, suffer from quadratic complexity, hindering their scalability to ultra-long sequences. Second, existing multi-scale architectures often process different temporal resolutions independently, neglecting high-order interactions between coarse and fine-grained features. To address these issues, we propose DMTI-BiMamba, a novel forecasting framework that proposes a Decomposed Multi-scale Temporal-channel Interaction with Bidirectional Mamba. Specifically, the input sequence is decomposed into structural evolutions and periodic patterns. A multi-scale architecture Temporal-channel Interaction module is applied to the structural evolution component to extract hierarchical temporal dependencies at different resolutions. At the same time, an innovative bidirectional Mamba module captures long-range dynamics in both forward and backwards directions to reduce cumulative error for periodic pattern components. This model ensures both computational efficiency and modeling expressiveness. Extensive experiments on eight public datasets across multiple forecasting horizons demonstrate that DMTI-BiMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and robustness, outperforming existing baselines, including Transformer-based, linear models, and graph-based methods."}}

To address these challenges, extensive efforts have been devoted to neural network pruning, activation sparsity induction, and specialized hardware accelerators. Among them, regularization-based activation sparsity induction is a promising yet underexplored direction. Existing methods often exhibit limited sparsity gains, poor sparsity–accuracy trade-off, and weak generalization. These limitations largely stem from the lack of systematic analysis in the introduction of regularizers. In this work, we first conduct an empirical analysis to identify the key properties of effective activation sparsity regularizers—namely, the ability to suppress small activations while preserving distribution continuity. Guided by these insights, we propose to introduce Transformed ℓ1 (Tℓ1) as a principled regularizer for inducing activation sparsity. Further, we propose a dual sparse training pipeline that integrates traditional pruning and activation sparsity induction in a three-stage design. The pipeline jointly enhances static sparsity in weights and dynamic sparsity in activations, thereby improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets show that Tℓ1 improves activation sparsity by over 20% without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, it improves sparsity by 27.52% on ResNet-18 (ImageNet-1K) and 44.04% on LeNet-5 (MNIST). In addition, the proposed pipeline reduces floating-point operations by 81.70% on ResNet-18 and 84.13% on ResNet-50. A case study on Flexagon, an accelerator supporting sparse–sparse matrix multiplication, demonstrates that the dual sparse model achieves up to 1.46x lower inference latency under identical weight sparsity levels."}}

To isolate their effects, we experimentally manipulate ambiguity levels in the problem’s design and elicit participants’ beliefs about others’ contributions in a public good game, using a representative sample (n = 1,500) of the Spanish population. Participants decide how much to contribute to a public good game and predict group members’ contributions. Our results highlight the decisive role of strategic uncertainty: individuals who perceive greater dispersion in peers’ contributions tend to cooperate more, though this relation weakens at higher expected contributions. Conversely, ambiguity (regarding the game’s parameters) has no significant impact on contributions or beliefs. Thus, our findings suggest that the fragility of collective action arises primarily from uncertainty regarding others’ behavior, rather than from inherent uncertainties in the nature of the problem itself."}}

For this reason, strengthening EU equity markets as an alternative funding source has been a policy priority under the Capital Markets Union (CMU) agenda, and more recently a key feature of the Savings and Investment Union (SIU). EU listed equity markets are smaller and structurally different from those in the United States (US), with differing market capitalisations of listed firms and differences in the number of companies listed, stemming from lower initial public offering (IPO) activity in Europe. This paper aims to understand the drivers behind the EU-US listing gap, focusing on two aspects: (1) the general firm-level benefits of listing, and (2) whether pre-listing financing opportunities in the EU are underdeveloped, hindering firm growth and ultimately market depth. This paper first puts forward an empirical analysis to assess how a firm’s decision to list impacts various key performance indicators, with a view to assessing the implications of listing for the economy at large. Second, it zooms in on innovative firms to shed light on the primary challenges faced by EU startups in their funding pipelines, with a focus on late-stage equity financing and venture capital (VC) markets. Focusing on the euro area (EA) as a proxy to derive broader benefits of listing in the EU, we find that EA companies’ key profitability measures, employment, innovation capacity and productivity all increase after listing – and are thus indicative of wider economic benefits. This is, however, associated with challenges for the long-term investment strategies of listed companies, such as potential short-termism – a topic widely studied in the literature. Moreover, a comparison with the US suggests that, while the benefits and risks of listing are qualitatively similar on the other side of the Atlantic, EA companies seem to benefit somewhat less from listing than their US peers.

Results reveal strong regional interdependence (73.60% total spillover index) with Lima as the dominant net transmitter (23.94 percentage points). However, frequency decomposition uncovers striking cyclical heterogeneity: Lima receives short-run shocks from food-producing regions but dominates long-run transmission (44.70% vs. 28.99% frequency spillover index). Rolling-window analysis during COVID-19 shows temporary spillover disruption (connectivity declining from 75% to 68%) followed by recovery during 2022's inflationary surge. Robustness checks across specifications, granular city-level data, and three-band frequency segmentation confirm Lima's structural centrality at lower frequencies. These findings validate the Central Reserve Bank's Lima-centered approach for long-run targeting while revealing asymmetric frequency-dependent spillovers.

Using a ninevariable SVAR augmented with narrative sign restrictions for the 1985-2023 period, we investigate whether the housing-output trade-off in monetary policy remains stable across conventional and unconventional policy environments. We find that while the magnitude of monetary policy effects varies substantially across regimes, a fundamental relationship persists: house prices respond approximately three to four times more than output to monetary shocks. During the GFC, both effects amplify proportionally, while COVID-19 weakens transmission channels without improving the trade-off ratio. Identification of house price shocks reveals that central banks already respond endogenously to housing developments, yet unfavorable trade-offs remain. These findings demonstrate that the constraint on using monetary policy for housing market stabilization represents a structural feature that transcends specific economic conditions."}}

In doing so, we hypothesize and find an association between health-related patents and publications on one hand, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs), on the other. Using a panel data model on a sample of 70 countries from 2000 to 2019, we found that health-related publications significantly contribute to the reduction of disease burden across both OECD members and other countries. However, in non-OECD countries we found no significant relationship between health-related patents and disease burden, which could be due to weaker Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) protection or a limited capability of the healthcare system to capture value from innovations. We also find no association between health innovations and the reduction of disease burden in adults, despite a significant association in other age groups."}}

However, current studies on the evolution of groundwater–soil–vegetation ecosystems in mining areas often overlook or overly simplify the complex nonlinear interactions among these components. This study takes the Bojianghaizi Basin in China as a case, using remote sensing inversion, hydrogeological surveys, soil habitat assessments, PCA-APCS-MLR, EWM, OLS models, and hydrogeochemical methods to compare groundwater-soil-vegetation system evolution under coal mining and natural conditions. The results reveal that groundwater in coal mining areas is mainly Cl·SO₄-Na type, while natural areas are dominated by HCO₃-Ca type. Mining activities enhance the dissolution of calcium-magnesium minerals (e.g., feldspar, pyroxene), intensifying groundwater chemical changes compared to natural conditions.  Analysis using the PCA-APCS-MLR model attributes the factors influencing groundwater chemical characteristics in the study area to four main sources: evaporation concentration, water-rock interactions and ion exchange, agricultural pollution, acid production from the oxidation of sulfur-bearing ores, and other sources. Significant spatial differences exist in the coupling relationships between groundwater chemical characteristics (x1), soil characteristics (x2), and fraction vegetation coverage (FVC, y) on the north and south sides of the study area&apos;s lakes. The multiple regression models for the three variables in the mining-disturbed and naturally regulated areas, constructed using the EWM and OLS methods, are: yNorth=−210.246x1−37.228x2+124.727 (R2=0.607), ySouth=−142.642x1−60.186x2+105.574 (R2=0.784). These models show that groundwater chemical characteristics are the main driver of FVC changes in mining-disturbed areas, while soil characteristics play a more significant role in natural areas . This study can not only provide a scientific basis for the sustainable development of similar mining areas globally but also provide guidance for ecological management and the rational utilization of water and soil resources in semi-arid coal mining areas."}}

Using a WHO-WHAT-WHEN-HOW analytical framework, we identify key stakeholders, governance elements, implementation stages, and mechanisms for AI procurement governance in customs operations. Findings reveal significant gaps in customs-specific AI procurement frameworks, limited stakeholder coordination mechanisms, and insufficient adaptation of international best practices to developing country contexts.

Drawing on the framework of Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory, we incorporate loss aversion into the players' perceived payoffs. We demonstrate that this distortion can alter dominant strategies and lead to an equilibrium that differs from that predicted by traditional game theory. Using a revised matrix of subjective payoffs, we analyze the conditions under which cooperation becomes a more rational strategy in the presence of loss aversion. Our model suggests that seemingly irrational behaviors can encourage more cooperative and stable outcomes, with significant implications for the analysis of economic and social interactions. The integration of bounded rationality into strategic games not only provides a more realistic representation of human decision-making, but also offers new insights for fostering cooperative behavior in conflictual settings."}}

Different from prior finding that firms in developed countries increase R&amp;D investments in response to environmental taxes, we do not find more investment in green technologies by highly polluting Chinese firms or firms from provinces with higher environmental tax rates after the implementation of China's Environmental Protection Tax Law. Instead, these firms increase their income tax avoidance to offset the additional costs caused by the Environmental Protection Tax. This increase in tax avoidance is more pronounced for firms with greater financial constraints, firms in provinces with higher environmental tax rates and greater emphasis on environmental protection. While the environmental tax, on average, improves polluting firms' environmental performance, this effect is muted for firms that increase their income tax avoidance. Overall, our findings suggest that the role of environmental taxation in promoting environmental sustainability is undermined by Chinese firms' income tax avoidance. Our study provides important policymaking implications by identifying an unintended consequence of environmental taxation in emerging markets and showing how different taxes interact with each other."}}

From this settlement, it required Barnard to establish new oversight mechanisms like an independent antisemitism review board, restrict certain forms of student protest activity, and consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism (a non-legally binding working definition that aims to provide clarity and guidance on identifying antisemitism). According to a joint statement by Barnard and the lawyers for two Jewish advocacy groups, Students Against Antisemitism and StandWithUs Center for Legal Justice, mandatory reforms such as staff training, transparent incident reporting, and enforcement of a strict zero-tolerance antisemitism policy are needed. Additionally, Barnard will also appoint a new Title Vl coordinator to investigate discrimination complaints and produce annual reports on antisemitism. As antisemitism is resurfacing among colleges across the nation, colleges must act now or risk legal consequences. Title Vl Enforcement and Federal Pressure Title Vl of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin. In response to increased antisemitism, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and other federal agencies are taking firmer stances. The violation of Title Vl, for instance, can lead to the loss of federal funding, legal action, and reputational damage. What's happening at Barnard is just one of many other investigations in which universities are pressured to revise their anti-discrimination systems, train staff on hate incidents, and ensure that it is carried out consistently and efficiently. Before this, Title VI enforcement wasn't as prevalent-even with complaints from students about the ongoing protests. Taking actual legal action seems to be the step to start seeing a difference in anti-discriminatory practices. Differentiating Between Freedom of Expression and Hate Speech As institutions start to enforce their policies more strictly, questions about the First Amendment will be referred to often, especially in cases of whether or not the activities happening on campus are a form of expression or considered hate speech. According to Len Saxe, the Klutznick Professor of Contemporary Jewish Studies and director of Brandeis' Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies, more than 25% of Jewish students across 50 different private and public universities in America expressed feelings of hostility after the 2014 Gaza conflict, and continuing now after the October 7 conflict as well. The most common form of expression from college students was made through vocal protests."}}

The analysis delves into how Shell's environmental and social policies-though commendable on paper-fall short in practice, contributing to long-term ecological damage and social disruption in the communities where they operate. The essay further examines the Nigerian government's response through its Environmental Impact Assessment Act (EIAA), highlighting issues around compliance, enforcement, and legal adequacy. By drawing from legal cases, academic literature, and policy reviews, this work reflects on the tension between economic development and environmental justice. It argues that without stronger oversight and more robust legal reform, profit-driven corporate activity will continue to outweigh the rights and wellbeing of local populations."}}

Pomerantz's \"Foreign Aid: Policy and Practice,\" the study explores competing perspectives on whether aid endorses sustainable development, especially for underdeveloped nations. Using correlation analysis, the study finds an inverse correlation between domestic industrial output and total Chinese aid, suggesting that aid has not stimulated domestic production. Total Chinese aid also has a positive relationship with unemployment in Balochistan, home to one of the most significant projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, indicating that extensive infrastructure development through Chinese aid has not fulfilled its promises to create employment. Policy analysis has shown that these effects are forcefully concurred by Pakistan in order to stay afloat. This is evident in the Special Economic Zones Act of 2012, tax exemptions outlined in finance acts, and the realignment of Pakistan's foreign policy. These policies have directly facilitated China's Belt and Road Initiative. As long as China remains a major benefactor, Pakistan's institutional and economic reforms will continue to prioritise the interests of China."}}

This study examines trade policies, GDP, FDI, proximity, and regional agreements to assess trade flows and economic integration. This study uses a gravity model with panel data regression (1999-2023) to examine regional trade flows. The gravity model estimates the impact of economic size and distance on trade volumes, whereas panel data regression evaluates the relationship between trade policies and economic integration. Data include trade statistics from secondary sources. The finding reveals that economic integration improves trade volume through aligned policies and economic interdependencies. The gravity model highlights that economic size and proximity sustain trade flows, whereas FDI shows a positive correlation, indicating the potential for more profound integration; the trade potential model examines how trade policies and economic size affect intra-regional commerce, a topic rarely studied in the literature. This study calculates trade potential, offering insights for policymakers to improve trade efficiency. Unlike past research that has isolated ASEAN, China, and India, this study provides a comprehensive regional perspective. However, these limitations exclude exchange rates, technology, language, tariffs, and post-2023 applicability. </span></p>"}}

The flexibility of the MSDSP model captures the possibility of zero coefficients (sparsity), constant coefficient (dynamic shrinkage), as well as sudden and gradual parameter movements (structural change) in the time-varying parameter model setting. We also apply MSDSP in the context of Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS) (McAlinn and West, 2019), where dynamic combination schemes exploit the information from the alternative economic models.

The total reconstruction and recovery needs are at USD 486 billion (World Bank, 2024) which makes up more than 2.5 times Ukraine’s 2023 GDP (Nivievskyi et al, 2024). This comes on top of the expenditures on national defense that amounted to 65% of total Ukraine’s budget expenditures ballooned the fiscal deficit to 20.6% of GDP or USD4 billion per month (KSE, 2024). &nbsp;</span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Ukraine has been in the process of decentralization reform since 2015. On top of the administrative amalgamation of territorial units, this reform empowered local authorities with more decision power in terms of managing the taxes and expenditures. On the other hand, local governments face more responsibilities and pressure to mobilize their local fiscal resources needed to cope with the current and future challenges. Hence, the focus on the efficient usage of local resources to maximize local fiscal revenues and its regular monitoring is difficult to underestimate these days for Ukraine (IMF, 2022).&nbsp; In this paper we make a first ever attempt to benchmark tax potential and efforts of local governments in Ukraine that would allow a regular and continued monitoring and be useful for the purposes of informed decision making. This could be an alternative approach to the one that is used by the Government of Ukraine that is essentially a weighted aggregation of the scores on a selection of communities’ variables without a well-grounded methodological foundation. Moreover, there is an alternative, but not official approach that was developed by an expert group in the government that is also essentially an aggregation of the individual scores on a selection of communities’ variables (Kazuik, 2023a). Important, though, is that these two methods produce different results and rankings (Kazuik, 2023b).So such an inconsistency only reinforce one of the key messages of the OECD (2022) that calls for a more robust performance measurement framework and instruments that would support hromadas’ post-war recovery and development.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is also worth noting that most of the empirical studies on this topic focus on a cross-country analysis of tax effort and potential, lacking evidence at the level of local communities – regions, districts and/or municipalities (see Cyan et al. 2013, Fenochietto and Pessino 2013, Minh Le et al. 2013, Langford and Ohlenburg 2016, Mawejje and Sebudde 2019). Our paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on local level within a particular country of interest.</span></p>\n<div>\n <div>\n </div>\n</div>"}}

This study employs an augmented gravity model to examine the determinants of interprovincial migration in Mongolia, utilizing balanced panel data spanning the period from 2000 to 2024. The model incorporates a multidimensional set of economic, spatial, social, and environmental variables and applies robust estimation techniques, including Estimated Generalized Least Squares (EGLS) and Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), to account for heteroskedasticity and cross-equation error correlations. Empirical results confirm that provinces with higher GDP per capita, elevated wage levels, and better access to healthcare attract significantly more immigrants. In contrast, greater distance from the capital and limited employment opportunities function as migration deterrents. Residual-based diagnostics further reveal spatial heterogeneity, indicating that certain provinces, including Khentii, consistently exceed predicted inflow levels, suggesting the influence of unmeasured factors such as regional identity, perceived safety, or cultural embeddedness. Conversely, provinces like Sukhbaatar exhibit persistent negative residuals, reflecting structural barriers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to essential services. A comparative assessment of the eastern provinces reinforces these findings, highlighting pronounced differences in regional migration appeal and underscoring the importance of localized development strategies. The study emphasizes that national migration policies must move beyond economic incentives, also to consider quality-of-life factors, ecological resilience, and social infrastructure gaps. While the analysis provides meaningful insights for spatial policy and regional development, it is limited by its reliance on aggregate data and the lack of household-level behavioral information. Future research should adopt mixed-methods approaches, integrating micro-level surveys and spatial econometric techniques to provide a more comprehensive model of migration decisions in transition economies. This study contributes to the migration literature by offering empirically grounded and policy-relevant evidence tailored to the unique context of a sparsely populated developing country."}}

It assumes that prices, wages and interest rates are flexible, allowing markets to adjust naturally. The aim of the project is to understand how national income, inflation, trade and unemployment reach equilibrium without government involvement. The long-run perspective helps highlight the role of supply-side factors and market-driven stability. It includes analysis of income generation through the production function, role of money in causing inflation, foreign trade balance in an open economy and how economy is corrected through wage flexibility. Key concepts like the quantity Theory of Money and the natural rate of unemployment are applied. Classical models, flow diagrams and labour market's graphs are used to support the concepts. The classical approach shows that the economy is capable of correcting itself over time. This model remains relevant in policy discussions on inflation targeting and fiscal restraint. It provides a strong foundation for long policy thinking focused on inflation control and productivity growth."}}

This paper investigates how ASEAN countries have approached AI policymaking amid rising automation and trade integration pressures—and whether these strategies have delivered tangible economic benefits. While technological maturity, as proxied by ICT readiness, is a strong predictor of AI policy adoption, our regression results show that AI policy strength does not have a statistically significant causal impact on either trade competitiveness (measured via Revealed Comparative Advantage in ICT sectors) or structural automation integration (measured via Sensitivity_IO). This disconnect points to a broader insight: many AI strategies in ASEAN remain symbolic, lacking integration into national production systems. Our country-level analysis, however, reveals important exceptions. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and to some extent Vietnam that crafted early, sectorally-aligned, and well-structured AI policies show more promising linkages between AI governance and economic transformation. In contrast, other nations have adopted generic or globally modeled policies without tailoring them to domestic industrial or labor market contexts—limiting their impact. Using panel data from 10 ASEAN countries (2015–2024), this paper combines two approaches: (1) a structured review of national AI policies and their alignment with economic goals, and (2) a data-centric analysis using a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) Instrumental Variable model to assess the impact of AI policy strength on trade and automation indicators. The findings suggest that policy presence alone is insufficient—AI governance must be embedded within sector-specific strategies, institutional ecosystems, and productivity agendas. Our results have clear implications for policymakers. First, technological maturity enables policy adoption but does not guarantee impact. Second, context-sensitive, well-implemented AI policies—like those of Singapore—can enhance national competitiveness when aligned with economic priorities. Third, ASEAN must move beyond high-level strategies toward implementation mechanisms that integrate AI into industrial ecosystems and labor force development. As AI reshapes industries, the region’s success will depend not just on adoption, but on strategic alignment, sectoral embedding, and institutional capacity."}}

The Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) play a pivotal role in India's rural healthcare delivery, delivering maternal and child healthcare, immunisation, and prevention of diseases. Although they play a critical role, they are defined as 'volunteers' perpetuating economic disparities based upon gender and excluded from formal employment privileges like fixed pay, pensions, and social security. This paper critically analyses their tenuous legal position under Indian labour laws and constitutional provisions, placing their work in the wider care and gig economies. Using International human rights instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the paper shows how India's handling of ASHAs negates core labour rights. The article also contrasts India's model with international best practices, examining structured community health worker (CHW) programs in Brazil, South Africa, Ethiopia, Rwanda, China, and Russia. In contrast to ASHAs, CHWs in these nations are formally trained, paid a fixed salary, and provided social security, ensuring financial security and professional status. India's system based on incentives keeps ASHAs financially vulnerable and open to exploitation, further worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic when they were assigned frontline work without proper compensation or protection. By suggesting harmonisation of India's policies with global standards and acknowledging ASHAs as a part of the public health infrastructure, the government can facilitate equity, dignity, and sustainability of healthcare delivery. Enforcing ASHAs' rights will not only strengthen the workers but also the overall efficacy of India's public health system. While acknowledging, defining, and sufficiently paying CHWs is not all about social justice, it's an inevitable initiative to accomplish the universal health cover."}}

This study examines the potential environmental impact of dietary choices and the factors influencing attitudes towards dietary change. Specifically, we (i) compare the carbon emissions of plant-based versus less plant-based diets, (ii) assess whether current consumption patterns generate higher emissions than both \"reduced\" (lower intake of animal products) and \"compensated\" (lower intake of animal products offset by increased non-animal food consumption) scenarios, and (iii) analyze individual predictors of both the likelihood (extensive margin) and extent (intensive margin) of dietary change. Using survey data from a representative UK sample (N = 300), we find that plant-based diets consistently exhibit lower environmental impact. Reducing animal product consumption significantly lowers emissions, which is not fully offset by compensating choices. Correlational analysis identifies personal norms, ethnicity, income, religion, moral values related to \"harm,\" and family composition as significant predictors of attitudes towards dietary change. Personal norms also account for the extent of dietary shifts. Our findings suggest that policy interventions can promote direct reductions in animal product consumption allowing for compensatory dietary behaviors, while leveraging personal norms as a key driver of change."}}

It shows that while governance and fragility indicators help identify the conditions that enable TBML, mirror trade data can strongly indicate related transactions. The impact of abrupt changes in government regimes on governance and fragility indicators are assessed to underscore how such conditions facilitate TBML. The paper uses mirror trade data to show large-scale financing gaps as well as export smuggling. While direct military rule led to a further deterioration in governance, greater civilian participation in the running of government improved conditions, underscoring the importance of such oversight in the successful control of TBML. Mirror trade data show large under-reporting of Myanmar's imports. Given past sources of external credit and Myanmar's limited capacity to attract additional financing, recorded flows are unlikely to have closed the large financing gaps. Instead, prima facie evidence points to the financing of unrecorded imports using illicit funds generated through the smuggling of Myanmar's natural resources across porous borders. The article makes an important contribution to the literature on money laundering by showing that weak governance and increasing state fragility can create the ecosystem necessary to sustain TBML. Furthermore, mirror trade data reveal large import financing gaps and suggest widespread export smuggling which together provide a prima facie evidence of TBML."}}

The study advances current literature by integrating cognitive-behavioral theory with technology acceptance frameworks, moving beyond utilitarian models like TAM.

This paper proposes an optimal dispatch strategy for sector-coupled power–heat–gas integrated energy systems, including renewable energy that considers emission allowance allocation schemes to evaluate the impacts of carbon pricing, economic performance, and environmental sustainability. A linearized integrated energy system model is developed to system marginal price settlements under different allowance allocation schemes, enabling assessment of carbon and cost trade-offs under various policy and market scenarios. System performance is evaluated through sensitivity analyses of sector coupling device efficiency, energy prices, and carbon prices. The results show that excessive improvements in certain efficiency parameters, particularly thermal efficiency in CHP units, can lead to counterproductive outcomes by raising both indirect emissions and operating costs. Through case studies under diverse external scenarios, the study provides practical recommendations for system operators, investors, and policymakers to support affordable and low-carbon energy transitions. The findings underscore the importance of well-designed emission allocation policies and cost-effective investment strategies in achieving climate and energy goals."}}

A so-far little explored issue is whether and how the deepness of firms, meaning the number of hierarchical levels, affects employment segregation in the labor market. We show how the Duncan index, a widely used measure of segregation, changes as firm organizations become deeper, first in a simplified flow model of the labor market, and then when transition probabilities are endogenized in a simulation model with internal promotions and external worker mobility across firms in a frictional environment. Our results suggest that a new hierarchical level can reduce segregation and serve as a stepping stone for disadvantaged workers in the \"bottleneck\" part of the career ladder. Yet, a new level can turn into a stumbling block for disadvantaged workers increasing segregation, if it is introduced in parts of the career ladder preceding the \"bottleneck\"."}}

We implemented a data-driven, human-in-the-loop optimization framework based on Bayesian optimization (BO) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to systematically refine shark egg yolk-free diets. Across eight sequential feeding trials, the ingredient ratios of seven key components were iteratively adjusted, guided by empirical expert insight. Survival rate and total length (TL) were measured from 6 to 100 days post-hatch (dph). Multi-objective optimization targeted simultaneous improvement in survival and growth during the early (6-40 dph) and late (41-80 dph) periods. The optimized diet formulations achieved survival rates up to 74.9% versus 30.7% in controls and mean TL of 40.1 mm versus 35.2 mm (p < 0.05) at 100 dph. These results were consistently reproduced in independent validation trials. Mechanistic modeling via Random Forest and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that stage‑specific balancing of yeast extract-derived nutrients and other macronutrient components were critical drivers of improved survival and growth. To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of BO to larval feed optimization in Japanese eel. Our framework integrates probabilistic modeling with expert input to reduce experimental burden and accelerate development of superior larval diet formulations. This approach offers a practical, broadly applicable template for feed innovation across aquaculture species."}}

This study examines the impact of renewable electricity (RE) and non-renewable electricity (N-RE) generation on wholesale day-ahead electricity prices in India. Advanced econometric methods—Cross Quantilogram (CQ), Granger Quantile Causality (GCQ), and multivariate Quantile on Quantile Regression (mQQR)—are employed to capture cross-quantile dependencies and address the unique dynamics of electricity markets and the intermittency of RE generation. The results reveal the absence of a Merit Order Effect of RE generation in India, a finding that diverges from trends observed in advanced economies. RE generation exerts a positive but inelastic impact on higher electricity price quantiles, while N-RE generation similarly raises prices, with effects transitioning from elastic to inelastic as generation levels increase. These findings highlight the challenges in balancing affordability under SDG-7, with RE contributing to upward price pressures at higher quantiles. The study recommends introducing a carbon tax on N-RE generation, which could help narrow the current price gaps between electricity from RE and N-RE sources, thereby promoting greater adoption of RE in line with SDG-13. Additionally, the study calls for a re-evaluation of the incentives currently provided to the RE sector, as existing policies fail to effectively reduce electricity prices. These findings offer critical insights for policymakers navigating the affordability-sustainability nexus in India&apos;s energy transition."}}

In this research, the goal is to develop an efficient forecasting hybrid model framework for electricity consumption for multiple horizons with univariate dataset. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach which is hybrid decomposition of time series data into linear and nonlinear subseries utilizing Regression spline method and smoothing spline method respectively. Afterwards, this subseries has been modelled utilizing the appropriate machine learning model with least root mean square error (ML) (linear part) and least square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) (nonlinear part) model. In the end, this proposed hybrid model ML-LSSVM has been used for prediction and results obtained from both methods has been combined for predicted values for univariate data. The proposed model ML-LSSVM has been given the least root mean square error (RMSE) values in short-term forecasting (STF), medium- term forecasting (MTF) and long-term forecasting (LTF) horizons for univariate data.

The UK has amongst the most inefficient building stock in Europe and is largely reliant on natural gas-fired boilers to provide heating. Given its cold northern climate, heating accounts for the majority of building energy use and associated GHG emissions. Deep retrofitting—combined with a widescale shift to efficient electric heat pumps—is therefore essential for achieving the UK’s Net Zero 2050 target, making it an ideal case study.Discussions around this transition often focus narrowly on upfront capital investment costs, overlooking potential broader economic benefits. Thus, a better understanding of the potential socio-macroeconomic impacts of improved energy efficiency from decarbonising buildings could help reframe the debate, address energy rebound effects and accelerate the decarbonisation of the buildings sector.This paper uses the novel MARCO-UK model, which integrates final-to-useful energy efficiency gains into an energy-economy modelling framework to analyse a sequential set of scenarios including deep building retrofit,  heat pumps deployment and demand-side measures. Results show that the central Transform 2a scenario leads to a £1,125bn of GDP gain by 2050, with a 2.3 return ratio on £491Bn investment.

Its macroeconomic dynamics also highlight the need for accompanying social and economic policy to ensure a just and inclusive transition."}}

Utilizing data from A-share listed companies in China, we employed ChatGPT to perform a semantic analysis of annual reports, quantifying the extent of AI adoption by firms. Under this measurement, we find that AI adoption significantly decreases the standard deviation of stock returns or fortifies corporate resilience. Mechanism analysis reveals that the principal channels through which AI enhances resilience include improved information disclosure quality, reduced transaction costs, and optimized supply chain efficiency. Further heterogeneity analysis shows that the resilience-enhancing effects of AI are particularly pronounced in firms operating within highly competitive industries, those experiencing significant financing constraints, and those with dispersed ownership structures. Moreover, robust cybersecurity governance markedly amplifies the positive impact of AI on corporate resilience, underscoring the synergistic interplay between these factors. This study contributes to the micro-level theoretical understanding of how AI supports stable corporate operations and offers practical implications for firms aiming to mitigate risks through AI adoption."}}

This problem is formulated as a two-stage robust optimization model, with the objective of minimizing total costs while ensuring high service levels for shippers. The extended risk-bounded model makes decisions more aligned with business practice. Based on the problem characteristics, the model is decomposed into a master problem and a subproblem, and an enhanced column-and-constraint generation (EC&CG) algorithm is developed to efficiently solve this model. The applicability of the model and the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified through computational experiments. Sensitivity analysis reveals the impact of factors such as service level, uncertainty parameters, penalty cost, and sailing speed on total cost. The obtained solution exhibits strong performance in both cost management and service level consistency, offering actionable insights and reliable decision support for ship fleet planning in uncertain environments."}}

Employing operational data from Turkish Airlines’ hub-and-spoke network, we demonstrate that rescheduling a representative subset of flights—based on a representative summer schedule without disclosing proprietary timeframes—yields up to 57% revenue improvement compared to the existing schedule. The proposed integer programming framework utilizes passenger choice indices and transfer demand capture rates, enabling strategic schedule redesign.

This study examines how CEO personality traits, specifically extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, influence CVC head turnover, and investigates the moderating role of a CEO’s career background on these relationships. Using panel data from S&P 500 firms between 2000 and 2020, we employ linguistic analysis tools to measure CEO personality traits, revealing that openness and extraversion in CEOs have distinct effects on turnover depending on their career trajectory. Our findings indicate that an external career background enhances the impact of high openness and reduces the positive effect of extraverted CEOs on CVC head turnover. Further the external career progression of the CEO moderates the CVC head turnover effects of CEOs high agreeableness and conscientiousness. A post hoc analysis reveals that CEO personality traits, particularly openness and conscientiousness, also influence the career paths of CVC heads, determining whether they remain within the parent firm or pursue external (fund) opportunities. This study contributes to HR literature by linking leadership personality traits to talent retention and extends innovation literature by providing insights into turnover in critical innovation roles like CVC heads. Additionally, it advances CVC literature by emphasizing the importance of CEO-CVC head collaboration, demonstrating how turnover in these roles can disrupt strategic initiatives and hinder organizational growth. We offer managerial insights into how organizations can better retain CVC heads through alignment between CEO traits and CVC head roles, ultimately supporting long-term innovation strategies."}}

As a major European economy, France stands at a critical moment in balancing its reliance on nuclear power with the acceleration of renewable energy adoption and fostering green industrial innovation. This is relevant as the country faces increasing pressure to align with the EU's 2050 carbon-neutrality goals while addressing domestic challenges, including fiscal constraints. This study employs a descriptive methodology based on a comparative analysis of indicators. By analysing indicators such as R&amp;D spending, patenting trends, renewable energy costs, and green export shares, the paper assesses France's green goods export competitiveness, industrial strengths, energy transition inputs, and transition risks relative to other G7 nations, China, and Spain. The findings reveal that while France benefits from strong nuclear infrastructure and high Green Complexity Potential, its share in global green exports has declined-from 4.7% in 2000 to 2.5% in 2022. Furthermore, lagging renewable energy deployment, limited fiscal support, and gaps in green innovation suggest that France risks falling behind some European counterparts, such as Germany or Italy, in achieving leadership in the green transition. However, opportunities exist in high-complexity sectors such as hydrogen, environmental monitoring, and carbon capture technologies, where France's existing capabilities can drive competitiveness and export growth. Its participation in a single European green good export market is a key strategy to strengthen a competitive transition in France and Europe more widely."}}

We find that advisors in high-crime areas are significantly more likely to commit misconduct, with stronger effects among repeat offenders, male, highly licensed, and younger advisors. This relationship is intensified in regions with high corruption and low competition but weakens in areas with greater financial literacy and religious participation. Exploiting the 2010 Dodd-Frank Whistleblower Provision as a quasi-natural experiment, we show that regulatory oversight mitigates the crime-misconduct link. Additional evidence suggests that misbehaving advisors tend to relocate to higher-crime counties post-infraction, highlighting the importance of regional context in shaping advisor behavior. Our findings offer new insights into how community-level disorder influences ethical conduct in finance."}}

This study analyzes Türkiye's post-COVID financial landscape as a critical case through which to examine state strategies aimed at resisting the systemic adoption of cryptocurrencies. Despite escalating grassroots demand for digital assets-driven by Lira depreciation, inflationary pressures, and declining institutional trust-the Turkish government has leveraged a combination of regulatory, monetary, and legal instruments to preserve the Lira's role as the exclusive legal tender.<br><br>Utilizing theories of monetary sovereignty and financial statecraft, alongside recent literature on crypto regulation in emerging markets and empirical insights from IMF and BIS analyses on FX interventions, this paper formulates a structured set of research questions and hypotheses to interrogate the relationship between cryptocurrency adoption, FX volatility, and institutional resistance. Methodologically, the study employs ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with Newey-West corrections, lagged models, and event studies centered on Türkiye’s key regulatory milestones (2021–2024) to capture causal dynamics and policy feedback loops.<br><br>Findings demonstrate a robust correlation between increased BTC/TRY volumes and TRY/USD volatility, underscoring the self-reinforcing nature of speculative feedback loops in fragile monetary environments. The evidence shows that heightened crypto adoption amplifies FX volatility through TRY Volatility Feedback Effects (TFF), particularly during geopolitical crises such as the June 2025 Middle East conflict, where BTC’s decline and USD’s appreciation reaffirmed the persistence of traditional safe-haven behaviors. Türkiye’s institutional response intensified proportionally through bans on crypto payments, licensing regimes, enhanced FX market interventions, and rhetorical strategies aimed at reaffirming sovereign monetary control.<br><br>Although cryptocurrencies function as informal hedging mechanisms for households, this study confirms they cannot sustainably displace fiat currencies&nbsp;where sovereign defenses remain actively enforced. Instead, they exacerbate volatility, prompting reactive state interventions. This research contributes to broader debates on financial sovereignty in emerging markets by offering Türkiye as a paradigmatic example of how states leverage legal, monetary, and infrastructural tools to constrain decentralized finance amid persistent macroeconomic vulnerabilities.<br><br>Moreover, the study introduces ValueMesh™, a novel sovereign-aligned alternative developed within Türkiye’s emerging financial ecosystem through the DevPay Türkiye platform. ValueMesh bridges the gap between public demand for high-yield, participatory finance and state imperatives of monetary sovereignty by offering regulated, project-specific micro-equity participation without reliance on blockchain-based assets. This innovation demonstrates that the psychological appeal of crypto speculation can be redirected into legally sanctioned, productive, and sovereign-controlled fintech architectures. Ultimately, Türkiye’s experience illustrates that the future of financial innovation in fragile economies lies not in decentralized disruption but in carefully engineered, state-backed digital ecosystems that integrate speculative incentives within sovereign frameworks. This positions Türkiye’s post-COVID monetary strategy as a critical reference point for policymakers, scholars, and industry leaders examining the evolving interplay between financial sovereignty, decentralized finance, and geopolitical risk.&nbsp;"}}

Yet, when broken to transport and logistics digital processes tend to be uneven, fragmented, and generally too declarative. Conservative way of thinking of the majority of market participants also hampers such transformation, which is mostly evident in global trade in hydrocarbons. In its turn, juridical unsettledness both globally and nationally of electronic turnover of transport documents at large and electronic Bill of Lading (B/L) in particular both globally and nationally also undermines the upcoming perspectives. Thus, the paper believes that it is too early to speak about a well-structured system of electronic document turnover (incl.

Besides, banks’ joining the process is quite disputable despite the fact there is already the electronic version (eUCP) of ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600). In this essence, Bolero, yet with some clauses, turns out to be the most leading platforms servicing e-B/Ls.</span></p>\n<p><span>To sum it up, given the lack of solid system of electronic turnover of transport documents both in organizational and juridical terms a good example of existing practices could be derived from the telex-release technology used in liner shipping of containers and containing some traits of e-B/L ascendancies.

Through real-world examples such as the Flint water crisis in the United States, the murder of environmental activist Berta Cáceres in Honduras, and the devastating oil pollution in Nigeria's Niger Delta, the paper demonstrates that the denial of environmental rights is not a distant or occasional problem, but a persistent injustice with human costs.&nbsp;\n<div>\n <p>By unpacking key concepts like “environmental rights” and “vulnerable persons,” this essay moves beyond theoretical definitions to consider the lived realities of affected communities.

In concluding, the paper makes a case for a human rights-based approach to environmental protection—one that treats access to a clean and safe environment not as a privilege, but as a fundamental right. It argues that achieving environmental justice will require not only international legal reform but also inclusive participation, education, and a collective commitment to protect those most at risk.</p>\n</div>"}}

In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have shown promise in significant wave height (SWH) forecasting for specific locations or regions. However, single DL models often lack robustness when faced with diverse data and struggle to capture complex nonlinear relationships. In contrast, multi-model ensemble forecasting, which combines the outputs of various models, offers a more robust solution by leveraging the strengths of different DL methods across datasets. Despite its potential, mean ensemble forecasting suffers from the drawback of assigning equal weights to all models, which often fails to fully exploit individual model strengths and may result in performance that is inferior to that of the best single model. Moreover, existing ensemble strategies often overlook the challenge of extending single-point predictions to spatial fields. To address these limitations, this study proposes an adaptive weighted ensemble methodology for global SWH forecasting based on ERA5 reanalysis data. An adaptive weighting algorithm, based on softmax-constrained Bayesian optimization, is employed to assign distinct weights to each model under different sea-state conditions, thereby capturing both spatial variability and model-specific strengths. The ensemble comprises six neural networks as base learners: UNet, Att-UNet, Nested-UNet, ModSegNet, Swin-UNet, and Mamba-UNet. All of these models are based on autoencoder frameworks, which are effective in capturing spatial features and modeling the nonlinear, dynamic patterns inherent in SWH forecasting. In extreme wave height forecasting experiments, the proposed ensemble significantly reduces cumulative errors and improves global prediction accuracy, with relative improvements of 10.91% and 6.96% over the mean ensemble and the best-performing base model (ModSegNet), respectively. This work may have implications for the development of ocean forecasting products aimed at enhancing risk analysis and safety decision-making in response to changing marine conditions."}}

This suggests the value of defining the relationship between the BoE's objectives, and providing the rationale for additional objectives. Clearer objectives should result in better accountability. Further research should inform potential trade-off of objectives combinations, and their effect on socioeconomic variables."}}

This study rethinks rice straw as a resource for bioenergy innovation and examines its potential to enhance sustainable livelihoods in rice-producing communities in the Philippines. Using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework as an analytical lens, this research explores the allocation of key resources, stakeholder perceptions of challenges and opportunities, and priorities within the rice value chain. A gamified participatory approach was employed to engage stakeholders in structured decision-making. Mixed methods were used to analyse the data. Friedman Test and Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance assessed rankings and consensus on priority resources, challenges, and opportunities in rice production, while thematic analysis provided qualitative insights. Findings reveal climate change as a compounding challenge that disrupts planting cycles and exacerbates livelihood vulnerability. Financial and natural capital emerged as the most crucial factors influencing decision-making. Structural barriers constrain farmer agency, such as debt dependency, limited post-harvest access, and weak market linkages. Social capital, while underutilised, holds transformative potential for collective action and equitable value distribution. The results of this study underscore the need for targeted interventions, including governance frameworks that support food production, bioenergy investment, farmer capacity-building initiatives, and multi-stakeholder partnerships to integrate bioenergy solutions into existing agricultural systems."}}

The effect is more pronounced (1) for contractors whose majority of awarded contracts are either cost-plus or competitive, where audit quality plays a more important role; and (2) for contractors whose switch to Big 4 auditors is not due to auditor resignations, which could compromise audit quality. Our findings hold after controlling for firm characteristics that potentially trigger an auditor switch and after conducting a batch of robustness tests. Collectively, the results suggest that the \"Big 4 effect\" exists in the U.S. government procurement market, a phenomenon undocumented in the literature."}}

Under New Zealand's current law copyright law Gen AI images created through TTI can be protected as computer-generated works, provided they are original. For Gen AI images that are protected, the duration of copyright is currently 50 years and the scope of protection depends on the level of originality. The higher the originality, the wider the protection. Users creating GenAI images through TTI will be the first owners of the copyright in the image and as the works are computer-generated the users will not obtain moral rights in the Gen AI image. Thus, GenAI images are not afforded the same level of protection as more traditionally created works. Due to the difference in treatment of GenAI images compared with traditional works, Gen AI images should be clearly identified, with the copyright owner unable to sue for copyright infringement in the absence of such identification."}}

We find that sanctions inflict relatively small costs on average: sanctioning 1% of GDP worth of imports or exports leads to approximately 0.3 percentage points of lost GDP over a 5-year period and a 0.1 percentage point increase in unemployment. However, we show that sanctions are far more costly for countries whose trade is highly concentrated, and for countries that rely heavily on exporting primary commodities. Low income and developing countries appear most vulnerable to trade sanctions, while high income financial centers and some EU countries are among the most exposed to financial sanctions."}}

This paradigm shift creates a doctrinal crisis for antitrust law.

Consequently, competition in these markets is no longer a natural state to be protected, but an engineered outcome that must be legally mandated. To engineer pro-competitive outcomes, this Article proposes a new governance framework centered on a legally enforceable \"Duty to Disrupt\" for consumer-facing buyer agents. This duty is operationalized through a multi-layered framework combining (1) structural rules, such as a \"Glass-Steagall for AI,\" to prevent conflicts of interest; (2) a proactive oversight regime of mandatory algorithmic auditing; and (3) reformed evidentiary standards that shift the burden of proof. This framework provides a viable path to preserving competition by shifting the focus of antitrust from policing human conspiracy to mandating pro-competitive agent design."}}

What are the regulatory answers to these deceptive deepfakes? As this paper will show, there is no single approach and answer to the topic. Currently, the problem is tackled by existing, albeit non-specific regulations, (e.g. privacy, intellectual property, image rights), and by newly adopted regulations focusing on a specific aspect (deepfakes aimed at manipulating elections or non-consensual pornographic materials). To present an overview of these regulations, the paper compares the approaches of the USA and the EU, including examples of national legislation. Summarizing the findings, the paper shows the laws need to regulate the ecosystem of actors involved in these deceptive contents (from the creators to the distributors and possibly the viewers in case of deepfake child pornography). Beyond the ecosystem, solutions should also focus on individuals who are victims of these deepfakes created without their consent and knowledge. A different approach might be well needed to ensure they can defend their digital self and prevent malicious AI-altered reproductions and use of themselves."}}

Our results show that regulatory effectiveness is nonlinear and depends on market structure, timing, and firms&apos; perceptions.

Our findings reveal that financial market indicators, notably volatility and credit spreads, exert the strongest influence on fund flows, whereas climate and ESG uncertainties play a more limited role. In periods of heightened uncertainty, investors reallocate capital toward money market funds, consistent with flight-to-safety behavior. The analysis reveals differentiated behavioral responses depending on fund size, although climate and sustainability risks exert only a limited influence on overall fund dynamics.

Consequently, the model predicts that stock replacing typically happens after a good performance of the existing stock, providing a dual learning perspective on the disposition effect.

Empirically, we evaluate the predictive performance of the proposed model in comparison with a conventional benchmark. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed model produces density forecasts more closely aligned with the true distribution of stock prices, significantly enhancing forecast accuracy.

Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed’s communication during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further document that communicating about UMP has become the “new normal” for the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman’s speeches since the Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in communication strategy following periods of economic distress.

Considering the gap between law and development theory and practice, this paper bridges academic knowledge in unpacking ethical and governance issues in the intellectual property industry, healthcare law and emerging technologies. Unpacking these issues is important in the law and development context as ethical issues that arise from emerging technologies using AI systems and the responses from policymakers in governing their developments create long-term implications to individuals and populations. Governance responses often vary according to the local contexts, and are dependent on the unique socio-cultural structures, institutional organisations and legal frameworks."}}

Islamic finance has developed within the constraints of sharia law and has been a growth sector for the GCC. This article will identify the main principles of Islamic finance that contribute to the success of Islamic finance, which can enhance intellectual property protection in the GCC. The main sharia-compliant areas to be considered are musharaka, mudaraba, murabaha, takaful, istisna, ijara, salam and sukuk. The article will outline the founding principles of Islamic finance, the governance of sharia boards, development of Islamic finance in the individual GCC states, different frameworks of sharia-compliant investment products and the impact of intellectual property rights on the varying Islamic finance investment tools. Furthermore, the article will discuss an integrated approach to intellectual property rights which learns les sons from the Islamic finance sector in relation to infrastructure, regulation and sharia compliance. The lessons learnt from Islamic finance will inform the overall framework of recommendations for an Islamic intellectual property model. The use of Islamic finance as a vehicle to promote better intellectual property rights in terms of defining a new intellectual property approach is novel. It is aimed at spearheading further research in this area, and it will form a part of the overall integrated approach proposals to intellectual property protection in the GCC and beyond."}}

We further explore the potential channels and find that a firm's labor power is negatively associated with its earnings management and financial leverage, but positively associated with the value of employee stock options plans and staff wages. In addition, we find that the negative relationship between employee power and audit fees is more profound for firms headquartered in countries with weak corporate governance (i.e., common law countries, non-EU countries, worse governmental effectiveness), and for firms headquartered in countries with strong labor unions."}}

Divided into three main studies the thesis examines the worldwide issues concerning countries from both macroeconomic and microeconomic perspectives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first study examines the empirical link between economic freedom and fertility rates using panel data from developed and developing nations. Our fixed effects instrumental variable (IV) analysis shows global evidence of a negative impact of economic freedom on fertility behaviour. The influence is particularly pronounced in industrialised and high-income nations than in developing countries. Additionally, our instrumental variable quantile regression analysis reveals a more substantial negative effect for countries with a higher fertility rate. Lastly, we show that the negative impact operates through multiple channels, including income level, women's unemployment, and their decision to receive tertiary education.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second study examines the associations between climate change indicators and legal gender disparity for a global group of developed and developing nations. Our results show that temperature shocks have a pervasive detrimental influence on gender equality. We link deviations from average temperatures to decreases in gender equality rights. This set of influences is more prevalent in developing than developed ones. We argue that less advanced stages of economic development, more reliance on agriculture, higher maternal mortality, and lower levels of democracy are potential mechanisms through which climate change affects gender equality. Policies to improve women's rights and adapt to climate change may be necessary to prioritise and provide greater attention to these crucial intermediate channels.</p>\n<p>The third study focuses on the relationship between women's participation in decision-making and emotional intimate partner violence (IPV) using cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) encompassing nearly one million women across 50 developing countries. Our analyses, including OLS, 2SLS, and Bivariate probit, reveal a significant negative impact of women's decision-making on emotional IPV, particularly pronounced in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that increased decision-making authority notably reduces specific forms of emotional abuse, such as humiliation, threats, and insults. The protective effect is strongest among women aged 30-34, with diminishing effects in older age groups. Furthermore, this impact is more substantial in wealthier households, women whose husbands have completed secondary education or higher, and those currently employed. Conversely, the protective effects are less significant in poorer households. Collaborative decision-making across various domains is crucial for reducing emotional violence between partners and fostering equality and mutual respect.</p>\n<p>The aim of the thesis is to comprehend how the elements revealed in each of these three studies intersect and shape broader development outcomes.</p>"}}

However, the funds combine features of private funds and mutual funds in ways that create unique risks for investors.&nbsp; <br><br>In this paper, I explore the rise of these new \"retail private funds\" and the accompanying risks to investors. I study these funds' legal structures and analyze data collected from their public filings. First, I present evidence that the new funds, like private funds, report very low return volatility that understates their risk. However, because the new funds admit less sophisticated investors and provide periodic liquidity at their reported net asset values, the underreported volatility presents greater investor protection concerns than in private funds. Second, I provide suggestive evidence that some products that are restricted to wealthier investors perform better than products sold more broadly. This performance gap raises the possibility that sponsors are channeling products with poor performance to investors with low financial sophistication and little wealth.&nbsp;<br><br>I conclude by discussing legal and policy changes that would give retail investors the tools they need to avoid being taken advantage of as they invest in the new funds. As policymakers continue to consider ways to expand access to private markets, they should grapple with the risks I highlight and plan ways to mitigate them."}}

Since 2010, the bond market's expansion and low interest rates have weakened traditional ties between unrated firms and well-capitalized banks. Better bond market access reduces unrated firms' reliance on well-capitalized banks, while lower-capitalized banks seek higher yields by lending to these firms. These shifts reflects how alternative financing channels, monetary policy and regulatory changes have reshaped lending relationships post-GFC. During the COVID-19 crisis, matching with well-capitalized banks did not improve unrated firms' access to credit. This result indicates that post-GFC capital regulations and stress testing frameworks improved the solvency of low-capital banks, thereby mitigating the impact of disrupted matching during COVID-19."}}

Hence, SAA has mostly been used through an instrumental approach in the industry (e.g. social license to operate). • The most complete definition of SAA comes from Busse &amp; Siebert (2018) and considers social acceptance to be the positive result of a personal or collective acceptability judgment that can also result in non-acceptance of a given project or policy. • Relevant dimensions described for SAA are community acceptance-the most widespread dimension in the literature on natural resource management-socio-political acceptance and market acceptance, and these can be both positively and negatively correlated with each other. Market acceptance differs from the other dimensions in that it is expressed through engagement. • SAA can vary throughout the phases of a project or policy, which can be defined as input (before implementation), throughput (during implementation) and output (after implementation). • Factors influencing SAA are the focus of most publications but are highly contextual, hence establishing a complete list may not be useful. However, general categories of factors can be derived from the literature: o Personal constructs, social constructs, and behavioral factors: it is through perceptions and representations that individuals and communities evaluate projects and policies to form an acceptability judgement (through personal beliefs, opinions, preferences) that will be expressed through attitudes and behaviours. Socio-psychological needs of procedural justice, self-determination, security and recognition might be of high relevance to understand acceptability judgements. o Context: individual, social, cultural, political, economic and environmental factors within multiple scales, levels, spaces and times, all contribute to changing perceptions and&nbsp;attitudes. Governance arrangements are of especially high relevance, with bottom-up arrangements being usually granted higher acceptance.&nbsp;Social and ecological outcomes: defined as the positive or negative, intentional or unintentional change that may be brought about by a project or policy, may they be anticipated, perceived or observed. o Relational factors: core factors of influence for SAA. They include 1) legitimacy and credibility of projects and project promoters; 2) distributive justice, referring to equality or fairness of the distribution of outcomes (costs or benefits) of a given project, and procedural justice, referring to the perceived fairness of decision-making processes where multi-actor engagement is usually perceived as fairer, and 3) individual or community trust in project promoters, which, if established, can override all other factors. • SAA in ecological restoration is highly contextual, raising issues of fair and democratic participation among communities targeted by projects, along with trust and legitimacy."}}

In addition, the generalized method of moment (GMM) was used as the model for the robustness check model. The earning management was measured with distortionary accruals. In contrast, corporate governance was measured with indicators such as the board size, board governance, and remuneration committees, the number of meetings held by the board, the number of stockholder committees, the number of remuneration committees, and the number of audit committees, and checked their effects on the earning management of the listed manufacturing firms in Nigeria. Findings from the result of the ARDL estimation show that corporate governance has important positive effects on the earning management of listed manufacturing firms in Nigeria. Similarly, we also found that corporate governance has significant positive effects on the earning management of listed manufacturing firms in Nigeria based on the results of the GMM robustness checks. Finally, this study found that corporate governance has a significant positive impact on the earnings management of the listed manufacturing firms in Nigeria. Established the study findings, this study advises that authorities should seek to make policies that would boost corporate governance and minimize earning management in Nigeria."}}

This study bridges that gap by investigating the dual impact of investor loss aversion—a key behavioral bias—and key macroeconomic variables on the resilience of the Tunisian stock market. Employing a quantile regression on panel data for firms listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange (BVMT) from 2020 to 2023, we analyze these effects across different states of market efficiency. Our analysis reveals two primary findings. First, loss aversion exerts a significant and pervasively negative influence on market resilience across all market conditions. Second, the impact of macroeconomic factors is state-dependent: inflation's negative effect is concentrated in the most efficient market states, while higher interest rates are positively associated with resilience, but only within these same high-efficiency quantiles. These results underscore the necessity of integrating behavioral finance into models of market stability and demonstrate that the relationship between macroeconomic policy and resilience is highly contextual, thus providing a more granular understanding of its determinants in an emerging economy.\n</div>\n<div>\n Keywords: Resilience, Behavioral Finance, Loss Aversion, Macroeconomic Variables, Quantile Regression, Emerging Markets\n</div>"}}

While it might seem like a ban on foreign investment in farmland is an easy solution to this problem, that is far from true. The first in a planned series of articles looking at threats to farmland, this article argues that farmland-central to America's food supply, natural resources, and international relations-must be treated as critical infrastructure subject to review under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) even if it is not located near a military or other sensitive site. Specifically, \"covered real estate transactions\" should be redefined to include foreign farmland investments meeting strategic criteria such as that already existing with USDA reporting regulations and various state reporting laws."}}

Display Exploring Court Performance and Developing its Scale Academic Articles Authors Dinesh Kumar Ram Manohar Singh Abstract Courts are an important part of the judiciary. To reduce the pendency of cases, measuring and improving court performance is important. With the objectives of exploring court performance and developing its scale, we conducted two interlocking studies. In study 1, we explored it conceptually. We identified the indicators of court performance through in-depth interviews of legal professionals and clients from the district courts of the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Uttarakhand (UK) (n = 51). Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Based on interviews, we generated items and refined them by using a pilot study (n = 105). After that, in Study 2, we surveyed court stakeholders to assess measurement dimensionality and reliability (n = 517). The scale’s dimensionality was tested using exploratory factor analysis and reliability was tested using Cronbach’s alpha scores. The scale indicated three dimensions: quality of judicial activity, access to justice, and public trust, and excellent internal consistency reliability (α = .959). This scale can be used to measure court performance by taking responses from legal professionals."}}

Using data from the 2013-2019 French Labor Force Survey (N = 122,033), we fnd that people with disabilities are more likely to work part-time across occupations, citing health reasons or the lack of full-time work opportunities. These higher rates of part-time work contribute to disabilityrelated earnings gaps, but even among part-time workers, people with disabilities earn less than those without disabilities and experience wage penalties that can vary across occupations. By focusing on the reasons for part-time work and its ejects across occupational groups, our analysis highlights structural factors-beyond disability statusthat shape employment outcomes and are not fully addressed by equal pay policies for part-and full-time workers."}}

Despite no capital implications or public disclosures, participating banks significantly reduced credit to greenhouse gas-intensive industries relative to nonparticipants. Among affected firms, smaller borrowers were more negatively impacted. Notably, only the best-performing banks in the climate stress test significantly reduce their brown credit after participation. This is evidence that banks which are more advanced in climate risk management more proactively consider transition risks in their lending. In contrast, banks less advanced in managing climate risk do not to the same extent discriminate against polluting firms."}}

Based on 25 interviews with various \"experts\" (including academics, researchers, and activists) working on the Rohingya crisis, this paper explores to what extent the \"experts\" can play a meaningful role in resolving this crisis. Our evidence suggests that a nonchalant, non-responsive practice limits the roles of \"experts\" in making meaningful contributions towards effective policy formulation for this crisis.

We argue that this ambiguity arises from failing to account for heterogeneity in local cyclical conditions at the time of policy changes, which leads state-dependent responses to obscure underlying cross-country differences. To address this, we construct a measure of country-specific monetary policy that internalizes local cyclical conditions. This adjustment reveals systematic asymmetries in policy transmission between core and periphery euro area countries that conventional methods overlook. We find that macroeconomic and financial variables respond more strongly in periphery countries. In contrast, credit and housing booms are largely absent in core countries. This differential response is consistent with the bank lending channel of monetary policy: banks in periphery countries ease mortgage lending standards following an expansionary shock, while those in core countries tighten them. Cross-border banking flow patterns further corroborate the importance of credit supply in explaining regional heterogeneity."}}

Doing so requires distilling dispersed qualitative information into quantitative data. Integrating the historical record implicit in a large language model (LLM) with facts from secondary sources, we generate an annual index of print censorship. Applying a machine-learning (ML) algorithm to a major corpus, we construct document-level measures of the innovativeness (quality) and volume (quantity) of cultural production. We use pre-existing topic-model estimates to apportion each document among distinct cultural themes-three affected by censorship and five unaffected. We thereby assemble a yearly theme-level panel for 1525-1700. We use local projections to estimate censorship's dynamic effects. Paradoxically, censorship raises the level of innovativeness in censorship-affected themes relative to non-affected themes. Censorship has a temporary chilling effect on the quantity of cultural production, with output recovering within a decade. Our findings are robust to the use of an instrumental-variable approach addressing the endogeneity of censorship. Our findings are unchanged when using three alternative LLMs to produce the censorship index. Using LLMs and ML to measure hard-to-quantify phenomena like censorship and cultural production, we provide new insights into the drivers of cultural evolution."}}

We find that markets react positively to the rule's adoption, especially for firms whose officers and directors sold frequently or profitably under 10b5-1. The response is stronger for firms whose insiders exhibit 10b5-1 trading behaviors targeted by the rule-such as short cooling-off periods or trades shortly before earnings announcements-and becomes especially pronounced in response to the SEC's first 10b5-1 enforcement action. We observe a sharp decline in 10b5-1 trading volume and profitability, and changes in firm-level insider trading policy following amendment proposal and implementation. Overall, the findings suggest that targeted regulation and enforcement can deter opportunistic trading and enhance shareholder value."}}

Based on these observed patterns, we develop an economic model where civilians choose where to commit crimes while officers choose where to patrol, generating testable predictions about the conditions under which crime concentrates. Finally, we conduct a laboratory experiment that tests these theoretical predictions in a controlled environment.

Although useful and informative, aggregating multiple dimensions into a single measure complicates consumers' inference of true product quality, particularly when sellers adjust prices strategically and detailed historical data are unavailable. This paper examines whether social learning, in which consumers accurately infer product quality from ratings, remains feasible under these challenges. We demonstrate that social learning is indeed achievable: even if sellers fully extract consumer surplus, pushing ratings toward neutrality, subtle signals persist, allowing consumers to infer true quality using only the current rating. However, we find that strategic pricing by sellers creates recency bias, significantly reducing learning efficiency. To address this, we propose a simple yet optimal weighted-average rating mechanism. This mechanism relies solely on current data but achieves efficient social learning comparable to a full-history benchmark, highlighting that effective information aggregation can substitute for detailed historical disclosure."}}

Additionally, the unilateral trade measures imposed by the United States have triggered follow-up actions from other nations, resulting in reciprocal countermeasures. It is critical to determine how to respond to reciprocal tariffs in a manner that preserves the integrity of the multilateral trading system.

It targeted National immunization programme managers and National Immunization Technical Advisory Group chairs across all 22 EMR countries. The questionnaire explored five thematic areas: current capacity in health economics and vaccine financing, training and capacity-building needs,  demand for technical and analytical support, data availability and use in decision-making, and strategic planning for vaccine financing. The survey used multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and open-ended questions. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and disaggregated by in-come level.ResultsThe response rate was 73% (16 / 22 countries). Only three countries (19%) reported full integration of health economics into immunization programmes, while nine (56%) reported minimal or no integration. Three countries had a dedicated health economics focal person for immunization. Two HICs demonstrated stronger capacity in health economics, whereas the rest of countries demonstrated low to moderate levels. Ten countries (63%) rated their capacity in financial forecasting and planning for immunization as moderate or high, but eleven (69%) rated their capacity in cost-effectiveness analysis and vaccine financial sustainability as low to none. Access to data varied, with 25% finding it easily accessible. Nine countries (56%) relied mainly on domestic government funds for vaccine procurement, but only six (38%) for immunization operations, with three LICs still reliant on external donor support.ConclusionThe findings highlight a need to strengthen the integration of health economics into immunization programmes across the EMR, regardless of income level. Tailored capacity-building, technical support, and cross-sectoral collaboration, particularly with academia, are essential."}}

Drawing on Elinor Ostrom's concept of polycentric governance, we propose a framework in which decentralized decision centers manage AI development and oversight collaboratively. Such an approach preserves local autonomy while facilitating cross-community learning, helping to mitigate risks related to bias amplification, single points of failure, and systemic fragility. We use real-world examples to show how polycentric structures can foster innovation, resilience, and ethical deployment of AI. By coupling the computational power of AI with decentralized, context-rich governance, society can harness emerging technologies without sacrificing the local knowledge and human creativity that underpin genuine progress."}}

Improving the energy efficiency and energy performance of homes will entail major investment decisions for governments, housing bodies and individuals. Investigating the relationship between house prices and Energy Performance Certificate ratings can inform the decision-making process for those energy efficiency investments, as well as the design and evaluation of home retrofit programmes and supports. Utilising a hedonic pricing methodology, this paper examines the influence of energy efficiency attributes on the price of housing in Dublin, Ireland. The analysis is applied to a data set of over 11,000 properties in which property prices from 2019-2022 are linked to factors pertaining to the quality and location of the property as well as the Irish BER system. The model assesses the monetary value of an uplift in BER, while controlling for factors relating to the home’s size, quality and location as well as the time of sale. Results indicate that a 10% improvement in BER performance is associated with a 0.6% increase in price. This relationship equates to a price premium of 2.6% for A and B rated homes as compared to D rated homes. In the context of an average 3-bed semi-detached home in Dublin, this translates to €12,200 of added capital value with consequent relevance for individual investment decisions and policy support strategies."}}

It remains dependent on imports, posing crucial maritime-policy challenges for national resource-management and the livelihoods of coastal-communities. This study proposes the \"Nusantara-Sea-Salt-Blueprint (NSSB),\" a comprehensive policy blueprint aimed at achieving salt self-sufficiency by 2029. NSSB integrates two main strategies: the People&apos;s Salt Economy Center (SEGAR) economic cluster and the Flagship-Research-Program. SEGAR aims to modernize production, strengthen institutions where currently only 35% of sampled farmers are cooperative members, and encourage downstream industries. Meanwhile, Flagship-Research focuses on applied innovations to improve productivity, quality, and added value. This study uses a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative) to analyze industry conditions and challenges through statistical, policy, and primary data. The analysis results show significant potential for improvement through technology; the productivity of geomembrane ponds (averaging 105.3 tons/ha/season) is significantly higher than that of traditional methods (65.8 tons/ha/season). Institutional-factors such as cooperative-membership are also significant (Odds-Ratio 4.482) in driving technology-adoption. Geospatial-mapping successfully identified 15,500 hectares of potential land categorized as Highly-Suitable (S1) for the development of SEGAR clusters in 10-target-provinces. The NSSB detailed the SEGAR development strategy, including strengthening cooperatives and modernizing infrastructure, and formulated a roadmap for Flagship-Research, prioritizing the adoption of high TRL technology, product diversification, and sustainable practices.

We develop a real Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy, incorporating government transfers and public investment as fiscal spending components, along with two prominent characteristics of LICs: Dutch disease (DD) externalities and financially constrained households. Driven by considerations of precautionary saving, Ramsey-optimal policies involve partial reserve accumulation and partial fiscal spending of aid. Stronger DD externalities necessitate greater reserve ac- cumulation to stabilize future output, thereby mitigating consumption volatility. While transfers directly support private consumption smoothing, public investment also con- tributes to this goal by sustaining future income through gradual capital accumulation. Higher aid volatility calls for increased public investment, underscoring the role of public capital accumulation as a precautionary saving instrument, beyond its developmental role discussed in the literature."}}

Syndromic visits were defined as those with fever (≥38.0 °C) or respiratory symptoms. Age-stratified autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were trained on data from 2017–2018 and 2020–2021 to forecast syndromic ED visits in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Alarms were triggered when observed visit counts exceeded both the model’s 95th percentile prediction interval and historical day-of-week thresholds. Alarm performance was assessed against ED discharge diagnoses of respiratory infectious diseases.Results: The system performed well under stable pre-pandemic conditions, particularly among children aged 0–4 years (3-day alarm sensitivity: 1.000; specificity: 0.964), and moderately among adults aged 65 years and older. In contrast, model performance deteriorated in 2022 under pandemic conditions, especially among adults aged 20–64 years, with alarm sensitivity dropping below 0.300. The decline was driven by persistently elevated syndromic activity during the Omicron wave, which overwhelmed the static thresholds of the ARIMA models.Conclusion: ED-based SyS can offer timely and specific early warning for seasonal respiratory outbreaks, particularly in pediatric populations. However, its utility is limited during sustained pandemic waves. Future surveillance systems must incorporate adaptive models, dynamic thresholds, and multiple data streams to remain effective under evolving epidemiological baselines."}}

However, few studies have investigated the impact of the characteristics of the live-streaming sales channel on multi-channel market operations. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the impact of information externalities and purchase costs in live-streaming sales within a dual-channel market. We develop a theoretical model for a manufacturer operating both traditional offline and live-streaming channels to determine optimal strategies. Considering that consumers may prefer both offline and live-streaming channels makes our research more comprehensive. According to our analysis, under varying consumer channel preferences, an increase in information externalities helps improve the profits of both channels, whereas an increase in purchasing costs would reduce the profits of both channels. Further, we identify conditions for profitable coexistence of dual channels and analyze optimal pricing strategies for the manufacturer and the live-streaming channel. These findings offer valuable insights into how manufacturers can conduct live-streaming sales in a dual-channel environment and also provide theoretical support for understanding the characteristics of live-streaming sales."}}

Using a qualitative approach based on Grounded Theory, in-depth interviews were conducted with 120 participants, including clients and employees from Gulf banks. The analysis revealed that integrating human-centered design elements into FinTech platforms significantly enhances dimensions such as personalization, trust, emotional connection, usability, and overall customer satisfaction. Four key themes emerged from the coding process: human responsiveness in digital design, control and trust through technology, the human gap in digital experiences, and the need for a smooth and intuitive digital journey. These themes culminated in a core category that underpins the grounded theory: the interactive integration of technology and humanity in the digital banking experience. The study concludes that true customer-centered value can only be achieved when technological sophistication is combined with emotional intelligence and ethical interaction. The findings offer practical recommendations for banks, including investing in ethical AI, transparent blockchain integration, human-centric design, and inclusive digital services for all customer groups. The study emphasizes that innovation in FinTech must be guided by human values to ensure long-term customer engagement and loyalty."}}

Five core design principles of adaptability, accessibility, affordability, acceleration, and alignment are derived from a multiphased formal analysis to guide the development of the R²PIVS pipeline in six modules: retrieval, reality capture, prediction, interaction, visualization, and summarization. The pipeline leverages human-AI collaboration for building inventory tasks, such as geometry measurement, visual inspection, and hazard inference. The framework supports mixed-initiative workflows through interactive annotation, model refinement, and prediction validation. By aligning machine learning capabilities with domain requirements, this research establishes a foundation for designing and implementing a scalable, human-in-the-loop building audit system that enable standardized, data-rich assessments and collaborative decision-making for circular construction throughout the building life cycle."}}

This paper presents a deep learning-based voice cloning system designed to generate expressive, speaker specific audiobook narrations using neural text-to-speech (TTS) techniques. The proposed system employs XTTS v2 for high-fidelity, multilingual speech synthesis and incorporates a pre-trained speaker encoder to extract voice characteristics from short user-provided audio samples. The entire pipeline operates offline, enabling private, real-time inference in environments with limited or no internet connectivity. Given a text input, the system produces audio output that closely mimics the target speaker's voice characteristics. To enhance clarity and user control, the system allows parameter adjustments such as speech speed, pitch, and expressiveness. A Streamlit-based graphical interface facilitates user interaction, supporting voice sample uploads, text input, real-time playback, waveform visualization, and audio downloads. The modular and scalable architecture is designed to support multiple voice presets, with future extensibility toward emotional tone modulation and multispeaker synthesis. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system consistently generates natural, intelligible, and personalized speech, as verified through subjective listening tests and waveform analyses.

Although existing methods can effectively alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems by introducing rich auxiliary knowledge, it is still susceptible to interference caused by redundant relations and semantic discrepancies, which prevents the model from effectively focusing on explicit relation-aware principles. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised recommendation method Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation via Knowledge-Aware Reasoning, called KGCR. Firstly, we perform relation modeling by leveraging relation-aware scores of knowledge triples to infer critical information within local neighborhoods. Then, this information is extended to user-item relationships to learn more valuable latent information. Finally, we introduce cross-view contrastive learning to further exploit graph structural information. Specifically, we consider the User-item Interaction Graph (UIG) as the collaborative view and the knowledge graph as the semantic view, optimizing the rationality enhancement mechanism for both views based on perception scores. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that KGCR outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models across three public datasets. The code of KGCR is available at https://github.com/agionyy/KGCR."}}

In the cross section, the excess supply of local-currency savings is the key determinant of low relative interest rates, negative covered and uncovered currency premia, cheap forward dollars; and vice versa. In the time series, covered currency premia change infrequently and in concert across currencies, driven by aggregate financial market conditions. In contrast, uncovered currency premia move frequently in response to currency-specific demand shocks, which we capture with the dynamics of net currency futures positions of dealer banks. Sharp exchange rate depreciations in response to negative shifts in currency demand are followed by small persistent predictable appreciations that generate future positive expected currency returns necessary to ensure intermediation of currency demand shocks, irrespective of their financial or macroeconomic origin. Changes in net futures positions of dealer banks account for most of the variation in the spot exchange rate for every currency."}}

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) plays a central role, providing a robust framework to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of transmitted data. However, advances in Quantum Computing pose a significant threat to current public-key cryptographic schemes by enabling efficient solutions to factoring and discrete logarithm problems. A promising solution also arises from the quantum domain. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides a security layer immune to any computational attacks, whether quantum or classical. While the rapid adoption of quantum-safe technologies is highly desirable, it is equally important to ensure the resilience of existing trusted infrastructures, as the introduction of novel technologies may also entail unforeseen challenges. Enabling an evolutionary path that brings our current security infrastructure to a quantum-safe one, protected against both present and future threats, is thus very important. This work proposes a solution that integrates emerging quantum technologies into the existing security and communications infrastructure to ensure long-term protection. We focus on IPsec —one of the most widely deployed security protocols— and combine it with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and QKD to construct a novel network security infrastructure that is resilient against both classical and quantum computational threats. Building upon recent standardization initiatives and operational tools for QKD integration, we demonstrate advanced capabilities -including rekeying and secure key transport- on a field deployed QKD network operating within a shared quantum-classical production infrastructure."}}

Our main objective is to address an apparent need concerning small business cybersecurity. We propose a practical framework aimed at enhancing small business cybersecurity readiness augmented with affordable tools. Enhancing small businesses cybersecurity is imperative given the role they play as a driving force for growth, investment and innovation and for ensuring stability in labor force markets and the economy. Their adoption of various digital technologies during the pandemic has softened its severe effects and ensured continuous activity. Yet, it also exposed small business to cyber related risks. Given their limited resources and nimble operations, many forgo installing more comprehensive cybersecurity systems. Our paper seeks to address this apparent gap and shortcoming. Design/Methodology. Accessing a large collection of extant works on cybersecurity and employing a strict search criteria that are most relevant to subject matter, we located 50 studies on business related cybersecurity of which only 10 have dealt with small business per se. We used thematic analysis to establish evidence-based themes derived from these studies' findings in support of a possible practical cybersecurity readiness model and recommendations. Findings. Three evidence-based themes emerged-Strong organizational culture, proactive technology adoption and active risk management strategy. These three pillars are the foundation upon which a sound cybersecurity readiness framework rests. These very pillars also serve as the building blocks of our proposed model that seeks to enhance organizational resilience against evolving cyber threats. Originality/Value. Borrowing from the extant literature and anchored in tenets of our theoretical framework-the risk homeostasis theory and the technology-organization-environment (TOE), our paper adds some rigor to the existing paucity of works on small business and cybersecurity. The proposed model addresses specific and timely needs designed to strengthen small business readiness for effectively guarding against potential cyber risks. We further discuss related practical implications and offer concrete actionable roadmap and recommendations tailored to resource limited small businesses."}}

We study the effects of this practice by combining a field experiment that hides brands owned by Amazon (i.e., private labels) from shoppers on Amazon.com with model-based counterfactuals and welfare analysis. In the absence of private labels, consumers substitute toward products that are similar along most observable dimensions. Removing Amazon brands does not change consumers' search effort or their propensity to shop at other retail websites. Despite the ample availability of observably similar alternatives, our welfare estimates imply that, for the categories we study, removing Amazon brands would reduce consumer surplus by 5.5 percent in the short run, with approximately 10 percent of the impact due to equilibrium price increases by other sellers. The effects are heterogeneous, with consumer surplus reductions exceeding 10 percent in some categories, while other categories realize much smaller decreases when Amazon brands are removed. Demoting private labels in search results to counteract potential self-preferencing does not lead to gains in consumer surplus. This outcome arises because a subset of consumers derive greater utility from private labels and benefit from their high placement in search results."}}

We expand on that research by conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and \"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that representational bias in LLMs has a winner-takes-all quality that is more biased than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental changes in model development. Dataset"}}

Previous research on human-XAI interaction has shown that explainability may help mitigate black-box problems but also unintentionally alter individuals' cognitive processes, e.g., distorting their reasoning and evoking informational overload. While empirical evidence on the impact of XAI on how individuals \"think\" is growing, it has been largely overlooked whether XAI can even affect individuals' \"thinking about thinking\", i.e., metacognition, which theory conceptualizes to monitor and control previously-studied thinking processes. Aiming to take a first step in filling this gap, we investigate whether XAI affects confidence calibrations, and, thereby, decisions to transfer decision-making responsibility to AI, on the meta-level of cognition. We conduct two incentivized experiments in which human experts repeatedly perform prediction tasks, with the option to delegate each task to an AI. We exogenously vary whether participants initially receive explanations that reveal the AI's underlying prediction logic. We find that XAI improves individuals' metaknowledge (the alignment between confidence and actual performance) and partially enhances confidence sensitivity (the variation of confidence with task performance). These metacognitive shifts causally increase both the frequency and effectiveness of human-to-AI delegation decisions. Interestingly, these effects only occur when explanations reveal to individuals that AI's logic diverges from their own, leading to a systematic reduction in confidence. Our findings suggest that XAI can correct overconfidence at the potential cost of lowering confidence even when individuals perform well. Both effects influence decisions to cede responsibility to AI, highlighting metacognition as a central mechanism in human-XAI collaboration."}}

Acting as translators, LLMs can enhance interoperability across multi-formalism, multi-semantics, and multi-paradigm systems. We address two key challenges: identifying appropriate languages and tools for modeling and simulation tasks, and developing efficient software architectures that integrate LLMs without performance bottlenecks. To this end, the paper explores LLM-mediated workflows, emphasizes structured tool integration, and recommends Low-Rank Adaptation-based architectures for efficient task-specific adaptations. This approach ensures LLMs complement rather than replace specialized tools, fostering high-quality, reliable M&amp;S processes."}}

While Multi-Agent Trust Region Learning (MATRL) ensures Nash equilibrium convergence, it risks data exposure and malicious attacks. To address this, we propose Trustworthy Distributed Mirror Learning (TDML), the first method to unify convergence, verifiability, and privacy in MARL. TDML theoretically breaks MATRL’s centralized architecture into agent-local learning and inter-agent communication. This allows key data to be secured with advanced techniques without compromising the theoretical properties of trust-region learning. Specifically, TDML introduces three core innovations: 1) an information functional that unifies all communication behaviors in distributed MATRL and enables flexible integration of security mechanisms; 2) split advantage computation, which decouples raw inputs from global advantages via intermediate representations to protect local data privacy; and 3) a security scheme that ensures verifiable message exchange by attaching zero-knowledge proofs to inter-agent communications. We prove TDML converges to a Nash equilibrium while providing verifiability and privacy guarantees. More importantly, it constructs a mirror space for trustworthy MARL, where derivative algorithms inherit these theoretical guarantees. Experiments show TDML outperforms state-of-the-art methods in convergence, robustness, and privacy. Its practical value is further validated through a warehouse robot picking task, showing strong resilience against malicious attacks."}}

The upgrading of industrial structure is divided into two mediating paths: industrial structure rationalization (Indr), measured by the Theil index, and industrial structure upgrading (Indh), measured by the angle method of tertiary industry vectors. Empirical results indicate that internet development has a significant positive impact on rural income (p < 0.05), with Indh playing a critical mediating role (Bootstrap p < 0.01), while the Indr path is not statistically significant. Specifically, internet penetration promotes income growth by increasing the share of high-tech and modern service sectors. In contrast, improvements in resource allocation efficiency have not yet formed a stable transmission mechanism. Control variable analysis shows that regional economic level and urbanization rate also have significant positive effects on income growth. These findings confirm the structural role of the internet in advancing rural industrial transformation and income growth, offering quantitative evidence to support rural revitalization policies driven by the digital economy."}}

Building on real-time analysis of unprecedented executive targeting of the legal profession, this research demonstrates how discrete institutional vulnerabilities interact through the \"politically primordial vortex\"-cascading feedback loops that create self-reinforcing cycles of democratic breakdown exponentially more difficult to reverse than prevent. Through systematic analysis of executive orders targeting law firms, resulting in nearly $1 billion in coercive settlements and unanimous judicial constitutional rejection across four federal courts, this framework establishes measurable thresholds for distinguishing constitutional emergency from normal political competition. The research demonstrates that American constitutional democracy exhibits patterns consistent with Phase 3 vortex acceleration, where normal constitutional correction mechanisms have become structurally inadequate due to gerrymandering-induced legislative capture creating \"constitutional amendment impossibility.\" The framework reveals four discretization mechanisms operating simultaneously: geographic discretization through gerrymandering that predetermines 84% of electoral outcomes; temporal discretization restricting democratic participation to manipulable windows; institutional discretization fragmenting oversight into capturable segments; and informational discretization destroying shared epistemic foundations necessary for democratic deliberation. These mechanisms, validated through cross-national comparison and real-time constitutional crisis documentation, provide scholars and practitioners with diagnostic tools for early detection and response to systematic democratic breakdown. This research contributes to constitutional scholarship by: (1) providing systematic theory where only descriptive analysis existed; (2) establishing empirical thresholds for constitutional crisis identification; (3) demonstrating real-time validation of theoretical predictions; (4) extending constitutional coercion doctrine to private entities; and (5) creating replicable frameworks for urgent democratic defense. While requiring further validation through independent replication and longitudinal testing, the framework offers immediately applicable tools for understanding and responding to contemporary threats to constitutional governance."}}

Over the past century, cognitive and developmental theories—from the Four Stages of Competence and Piaget’s developmental stages to hierarchical decision-making models and psychoanalytic insights—have illuminated essential facets of human thought. However, none capture the nuanced transitions through intuitive, analytic, creative, and meta-cognitive modes essential for real-world judgment. Moreover, these models neglect how individuals develop flexible awareness needed for expertise and resilience when confronting uncertainty and risk.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Further, the dual-process models do not explain how people progress beyond System 1 and System 2 to achieve extraordinary creativity, meta-level self-regulation, or reduce Kahneman’s “noise,” the pervasive variability in judgments. Similarly, while Flow Theory identifies immersive peak states that yield profound creativity and performance, and metacognition research reveals how self-monitoring enhances decision stability, these insights remain absent from foundational economic models like Prospect Theory.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This paper synthesizes these fragmented perspectives through a novel, four-layer model of thinking that places&nbsp;awareness&nbsp;as the central driver of cognitive flexibility and decision quality. By integrating perceptual, attentional, deliberative, flow, and meta-conscious states into a unified developmental framework, we provide a comprehensive architecture that moves decision theory beyond binary dual-process limits. This integrated approach explains not only what decisions people make but&nbsp;why&nbsp;and&nbsp;how&nbsp;they evolve towards higher-order thinking and stable, creative judgment. Our model opens new avenues for research and practical interventions designed to cultivate awareness, reduce cognitive noise, and optimize decision-making in complex environments.</p>"}}

We test this conventional wisdom using granular emissions data from CDP. Pairing emissions data with firms' financials, we show that most of the emission reduction benefits emerge organically with the scale of operations. Using causal inference techniques, we show that, absent the scale, an improvement in inventory productivity results in higher emission intensity in aggregate across scopes, in Scope 3, and its categories of purchased goods and services and waste from operations. The effect on Scope 1 and 2 emissions is negative. The effect is concentrated in the non-essential retail segments, excluding food and beverage, and health and personal care retailers. Thus, an implementation of lean inventory practices in non-essential retail should be undertaken cautiously, and in coordination with the upstream supply chain, because it increases carbon intensity on average, and particularly in the Scope 3 dimensions of purchased goods and services as well as waste from operations."}}

However, conventional diesel tugboats generate substantial emissions during operations, prompting seaport operators to adopt electric alternatives. This paper studies the electric tugboat scheduling problem to simultaneously optimize the working and charging schedules of electric tugboats. The complexity of this problem arises from (i) time consistency constraints that require multiple electric tugboats to work simultaneously, (ii) service sequence constraints that establish precedence relationships between different tugging services, and (iii) nonlinear charging profiles of electric tugboats. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model. A tailored branch-and-price (BP) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. To handle the time consistency constraints and service sequence constraints that incur interdependence among schedules in the BP framework, two types of customized feasibility branching strategies are introduced. Additionally, the BP algorithm is further enhanced through an improved restricted master problem that provides tighter lower bounds and a customized bi-directional labeling algorithm that solves pricing subproblems. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution method are evaluated using numerical experiments based on operational data from a container terminal in Shanghai. The computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm."}}

A central strategic decision many platforms face is whether to take on the donation responsibility themselves (i.e., altruism by choice) or delegate it to their sellers (i.e., altruism by proxy). Motivated by this binary selection, this paper develops a game-theoretic model consisting of a platform and two competing sellers to analyze and compare the various donation strategies observed in practice. Leveraging the commission structure commonly seen in e-commerce, we demonstrate that under altruism by choice, the platform may over-donate, while under altruism by proxy, competing sellers always under-donate. Interestingly, although altruism by choice appears more costly, it could emerge as the platform's optimal strategy, particularly when the platform's commission rate is high but the consumers' prosocial level is low. Otherwise, altruism by proxy is preferred, and the platform may benefit from providing proportional commission reductions to subsidize donating sellers. We further examine the preferences of the sellers and partnering charities over various donation strategies, and propose a three-pronged framework based on our analytical results to safeguard their interests."}}

We model the problem as a continuous-time control process in a queueing system with impatient customers whose purchase decisions follow a general discrete choice model affected by the waiting time. Each product is characterized by its margin and service time, and the firm's objective is to dynamically select assortments to maximize long-run average profits. We establish the existence of optimality equations and concavity of the solution function, and characterize optimal state-dependent policies under general choice behavior. Under the multinomial logit (MNL) model, we show that the optimal assortment follows an adjusted-margin ordering, where product rankings shift at most once as congestion increases. To investigate the structure of optimal assortment across congestion levels, we characterize conditions under which the optimal assortment expands, contracts, or changes non-monotonically with congestion. Furthermore, we extend the model to incorporate dynamic pricing and identify an optimal policy that maintains a full assortment while adjusting prices to satisfy a constant adjusted-margin condition. Finally, our numerical experiments demonstrate profit improvements of dynamic policies over static benchmarks, underscoring the value of state-dependent assortment control in congested service environments."}}

From the regulator's perspective, the average costs associated with an environmental violation serve as a lower bound on the fine that should be levied.

Key features include public participation windows, a micro-grant program, mandatory lessons-learned reporting, and clear pathways for scaling or sunsetting pilots. This Act provides a blueprint for accountable, adaptive, and outcome-driven public-sector innovation."}}

On July 28, 2025, Argentina signed a statement of intent with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to return to the program after 23 years of absence, while Brazil faces increasing scrutiny due to overstay rates and reciprocal visa policies. Based on official DHS data, Argentina currently has the lowest overstay rate in Latin America (0.97% in FY2023), while Brazil maintains a 1.62% rate and faces institutionalized distrust after reinstating visa requirements for American citizens in April 2025. The study examines the determining factors for VWP participation through the theoretical framework of \"migratory soft power\" and \"institutional compliance,\" analyzing how geopolitical realignments influence bilateral migration policies. The analysis reveals that prior exclusions can be reversed through diplomatic convergence and migration flow discipline, contributing to contemporary debates on international mobility, migration diplomacy, and hemispheric security cooperation. This research offers the first systematic academic analysis of Argentina's return to the VWP process and its implications for hemispheric migration diplomacy, providing an original framework for understanding how technical migration indicators intersect with broader geopolitical considerations in asymmetric diplomatic relationships.</span>"}}

Data from the California Prescribed Fire Monitoring Program revealed that prescribed fires reduced total fuel loads by an average of 60%, with greater consumption of postfrontal smoldering fuels (coarse fuels, 65%) compared to frontline spreading fuels (fine fuels, 49.0%). Crown scorch height showed a strong relationship to crown base height (R² = 0.37-0.86), suggesting that practitioners use crown base height as a visual indicator to control fire intensity and avoid crown damage. This relationship may partially explain fuel consumption patterns, as crown avoidance strategies can influence fire behavior and intensity. Additionally, we documented a compensatory relationship between live and dead fuel moisture content across burn seasons, indicating that practitioners strategically select burning windows that maintain fire intensity within controllable parameters regardless of season. Our findings demonstrate that human decisions fundamentally modify prescribed fire behavior to maintain safety parameters, often constraining outcomes to conservative ranges that may compromise treatment effectiveness. Understanding and accounting for these human factors is crucial to encouraging a more effective use of prescribed fires in the future. We recommend that future research explicitly include operational parameters and practitioner decision-making processes in assessing prescribed fire science, balancing safety considerations with goals for ecological restoration."}}

Previous studies have relied on employment likelihood as a key measure of refugee integration, and used it as a quality score to guide optimal placement decisions of refugees into communities. Motivated by the inherent uncertainty in these point estimates, we propose risk-averse placement optimization models and examine the extent to which uncertainty can be appropriately incorporated in light of the risk preferences of the decision-makers. Building on classical mean-risk approaches that emphasize aggregate trade-offs, we develop alternative optimization formulations that incorporate family-level risk around the employment likelihood of individual refugee families, achieving stronger risk reduction while maintaining expected outcomes. The varying levels of risk reduction observed across families provides further motivation to pursue fairness in allocation, so that particularly vulnerable refugees with the lowest employment likelihoods are not disproportionally disadvantaged. Computational experiments on actual refugee data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization approaches, offering practical advances over current placement approaches based solely on expected outcomes. Our research offers important managerial insights into operational improvements in refugee resettlement, demonstrating the value of risk-aware approaches that empower decision makers to optimize placement decisions while mitigating outcome uncertainties for refugees."}}

To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive predictive maintenance strategy based on conservative RUL (CRUL) predictions, which seeks to achieve more efficient asset management by integrating precise CRUL forecasting with sound maintenance decision-making. In the CRUL prediction component, this study introduces an innovative 1D-CNN-Informer model that combines one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) with the Informer architecture to comprehensively capture the temporal patterns in operational data, thereby facilitating efficient and accurate RUL predictions. Furthermore, the ``insurance factor (IF)\" is introduced to incorporate risk management into the predictive process. By adjusting the value of the IF, the model&apos;s conservative bias toward RUL estimation can be dynamically regulated, mitigating potential risks associated with overly optimistic forecasts. In the maintenance decision-making aspect, this paper accounts for the stochastic nature of maintenance lead times and further classifies their uncertainty into cognitive and random components. Leveraging these uncertainties, we propose a dynamic decision-making mechanism that effectively distinguishes between corrective and predictive maintenance decisions, ensuring the selection of the most suitable maintenance strategy under various circumstances.

However, existing methods often overlook the physical characteristics of different energy loads, which makes it challenging to precisely capture their spatio-temporal evolution patterns. Moreover, these methods typically focus on minimizing statistical errors, neglecting the asymmetric impact of prediction errors on the downstream decision-making process. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model named risk-aware synergy large language model (RSynLLM). This model incorporates a routing mixture-of-experts framework, with tailored load experts designed to thoroughly analyze the distinct physical characteristics of various energy loads. A dynamic router adaptively assigns weights to these experts based on their respective contributions. Additionally, we introduce a risk-aware loss function that asymmetrically evaluates prediction errors while explicitly quantifying tail risks. This drives the LLM to actively suppress load underestimation tendencies and mitigate the risks of sudden disruptions, thereby aligning predictions with downstream decision-making objectives. Furthermore, customized prompt instructions are designed to guide the LLM in accurately perceiving the spatio-temporal evolution patterns of multi-energy loads. Extensive simulations conducted on a novel large-scale multi-energy PDN dataset, built using real-world data, demonstrate that the proposed RSynLLM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and risk awareness.

First, the event log is recorded from the process system. The activity communities from the event log are obtained based on the algorithm of community discovery. A process model is also obtained from the event log using a process discovery algorithm. Second, according to the rules, the activity communities are executed as merge or split to obtain the target process fragments of the process model. The prefixes generated from the event logs are deployed to different servers to obtain multiple buckets of prefixes. The Gated Recurrent Unit neural network is trained for each bucket of prefixes using deep transfer learning. Finally, six event logs are conducted to verify the feasibility of our method.

However, traditional Shape from Shading (SFS) techniques, heavily reliant on idealized lighting models and constraint conditions, exhibit limited adaptability for reconstructing machined surfaces with non-homogeneous materials, complex curvatures, and local abrupt features, making it difficult to achieve precise reconstruction of concave-convex surface. To meet the demand for online rapid detection of complex functional structures in manufacturing, this paper proposes an analytical reconstruction method for complex machined surfaces based on Concave-convex recognition. Based on the spatial geometric characteristics between the machined surface and the imaging plane, a quantitative model mapping surface gradients to image grayscale was established. The principles of image formation for sharp and blurred images were analyzed, and the basis for characterizing concave-convex surface was elucidated. An improved multi-scale Tenengrad gradient function was proposed. By integrating the surface gradient to image grayscale mapping model with the topography characterization function, an analytical reconstruction method for machined surfaces was developed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed analytical reconstruction method can rapidly and accurately identify surface features, with favorable accuracy and computational efficiency. This research provides a theoretical foundation and technical support for online inspection of machined surface quality in high-dynamic environments."}}

While artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly adopted to replace or monitor workers, the unintended psychological consequences of this shift have received little attention. This study introduces the concept of perceived risk with AI, defined as workers’ subjective perception of potential negative consequences of employee AI collaboration. Drawing on self-determination theory, which emphasizes individuals’ core psychological needs, we propose an inside-out theoretical model. This model explains how construction workers’ perceived risk with AI triggers unsafe behavior through two internal psychological pathways: emotional exhaustion and organizational identification. We further identify AI failure as a critical boundary condition that amplifies these effects. Data were collected from 343 frontline workers at a smart construction site where AI actively interact with human labor. Results indicate that perceived risk with AI increases unsafe behavior, and this relationship is mediated by both heightened emotional exhaustion and weakened organizational identification. Notably, these effects are significantly amplified when AI malfunctions occur. Our findings not only extend the application scope of self-determination theory but also contribute to the knowledge base on workers’ unsafe behavior in the context of human-AI coexistence. Practically, the study offers actionable insights for managers to mitigate the unintended side effects of AI implementation on worker safety."}}

It is particularly prevalent amongst children, adolescent, and young adults. Unlike traditional bullying, cyber bullying transcends physical boundaries and time, occurring anytime and anywhere. The anonymity afforded by technology emboldens perpetrators, making it challenging to identify and hold them accountable.

However, existing methods often fall short in extracting deep spatial relationships and adapting to dynamically evolving scheduling scenarios influenced by multiple constraints. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a construction scheduling optimization framework based on Graph Neural Network (GNN)--driven spatial semantic reasoning.First, a three-dimensional spatial semantic graph is constructed from BIM data, integrating geometric, topological, and attribute information to explicitly represent complex spatial relationships such as containment, embedding, and contact among components. Then, an enhanced GraphSAGE model is introduced to learn implicit \"precedence\" dependencies between components, replacing static rule templates and improving the generalization and adaptability of scheduling logic.Furthermore, a Dynamic Layering Scheduling Algorithm (DLSA) is designed based on spatial adjacency and parallel constructability, enabling structured and controllable scheduling. A multi-dimensional priority model is also developed, incorporating component criticality, spatial location, and resource conflicts to dynamically generate construction sequences.Experiments were conducted on three representative BIM project models. The results show that the proposed method increased resource utilization (RU) from 73.6% to 87.9%, yielding an improvement of 14.3 percentage points. Meanwhile, the number of abnormal construction events (AC) dropped from 113 to 41, representing a 63.7% reduction.These results highlight the effectiveness, scalability, and practical value of the proposed framework in construction scheduling optimization."}}

Nevertheless, along with this technological advancement come further unsolved problems, such as adversarial machine learning attacks, trust establishment, and transparency maintenance in generative artificial intelligence frameworks. This chapter offers a holistic discussion of the attacks and defenses specific to GAI (such as LLM) with a focus on trust and transparency issues in deploying LLM in the wild. By conducting a systematic literature review using the PRISMA approach, in this work we consolidate extant knowledge on and identify adversarial vulnerabilities in LLMs, their impacts on system resiliency, as well as the multi-faceted requirements associated with trust and transparency in modern AI deployment settings. The review provides insights on adversarial attacks against LLM by considering a plethora of vectors-prompt-injection, data-poisoning, model-inversion and backdoor attacks-which altogether pose their inherent challenges in preserving the system integrity with user confidence. It also uncovers substantial limitations in current transparency models for trust and trustworthiness on generative language models representing calls for new models that can take account for both the evolving and situational nature of generated language model output. The results of our evaluation indicate that, although current mitigations hold initial promise in a controlled laboratory environment, in practice they frequently fail when they are applied in the wild due to the complexity and scale of the operation condition. We hope this chapter helps in unifying the perspectives around risks from adversaries in deployment of LLM, suggest mechanism to enhance transparency in LLM."}}

Theoretical approach: the research focuses on 10 (former) commanders of the Special Police Operations Battalions (BOPE) across various Brazilian states. BOPE is renowned for its specialization in addressing serious crimes within public security. Methods: the research methodology follows a qualitative approach, with data collection conducted through semi-structured interviews applied to a sample of experts. Thematic analysis is employed to structure and interpret the qualitative data, enabling the identification of patterns and themes related to leadership. Results: the findings highlight trust as the cornerstone of the leader–follower relationship within dangerous contexts. This trust is built through daily interactions, shared experiences, the leader’s physical presence, and demonstrations of competence. Leaders are responsible for decision-making and fostering teamwork, with a strong sense of duty and fraternity motivating officers to go above and beyond their professional duties. The hierarchy and discipline inherent to the state police facilitate effective leadership in dangerous contexts. However, in the Brazilian scenario, the lack of adequate equipment has been identified as the main difficulty, hindering the ability of leaders to effectively manage and respond to high-risk situations. Conclusions: this study contributes to the literature on leadership in Brazil, particularly regarding leadership within police organizations operating in dangerous environments — an area that remains largely unexplored in Brazilian academia.\n</div>"}}

We focus on the frequency of under-commitment in salary adjustments-instances where actual salary adjustments fall short of previously announced expectations. Grounded in signaling theory and prospect theory, our findings show that repeated under-commitment in salary adjustments is significantly associated with lower firm value. Mechanism analyses suggest that unmet salary commitments may undermine firm value through employee morale. Cross-sectional tests further reveal that the negative effects are particularly pronounced in firms with higher human capital intensity. Robustness checks confirm the consistency of the results when using alternative definitions of expected salary adjustments and firm value. These effects remain significant after addressing selection bias and endogeneity through Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), entropy balancing, and Propensity Score Matching (PSM). By shifting the focus from executive compensation to workforce-wide practices, this study positions salary adjustments as strategic governance signals. The findings offer practical implications for firms and regulators, especially in emerging markets, seeking to enhance transparency and accountability in labor-related ESG practices. Enhancing transparency and ensuring consistency between promised and actual compensation may be critical for sustaining firm value and stakeholder trust."}}

While the adoption and operation of artificial intelligence provides abundant opportunities for improving processes, decision-making, and innovation, its success is strongly influenced by cultural factors within organizations. Organizational culture, as a set of shared values, beliefs, and behaviors, canIt can be a stimulus or an obstacle to the adoption of new technologies. This research has used two main methods to collect and analyze data: the comparative analytical method and the review method. In the comparative analytical method, previous studies related to organizational culture and AI integration have been reviewed and compared to determine the relationship between these two concepts. In the review method, the existing scientific and industrial research in the field of challenges and opportunities in emerging markets has been evaluated. The data used include scientific articles, industry reports, and case studies from different organizations, and tools such as Hofstede's theoretical frameworks, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Levine's Change Management Model have been used to analyze the data. To analyze the data, first, the cultural factors affecting AI adoption were identified and categorized in the form of analytical tables. Then, the impact of organizational culture on various aspects of AI adoption such as innovation, risk tolerance, hierarchical structures, and employee engagement was investigated. Also, specific challenges of emerging markets such as poor infrastructure, lack of digital skills, and restrictive laws were analyzed. Quantitative Research Method: This research was conducted through interviews with the statistical population including managers and experts of information technology and human resources in different organizations. Using a structured questionnaire, the data were collected and analyzed. This approach helped to identify managers' experiences and practical opinions in the field of AI adoption and provided deeper perspectives on the existing barriers and opportunities. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between organizational culture and success in integrating AI in organizations. In particular, this research aims to identify key cultural factors that facilitate or limit AI adoption. Also, the challenges and opportunities of emerging markets in this field have been evaluated to provide practical solutions for organizations in these areas. The findings of the research show that organizations with an innovation-driven, data-driven, and highrisk tolerance culture are more successful in adopting AI. In contrast, organizations with hierarchical structures and a risk-averse culture face more challenges in this field. In emerging markets, weak infrastructure, lack of digital skills, and restrictive laws make it more difficult to adopt AI. However, employee training, reform Regulatory laws and cooperation between academia and industry can reduce these barriers. This research shows that success in AI integration is highly dependent on organizational culture. Organizations should facilitate the adoption of new technologies by promoting a culture of innovation, employee engagement, and data driven.

Influencers on live-streaming platforms rely on their popularity to attract viewers to free watch their shows and embrace virtual gifts voluntarily rewarded by the viewers. However, to boost potential rewarded gifts, many influencers manipulate their popularity to tempt viewers into their live-streaming rooms, posing a severe challenge to reputation and revenue of the platforms. This paper develops a game-theoretic model in an ecosystem consisting of a live-streaming platform and two competitive influencers with differentiated inherent abilities to explore the influencers’ incentives to manipulate their popularity and evaluate the effectiveness of platform detection in combating popularity manipulation. We find that the low-ability influencer has incentives to engage in popularity manipulation unless the real popularity difference between both influencers is large enough. Within this context, the low-ability influencer offensively conducts popularity manipulation if their real popularity difference is extremely small and the high-ability influencer defensively does that otherwise. Additionally, popularity manipulation increases efforts in self-improvement of the low-ability influencer but decreases those of the high-ability influencer. Interestingly, the platform does not always have incentives to detect popularity manipulation and its detection may backfire and jeopardize viewer welfare and social welfare due to removal of the high-ability influencer falling in violation. To mitigate the inefficiency of platform detection, we further propose a low-popularity-influencer-friendly commission policy that can be used as a complement or substitute tool for platform detection to combat popularity manipulation and may Pareto improve the social welfare."}}

Provisioning, a necessary step in the IoT device life cycle, enables unique identity assignment, network connectivity, and service authorization. However, IoT systems currently reported in the literature often rely on vendor-specific tools or lack scalability and modifiability, which are required to support the current diversity of devices. To address these limitations, this paper presents a digital twin system architecture for the provisioning of heterogeneous IoT devices. The architecture presented here is designed to support diverse IoT device types, each with unique provisioning requirements, while enabling efficient provisioning on an enterprise scale. The architecture enables interoperability with diverse device communication protocols, provisioning methods, and characteristics. By integrating, as is typical for digital twins, the IoT device’s representation with decision-making and control capabilities, the digital twin system acts as a contextually aware orchestrator. Using a proof-of-concept implementation, the paper demonstrates the modifiability of the architecture by supporting both request/response (gRPC) and publish/subscribe (MQTT) communication patterns. The proof-of-concept implementation also exhibits scalability, simultaneously provisioning up to 200 representative IoT devices with minimal impact on the provisioning interval. While the system shows promise in modifiability, further optimizations are required to reduce complexity when adapting to new onboarding and provisioning processes."}}

Avery and Bergsteiner’s Honeybee and Locust sustainable leadership framework was used as the theoretical framework for this purpose. A total of fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with female leaders from a variety of sectors, including corporate finance, tourism, academia, development, and small business enterprises.

In a world where 45% of Americans report they did not seek professional help for clinical mental health issues and 22% of those reported that they did not take the first step to receiving care because they were afraid of how others around them would react to the information, it has become clear that societal pressures do more than just ascribe certain roles to individuals; they erode the struggles that individuals confront. This paper explores three empirical ways in which the pressure to persevere corrodes mental health: suppressing vulnerability, lowering self-esteem, and placing an importance on an individual's role in society over their well-being. In a society that values individual freedom over community, the mindset of isolating an individual from their community and support system through placing an extreme amount of external pressure can be particularly dangerous. Indeed, this issue is only exemplified when society forces citizens to 'tough out' their mental battles, encouraging them to rebound through their ambition instead of supplying them with the proper resources and help that they need."}}

We use network analysis and ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions to model the relationship between log-transformed TOT, harmonic mean depth (HMD) and betweenness (BETW). HMD captures the accessibility of spaces in their neighborhoods. BETW measures the extent spaces are on the shortest paths between other space-pairs. HMD is significantly correlated with TOT, controlling for surgical complexity, case order and surgical specialty, and is 2.63 times (absolute β) more influential than BETW, which is not significantly associated with TOT.

Traditional deterministic planning methods are proving inadequate, prompting a shift toward adaptive, flexibility-based approaches. This paper presents an innovative software architecture to evaluate the role of local flexibility in mitigating congestion and optimizing grid operations. The framework integrates a stochastic scenario generator and an enhanced Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm to quantify flexibility contributions in urban and rural networks. By applying Monte Carlo simulations, the platform captures uncertainties in load and generation growth, offering a probabilistic approach to grid planning.Two flexibility strategies—“desired power exchange” and “zero power exchange”—are assessed for their effectiveness in deferring grid reinforcements and improving operational stability. Simulation results indicate that local flexibility can sufficiently address congestion in future scenarios. The modular design of the platform ensures adaptability to various simulation requirements and network conditions. However, challenges such as OPF convergence and computational efficiency persist, particularly in highly congested contexts.Future research will focus on enhancing optimization methodologies, incorporating voltage compensation mechanisms, and exploring advanced techniques like Genetic Algorithm-based OPF models. The approach aligns with European regulatory directives supporting transparency and efficiency in grid planning. By enabling decentralized and responsive grid management, the proposed architecture offers a scalable and valuable tool for Distribution System Operators (DSOs), supporting the development of sustainable, resilient power distribution networks."}}

The findings reveal that management accountants are increasingly adopting hybrid roles, acting as translators between financial and sustainability logics and developing new competencies in digitalization and cross-boundary collaboration. Jurisdictional boundaries are shown to be fluid and contested, shaped by both internal adaptation and external interventions. The study demonstrates that professional transformation is neither linear nor uniform, but is characterized by negotiation, ambiguity, and ongoing contestation.

Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive three-layer methodology aimed at maximizing the potential of smart prosumers, particularly energy hubs and internet data centers, in delivering network services. In the first layer, energy storage-rich energy hubs and internet data centers determine their maximum available downward capacities in a decentralized manner and submit these to distribution-level congestion management markets. The second layer involves Distribution System Operators (DSOs) independently settling their local congestion management markets and offering the remaining downstream capacities to the upstream transmission-level congestion management market. In the third layer, the Transmission System Operator (TSO) settles transmission-level congestion management market, incorporating the downward capacities received from distribution systems. The proposed method is applied to a system, comprising a 14-bus transmission system coupled with eight 15-bus distribution systems, using GAMS for implementation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology successfully releases the maximum available downward capacities of energy hubs and internet data centers in both transmission and distribution-level congestion management markets.

The main objective consists of minimizing trip cancellations and deviations from the original plan, while fulfilling locomotives&apos; availability and maintenance constraints. The studied LResP features severe disruptions lasting more than one day and a weekly rescheduling horizon.   To solve LResP, we adapt a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation originally proposed in the literature for the planning problem by including a new objective function and additional constraints required for the rescheduling setting. Although good quality solutions for small-scale instances are obtained by solving the MILP model with a general-purpose solver, to tackle larger-scale instances with additional real-life constraints in short computing times, we design a Multi-Neighborhood Search metaheuristic (MNS). It effectively combines both traditional and problem-tailored neighborhoods. In addition, it relies on stochastic exploration and uses a simulated annealing scheme to guide the search. We tested the proposed approaches on instances from a real-world setting of the Austrian railways. While the MILP model obtains a few optimal solutions for small-scale instances, MNS demonstrates both fast and scalable, obtaining good quality solutions on instances with thousands trips, thus highlighting its reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios."}}

This study investigates machine learning surrogate models for predicting Hertzian contact stress in involute gear pairs, aiming to accelerate the gear design process. Unlike approaches based on finite element simulations or experimental data, the proposed method relies solely on stress values from ISO 6336 formulations. A comprehensive dataset covering various macro geometries and loading conditions is used to train and evaluate several regression models, including Elastic Net, Support Vector Regressor, ensemble methods, and Neural Networks. To improve computational efficiency and address the high dimensionality of the input space, Principal Component Analysis is explored as a dimensionality reduction technique. The study provides a detailed comparison of surrogate modeling approaches based on predictive accuracy and generalization. Results show that surrogate models can accurately reproduce ISO based predictions, offering a faster alternative to traditional methods. Focusing on Hertzian stress, rather than root stress, offers deeper insight into surface fatigue and pitting resistance for gear life improvement. This work establishes the foundation for future surrogate models that optimize gear pairs by balancing multiple design objectives and constraints, aiding engineers in selecting optimal configurations."}}

In the automotive industry, the safety of intended functionallity (SOTIF) is a common industry standard. In practice, providing a proof of SOTIF based solely on real-world tests is often economically unfeasible. This has lead to an increasing demand for simulation-based testing methods. Switching from real-world to simulative testing, the simulation model’s credibility is of utmost importance within the entire simulation domain. A key question here arises: How do we chose a (small) number of physical samples to validate our simulation model that covers a maximum of the (parameter) domain?The authors propose a sample definition algorithm grounded in system theory to maximize representativeness of this (small) number of prototypes, while minimizing prototype count. This facilitates efficient validation, addressing practical constraints in prototype testing, such as cost and time, thus enhancing model credibility and robustness across automotive and aerospace sectors. The paper demonstrates the applicability of this framework through academic and industrial case studies, establishing a systematic path towards credible simulation."}}

This lack of investigation is unexpected, considering that trust in subordinates is a hallmark of LFL, which is essential for fostering cooperative relationships that involve problem-solving. Additionally, in contrast to non-family businesses (NFBs), the socioemotional wealth that influences decision-making in family businesses (FBs) should render LFL, along with trust in subordinates and the application of problem-solving, more prevalent in the latter. In this research, we examine the implementation of LFL in FBs compared to NFBs and investigate whether trust in subordinates underpins a positive correlation between LFL and the utilization of this approach, as well as whether the unique socioemotional wealth of FBs accounts for variations in this relationship. Utilizing a sample of 326 general managers from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Ecuador, two complementary methodologies partial least squares (PLS) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA) produced robust results. As anticipated, variations in the intensity of this relationship were observed between FBs and NFBs, with LFL and both affective and cognitive trust being pivotal for the implementation of problem-solving in FBs, whereas cognitive trust assumed this primary role in NFBs. Our results bridge the largely distinct literature on leadership and conflict management within the context of FBs."}}
