They admitted the complexity of human nature and society as they really are and recognized that we would not progress economically suppressing the market, just as we would not do so morally in a fantastic universe without sins.

Constant full monitoring of the conditions for carrying out agricultural processes, the dynamics of changes in the state of agricultural lands, and the characteristics of technological processes using technical means for real-time monitoring is the most important prerequisite for the implementation of highly productive and effective agricultural technologies. The expert method of hierarchical analysis can be used to substantiate groups of factors and the system of food security indicators. Based on the obtained system of indicators, the structure, relationships, and membership functions of fuzzy cognitive maps are formed. For parameterization of cognitive maps, the construction of infological and information models is used, providing justification for the structure of the relational database for the analyzed statistical indicators. We have constructed and tested a family of predictive econometric models based on private indicators for food product groups. Methods for integrating the obtained econometric models into a cognitive map have been developed based on membership functions and fuzzy logic. To support numerical studies and scenario analyses, the methodology of developed cognitive maps is used, a software complex is required.

This study investigates the extent to which climate anomalies, particularly temperature and oil price shocks, influence food price dynamics in West Africa. Employing Dynamic Panel Analysis on a panel dataset of 16 West African countries from 1983 to 2023. The analysis reveals that temperature anomalies have a statistically significant and positive effect on food inflation, with stronger effects observed in Sahelian economies compared to Coastal counterparts. The findings underscore the vulnerability of food systems to climatic variability, particularly in rain-fed agricultural zones. Oil price fluctuations, a proxy for input and transport costs, also contribute significantly to inflationary pressures. Robustness checks using static panel models reaffirm the central role of climate-induced shocks in driving food price volatility.

For the class of Bayesian frequency-domain OMA, the initial step before the actual modal identification is the mode-picking process which involves the determination of a resonant frequency band and the number of the dominating modes therein. However, the mode-picking process in conventional Bayesian frequency-domain OMA is usually operated manually, leading to the issue of subjectiveness and another source of uncertainty. In this study, the mode-picking process is automated based on the property of modal invariant subspace inherent in the power spectral density (PSD) of ambient vibration data within a resonant frequency band. Modal correlation matrix between the subspaces of the estimated PSD at different frequency points is further constructed for the purpose of extracting the resonant frequency band and determining the number of dominating modes therein. The automation of the mode-picking process is specifically achieved by converting the modal correlation matrix into a binary matrix and then adopting the mathematical morphology operation and the Moore-Neighbor tracing algorithm. The proposed method is demonstrated with a simulated 4-DOF mass-spring-damper structure, a 3-story laboratory shear-frame structure and a practical bell tower engineering structure.

It revealed a linear correlation (R\u00b2 = 0.95) between water absorption time and the height position of the extremum point in the temperature gradient. Utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology, volumetric water content profiles at different times and heights were normalized against the benchmark value at vacuum-saturated state, generating normalized water saturation profiles. A linear relationship (R\u00b2 = 0.91) was also found between water absorption time and the height position of the extremum point in the rate of change of the normalized water saturation profile. A novel linear correlation model (R\u00b2 = 0.98) was established between the temperature gradient extremum point and the extremum point in the rate of change of the normalized water saturation profile. Based on in-situ temperature data acquired via infrared thermography (IRT), the extremum point of the water saturation profile can be accurately inferred.\u00a0Furthermore, a neural network prediction model was proposed to reconstruct the water content distribution at arbitrary times and different height positions using discrete water content data from limited time points. Model predictions showed excellent agreement with NMR results (average error <5%, maximum error <15%).

Such indemnification for, or recovery of, the corporate fine reduces the economic burden on the undertaking and therefore conflicts with the principle of effectiveness under EU law, which requires fines on the undertaking not only to be proportionate but also dissuasive and deterrent. Proponents of indemnification and recovery argue that the reduction of deterrence on the company is compensated by the increase in deterrence on individuals. This article explains that this is not the case, inter alia, because of the presence of D&amp;O insurance. In the case before the referring court, if recovery of the corporate fine were allowed, the D&amp;O insurer would pay the entirety of the corporate fine and likely all third-party damages, possibly even allowing the company to retain the cartel profits; the D&amp;O insurer's liability has already been determined by a final court judgment, and the coverage limits far exceed the corporate fine and likely third-party damages claims. Accordingly, neither the company nor the manager would bear any economic burden for their intentional cartel participation, a result that clearly contradicts the principle of effectiveness.</span>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fb7\u56fd\u8054\u90a6\u6cd5\u9662\u5411\u6b27\u76df\u6cd5\u9662\u63d0\u51fa\u521d\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be2\u95ee\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5411\u6709\u8fc7\u9519\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7d22\u8d54\u56e0\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u516c\u53f8\u5904\u4ee5\u7684\u7f5a\u6b3e\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7d22\u8d54\u6216\u8ffd\u507f\u4f1a\u51cf\u8f7b\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b27\u76df\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u539f\u5219\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u652f\u6301\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u5a01\u6151\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u5bf9\u516c\u53f8\u5a01\u6151\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u7531\u4e8e\u8463\u4e8b\u8d23\u4efb\u4fdd\u9669\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8865\u507f\u5e76\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "research_question": "\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5411\u6709\u8fc7\u9519\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7d22\u8d54\u56e0\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u516c\u53f8\u5904\u4ee5\u7684\u7f5a\u6b3e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7d22\u8d54\u6216\u8ffd\u507f\u516c\u53f8\u7f5a\u6b3e\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6027\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6b27\u76df\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u539f\u5219\uff08\u7f5a\u6b3e\u9700\u5177\u6709\u5a01\u6151\u6027\u548c\u529d\u963b\u6027\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8463\u4e8b\u8d23\u4efb\u4fdd\u9669\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u7d22\u8d54\u6216\u8ffd\u507f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u7ecf\u7406\u65e0\u9700\u627f\u62c5\u4efb\u4f55\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u8fdd\u80cc\u6709\u6548\u6027\u539f\u5219\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8463\u4e8b\u8d23\u4efb\u4fdd\u9669\u5728\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u7f5a\u6b3e\u8ffd\u507f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7acb\u6cd5\u548c\u53f8\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u7f5a\u6b3e\u8ffd\u507f\u7684\u8b66\u793a\u3002"}}

While Professor Laurence Helfer, in his seminal article published in 2008, identified the ECtHR as an emerging innovation frontier in Europe, the extent to which this prediction has come to fruition might seem debatable. Notably, the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), rather than that of the ECtHR, has largely dominated discussions on the intersection of IP and human rights in Europe. As such, this article seeks to analyse the ECtHR\u2019s contribution to \u2013 and its actual impact on \u2013 the human rights-based adjudication of IP issues. After a short introduction (I), it begins by examining the possible reasons behind the relative obscurity of ECtHR decisions in the European IP law discourse (II). It then focuses on the Strasbourg Court\u2019s contribution to the development of human rights-based IP adjudication, demonstrating that, despite the limited engagement of IP community with the ECtHR, its jurisprudence has played, and continues to play, a pivotal role in shaping European IP law norms (III). This influence is assessed by first exploring the ECtHR-developed approaches to resolving conflicts between IP protection and freedom of expression (III.1), followed by an examination of the Court\u2019s recognition of IP rights as an integral part of the broader human right to property \u2013 an area that has seen considerable expansion, particularly in recent years (III.2). Based on this analysis, the article concludes that we are certainly not waiting anymore for the ECtHR to become a new innovation frontier \u2013 it has already become one, having formed itself as a significant, albeit often underappreciated, force in the European IP legal landscape, operating quietly but far more meaningfully than is commonly recognised (IV).</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u4eba\u6743\u6cd5\u9662\uff08ECtHR\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1Laurence Helfer\u6559\u6388\u57282008\u5e74\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4bECtHR\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86ECtHR\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u6743\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u88c1\u51b3\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6cd5\u5f8b\u683c\u5c40\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u529b\u91cf\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u6d32\u4eba\u6743\u6cd5\u9662\uff08ECtHR\uff09\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u6743\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u88c1\u51b3\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1ECtHR\u7684\u5224\u4f8b\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6cd5\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4e0e\u4eba\u6743\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u503c\u5f97\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u6743\u6cd5\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8ECtHR\u7684\u5224\u4f8b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6b27\u6d32\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790ECtHR\u7684\u5224\u4f8b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u51b2\u7a81\u4e2d\u7684\u88c1\u51b3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u89c6\u4e3a\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "ECtHR\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6cd5\u5f8b\u683c\u5c40\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5e38\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u672c\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4eba\u6743\u6cd5\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6cd5\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86ECtHR\u5224\u4f8b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9ECtHR\u5224\u4f8b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4eba\u6743\u6cd5\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

This paper presents an automated system that integrates Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical data through a cloud-aware selection mechanism that identifies the most appropriate imagery source based on prevailing atmospheric conditions. A custom CloudAnalyzer module computes quality scores for each satellite dataset by weighting factors such as cloud cover, data availability, and temporal proximity, defaulting to SAR when optical data is obstructed. The selected imagery is processed using pre-trained models Microsoft AI4Flood, IBM Prithvi, or an ensemble without additional fine-tuning. Model selection is adaptive: Sentinel-2 paired with Prithvi is used under clear skies, while high cloud presence triggers a switch to Sentinel-1 with AI4Flood. A large language model enables natural language interaction by referencing detection outputs, cloud assessments, and real-time environmental data. To improve reliability, system outputs are validated against rainfall measurements, current weather alerts, and historical flood records.

Its frameworks and guidelines offer a shared foundation for transparency, accountability, and integrity in the management of public resources\u2014key pillars in anti-corruption strategies. The results presented in this section are based on a combination of content analysis of official INTOSAI documents and qualitative data gathered through expert interviews with auditors and public governance specialists.The article concludes that this initiative is a step in the right direction but critically evaluates it. Despite INTOSAI\u2019s significant global reach and potential for impact, the proposed audit criteria are developed contrary to basic audit theory.

This study developed a material flow model to evaluate future scenarios impacting battery waste volumes and recovery potential from cathode material on an annual basis to 2050. The modelling suggests annual waste volumes of spent lithium-ion batteries from EVs could range between 500,000 and 900,000 tonnes by 2050 depending on EV market projection trajectories. Our analysis shows how future changes in battery chemistry, size, expected lifetimes, and recycling efficiency can significantly affect the potential value of recovered materials. One of the most significant variables is recycling efficiency has the potential to increase the total mass of recovered materials by 205.5%.

How would the environmental footprints of production and consumption change? Future-oriented life cycle assessment (LCA) seeks to answer this question by evaluating the environmental impacts of technologies under prospective conditions. However, available life cycle inventory databases (LCI-DBs) are reflecting contemporary conditions, and existing tools for modeling large-scale supply chain transformations lack versatility and transparency. To address this gap, we introduce \"fossilfree_ecoinvent\", a parametric and open-source tool for generating customized, partially or fully defossilized, versions of ecoinvent for future-oriented LCAs. The model systematically replaces fossil-based energy and material flows in electricity, heat, transport, and other sectors with alternatives, including renewable technologies, synthetic fuels, and electrified systems. We benchmark the resulting fossil-free LCI-DB against other databases that reflect defossilized scenarios, assess potential environmental trade-offs, and demonstrate its application through a case study on providing decent living standards."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cfossilfree_ecoinvent\u201d\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u5316\u77f3\u5316\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6e05\u5355\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u5316\u77f3\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8db3\u8ff9\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6e05\u5355\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u5f53\u524d\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672a\u6765\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u201cfossilfree_ecoinvent\u201d\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u66ff\u6362\u5316\u77f3\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6d41\u4e3a\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u5408\u6210\u71c3\u6599\u548c\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "findings": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u53bb\u5316\u77f3\u5316\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6743\u8861\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5bfc\u5411LCA\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u53bb\u5316\u77f3\u5316\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We identify persistent overacquisition of information and an overall similar pattern of precision choices in both individual and strategic decision environments. In contrast, we find substantial overuse of private information in the strategic, but not in the individual decision setup. Moreover, we find that the overuse bias in the strategic environment is stronger in subjects who overacquire information and this relationship between biases cannot be explained by sunk-cost fallacies or popular models of bounded rationality. By disentangling forces related to the strategic environment, we argue that the overuse of information is driven by factors related to strategic belief formation and tensions in the information structure. We show that the overuse bias has negligible welfare effects, while overacquisition leads to significant welfare losses."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u798f\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u6218\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6218\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2a\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "findings": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u83b7\u53d6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u83b7\u53d6\u8005\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u798f\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0a\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u83b7\u53d6\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u798f\u5229\u635f\u5931\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6c89\u6ca1\u6210\u672c\u8c2c\u8bef\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5e72\u9884\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Accordingly, we outline three complementary avenues through which L-A-P can enrich crisis leadership research: by (1) enhancing understanding of the dynamic interplay between routines and improvisation, (2) exploring the intersections of leadership and learning during crisis; and (3) capturing collective forms of leadership that emerge under crisis conditions.

A key feature of NFTs is the inclusion of royalties, which grant creators a share of all future resale proceeds. Although widely used, critics argue that sophisticated speculators, which dominate the NFT market, simply price in royalties upfront, neutralizing their impact. We show this intuition to be true only under the assumption of perfect frictionless markets. Under more realistic market conditions, royalties enable creators to capitalize on the presence of speculators in at least three ways: They can enable risk sharing (under risk aversion), mitigate information asymmetry (when speculators are better informed) and unlock price discrimination benefits (in multi-unit settings).

Using nine years of transaction data, we show that such events boost the revenue of stores inside the mall by up to 18.7 or 38.9 days of sales. Intertemporal substitutions can only partly explain the effect. We also show that the sales increases are driven by not only more foot traffic but also higher consumer spending during festivals. Nor are consumers only attracted by luxury brand promotions, as nonluxury brands also experience similar sales increases. Focusing on two main marketing activities during festivals, we find that while there is no clear evidence that store-specific promotions benefit participating stores, conditional promotions, a unique marketing activity planned and organized by the mall, can further boost sales and consumer spending for participating stores. The effectiveness, however, may rely on the participation rate of retailers and the design of the promotion. Finally, shopping festivals can effectively attract not only active but also inactive and new customers. These customers are associated with higher future spending, contributing to the long-term benefit of the mall.&nbsp;"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8d2d\u7269\u8282\u5bf9\u5546\u573a\u5185\u5e97\u94fa\u6536\u5165\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe18.7\u621638.9\u5929\u7684\u9500\u552e\u989d\u3002\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6765\u81ea\u5ba2\u6d41\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd8\u6e90\u4e8e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u652f\u51fa\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u975e\u5962\u4f88\u54c1\u724c\u540c\u6837\u53d7\u76ca\u3002\u5546\u573a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4fc3\u9500\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u548c\u4fc3\u9500\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u8d2d\u7269\u8282\u8fd8\u80fd\u5438\u5f15\u65b0\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u957f\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "research_question": "\u8d2d\u7269\u8282\u5bf9\u5546\u573a\u5185\u5e97\u94fa\u6536\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8d2d\u7269\u8282\u8fd9\u7c7b\u77ed\u671f\u4fc3\u9500\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u5546\u573a\u5185\u5e97\u94fa\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fc3\u9500\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u8de8\u671f\u66ff\u4ee3\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u54c1\u724c\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u4fc3\u9500\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e5d\u5e74\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u8d2d\u7269\u8282\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e97\u94fa\u6536\u5165\uff08\u6700\u9ad838.9\u5929\u9500\u552e\u989d\uff09\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u6765\u81ea\u5ba2\u6d41\u548c\u652f\u51fa\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u975e\u5962\u4f88\u54c1\u724c\u540c\u6837\u53d7\u76ca\uff1b\u6761\u4ef6\u4fc3\u9500\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u9500\u552e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d2d\u7269\u8282\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u4fc3\u9500\u6d3b\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5546\u573a\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fc3\u9500\u6d3b\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u4f18\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4fc3\u9500\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u3002"}}

This work examines a quiet but consequential shift in U.S. data privacy law: the legal recognition of&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms (UOOMs) for consumers to delegate some privacy choices to simple software tools. Though technically straightforward, these tools are legally innovative, enabling consumers to exercise new statutory rights to opt out of data sales at scale. What\u2019s more, new UOOM statutes may already be taking an expected twist: the language of these statutes appears broad enough to encompass emerging consumer-side AI agents, suggesting that state data privacy law may have inadvertently laid the groundwork for an emerging AI governance regime.<br><br>But will consumers use these tools? Previous empirical studies have generally painted a bleak picture for privacy protections, suggesting that consumers are apathetic, confused, or overwhelmed when it comes to privacy affordances, legal or technical. Further work has shown the substantial capacity for firms to discourage consumer use of privacy self-advocacy. Blending legal rights and technical mechanisms, UOOMS seem unlikely to fare any better than previous consumer privacy initiatives. We conducted an online experiment to understand whether consumers are willing to adopt UOOMs, and what obstacles they may face if they do so. We hypothesized that both technical obstacles (difficulty of installation) and institutional friction (dark patterns) would render both UOOM uptake and retention rates low, but our results were surprising, and indeed joyful. Nearly 80% of participants installed an UOOM, and most continued using it a week later. These high rates held across demographic and geographic divides, suggesting that UOOMs can serve a broad population.&nbsp;<br><br>UOOMs may be a rare convergence of usability, legal legitimacy, and consumer demand, but their future relevance is far from assured. Currently, few firms comply with UOOM requests, and state regulators appear inactive despite the ease of auditing for compliance. But providing consumers with autonomy as to their privacy has taken on a particular significance under a federal regime that increasingly relies on data purchases to circumvent traditional civil liberties protections. We therefore close in suggesting potential reforms to existing UOOM statutes, arguing in favor of mandating expanded availability and recognition of these tools as well as broadening their scope to other privacy statutory rights and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u91cd\u8981\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff08UOOMs\uff09\u59d4\u6258\u9690\u79c1\u9009\u62e9\u6743\u7ed9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6280\u672f\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u521b\u65b0\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u9500\u552e\u9009\u62e9\u9000\u51fa\u6743\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9UOOMs\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u51fa\u4e4e\u610f\u6599\u5730\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6765\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u9769\u4ee5\u6269\u5927\u5176\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff08UOOMs\uff09\uff1f\u4ed6\u4eec\u9762\u4e34\u54ea\u4e9b\u969c\u788d\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76UOOMs\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8ba4\u53ef\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9UOOMs\u7684\u5b89\u88c5\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "findings": "\u8fd180%\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5b89\u88c5\u4e86UOOMs\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6301\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u5468\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u6539\u9769UOOMs\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u5176\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u9690\u79c1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u3002"}}

This paper proposes an extension to the original framework with goodwill stock simultaneously augmenting demand and reducing capital and labour costs. Embedding these effects in a Cobb-Douglas format yields a tractable profit function and an infinite-horizon optimal-control problem which collapses to a single-state HJB equation. This augmentation serves to better model the real-world dynamics of corporate advertising in the salient media, meme-driven, and reflexively validated environments common to developed markets, primarily those of the United States."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Nerlove-Arrow\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5e7f\u544a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5546\u8a89\u5b58\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u5f71\u54cd\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u672c\u4e0e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5168\u7403\u5316\u3001\u5a92\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6269\u5c55Nerlove-Arrow\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u5546\u8a89\u5b58\u91cf\u5bf9\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u5a92\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eNerlove-Arrow\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5e7f\u544a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5546\u8a89\u5b58\u91cf\u5bf9\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728Cobb-Douglas\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u5229\u6da6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5355\u72b6\u6001HJB\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "findings": "\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5a92\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5e7f\u544a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6210\u672c\u6e20\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5316\u3001\u5a92\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5236\u5b9a\u5e7f\u544a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Owing to a unique copyright system, Brazilian firms have registered their software with the government since the 1980s, creating a detailed record of nearly all commercial AI applications developed in the country. Drawing on this registry, I show that AI is widely used not only in administrative tasks but also in production settings, where it primarily supports process optimization and quality control. Using an instrument based on variation in software development costs, I find that AI affects administrative and production workers differently. Among office workers, AI reduces employment and wages, particularly for middle-wage earners. Among production workers, it increases employment of low-skilled and young workers operating machinery. These results suggest that AI displaces routine office tasks while making machines more productive and easier to operate, leading to a net increase in employment.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5df4\u897f\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u8f6f\u4ef6\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u5728\u884c\u653f\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u4ea7\u5de5\u4eba\u5c31\u4e1a\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u5bf9\u5df4\u897f\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u5df4\u897f\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7248\u6743\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76AI\u5728\u884c\u653f\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u884c\u653f\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5df4\u897f\u653f\u5e9c\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6ce8\u518c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "AI\u5728\u884c\u653f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e2d\u7b49\u6536\u5165\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4f4e\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u5e74\u8f7b\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u66ff\u4ee3\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86AI\u5bf9\u5c31\u4e1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Although individual improvement is predicted in delay or collision cost, their coupled outcome is not measured at an RBI. A tradeoff on the benefits further intensifies this question. Motivated by explaining their complicated or harmonized relationship, we make hypotheses and test them using the Pareto Frontier and regression analyses. We formulate a bi-objective optimization model on a simulation-optimizationin-the-loop (SOIL) framework, which provides a fundamental ground for controlled experiments. We observe the tradeoff between delay and expected collision costs on the frontier. We further compare the estimation between fixed effects and pooling Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models and find that the tradeoff exists regardless of exogenous experiment settings at an RBI involving CAVs. This result also aligns with a theoretical finding on topology for a queueing server system. We believe that this socioeconomic tradeoff analysis highly contributes to policymaking on prioritized social welfare in this competitive CAV industry at an RBI."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u7ea6\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\uff08RBI\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08CAVs\uff09\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u7ea6\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\uff08RBI\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08CAVs\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1CAVs\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u78b0\u649e\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e2a\u4f53\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5728RBI\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u961f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff08SOIL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u666e\u901a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08OLS\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9884\u671f\u78b0\u649e\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u53d7RBI\u4e2d\u5916\u751f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6392\u961f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9CAVs\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aRBI\u4e2dCAVs\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002"}}

However, what has been observed is that law school deans are faced with a myriad jobs and duties, which include overseeing an administrative apparatus that (1) coordinates scores of courses each semester; (2) manages faculty and faculty committees; (3) oversees clinical, externship, pro bono, and public interest programs; (4) supports hundreds of students, individually and through student organizations; (5) maintains connections with alumni; (6) engages with central administration; and (7) fundraises. The diversity of tasks deals with areas of \"student matters, staff matters, strategic planning, budget, external relations, fundraising, 'bushfires' and other crises, university-wide matters, discipline-wide matters, and these are apart from any residual scholarly or teaching ambitions.\"&nbsp; Therefore, one of the challenges faced by deans is that they must prioritize numerous individual duties to ensure they address the most important matters first. Beyond these duties, there are also numerous, more tedious tasks and complications. Law school deans, directly or indirectly, must&nbsp; (1) ensure that staff vacation and sick days are not abused; (2) navigate the political realities of tensions between law school employees; (3) work most weekends; and (4) endure being bogged down by meetings. These tasks, although not enjoyable, are crucial responsibilities that law school deans must undertake in addition to their regular duties. In short, they must trade \u201ca comfortable life of teaching, scholarship, and minimal administrative responsibility for a life of administrative drudgery, very little teaching, and virtually no time for scholarship.\u201d This Article utilizes empirical, theoretical, and practical perspectives to explore what law school deans should know to effectively leverage the human capital of law faculties in advancing the needs of law schools and their constituencies.</p>\n </div>\n <div>\n </div>\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u957f\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u804c\u8d23\u548c\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u884c\u653f\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5b66\u751f\u652f\u6301\u3001\u6821\u53cb\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u7b79\u6b3e\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6559\u804c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u957f\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6559\u804c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u53ca\u5176\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u957f\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u804c\u8d23\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u957f\u7684\u804c\u8d23\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u8bc1\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u957f\u9700\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u804c\u8d23\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u7e41\u7410\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u957f\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u957f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5176\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c65\u884c\u804c\u8d23\u3002"}}

Accordingly, as global investors increasingly adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, firms in these programs may enhance their corporate responsibility and their commitment to addressing grand challenges. We challenge this literature by explaining why this effect of stock market liberalization programs should not be taken for granted, especially in emerging markets and contribute to the field by showing that institutional factors moderate this relationship. Using China\u2019s stock market liberalization programs as natural experiments that quasi-exogenously connect emerging-market firms to global investors, we find that emerging-market firms in stock liberalization programs reduce their disclosure of supplier identity information, an important step in tackling environmental grand challenges. However, when emerging-market firms have certain characteristics, such as a large proportion of committed foreign ownership, global environmental certifications, and top leadership with overseas experience, the negative effect is diminished and even reversed as the balance between the long-term upsides and short-term downsides of voluntary supplier disclosure shifts."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u80a1\u5e02\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f1a\u9762\u4e34\u5168\u7403\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u8de8\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u5bf9\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5236\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u4f1a\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u56fd\u80a1\u5e02\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u5916\u8d44\u6301\u80a1\u3001\u5168\u7403\u73af\u4fdd\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u9ad8\u7ba1\u6d77\u5916\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff09\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u751a\u81f3\u9006\u8f6c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "research_question": "\u80a1\u5e02\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u73af\u5883\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\uff08ESG\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u80a1\u5e02\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u4f1a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1aESG\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u8d28\u7591\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5236\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5236\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548cESG\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u56fd\u80a1\u5e02\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u5916\u751f\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "findings": "\u80a1\u5e02\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f01\u4e1a\u51cf\u5c11\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u5916\u8d44\u6301\u80a1\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9ad8\u3001\u62e5\u6709\u5168\u7403\u73af\u4fdd\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6216\u9ad8\u7ba1\u6709\u6d77\u5916\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u6216\u9006\u8f6c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5236\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u80a1\u5e02\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u4e0eESG\u8868\u73b0\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316ESG\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002"}}

After applying stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, 100 relevant studies were selected for analysis. The review synthesized empirical and theoretical findings, focusing on the effectiveness of CSR initiatives and their alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Results: The findings reveal that while CSR initiatives significantly contribute to addressing global challenges, there are critical gaps in their longterm sustainability and effectiveness, particularly in developing regions. The review highlights the importance of integrating stakeholder engagement, addressing systemic inequalities, and measuring the impact of CSR practices to enhance their effectiveness. <b>Contributions: </b>This study provides valuable insights into the role of CSR in fostering sustainable development, contributing to existing theories and offering practical applications for industry and policymakers.

The system leverages proprietary nanomaterial-based detection matrices integrated with advanced metaloxide semiconductor sensor arrays and machine learning algorithms to achieve unprecedented analytical precision in complex subsurface environments. Executed over a 14-week validation campaign across tectonically active ophiolite complexes and granitic basement formations, the deployment architecture employed a radial well configuration with central injection at 100-meter depth and peripheral capture arrays at 70-meter depth, encompassing interrogation volumes of approximately 20,000 m\u00b2 per configuration. The nanomaterial platform incorporates engineered nanoparticles (10-30 nm) with tailored surface chemistry exhibiting selective affinity for target analytes through chemisorption mechanisms, achieving detection sensitivities spanning low-yield radiolytic outputs (tens of ppm) to high-concentration serpentinization regimes (thousands of ppm). Multi-modal detection capabilities integrate Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering with femtomolar sensitivity (10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 M), fluorescence spectroscopy, and electrochemical transduction to provide orthogonal validation of analytical measurements. Artificial intelligence algorithms process sensor telemetry through neural network architectures trained on synthetic datasets, executing realtime three-dimensional pathway reconstruction and volumetric resource estimation via geostatistical interpolation with Monte Carlo uncertainty quantification. Empirical results demonstrate exceptional performance metrics including 92% detection efficacy across variable lithological settings, cost reduction of 95-98% relative to conventional drilling programs, and deployment cycle compression from 6-18 months to 1-2 weeks. The system successfully quantified hydrogen concentrations from trace radiolytic signatures to elevated hydrothermal yields while maintaining measurement precision within \u00b15% variance across environmental gradients encompassing tropical humidity conditions (80-95%), temperature fluctuations (24-32\u00b0C), and high precipitation regimes (&gt;2,500 mm annually). Resource quantification delineated 5-10 million m\u00b3 hydrogen accumulations with concomitant helium signatures, validated through independent geochemical correlation analysis achieving 95-98% accuracy. Environmental performance exceeded regulatory standards through zero-incident operations, minimal surface disturbance (&lt;0.1% footprint compared to conventional methods), and biodegradable nanomaterial formulations ensuring complete environmental breakdown within predetermined degradation pathways. The platform's resilience to aqueous saturation conditions enables operation in waterlogged tropical terrains where conventional surface expression methods demonstrate limited effectiveness. This technological advancement establishes new paradigms for sustainable exploration of clean energy resources, providing scalable solutions for accelerating natural hydrogen and helium discovery while maintaining superior"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86IRIS-X\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u5c3c\u897f\u4e9a\u897f\u82cf\u95e8\u7b54\u814aPadang\u5730\u533a\u86c7\u7eb9\u77f3\u5316\u548c\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u5730\u8d28\u6784\u9020\u4e2d\u5929\u7136\u6c22\u548c\u6c26\u8d44\u6e90\u5730\u4e0b\u52d8\u63a2\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u68c0\u6d4b\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9635\u5217\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5730\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "research_question": "IRIS-X\u5e73\u53f0\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5730\u63a2\u6d4b\u5929\u7136\u6c22\u548c\u6c26\u8d44\u6e90\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u94bb\u4e95\u52d8\u63a2\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5468\u671f\u957f\u4e14\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7834\u574f\u5927\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u73af\u4fdd\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u8868\u9762\u5316\u5b66\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5438\u9644\u673a\u5236\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f84\u5411\u4e95\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9635\u5217\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5730\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa92%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e95-98%\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u5468\u671f\u7f29\u77ed\u81f31-2\u5468\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6c22\u548c\u6c26\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u52d8\u63a2\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5929\u7136\u6c22\u548c\u6c26\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u52d8\u63a2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u73af\u4fdd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u52d8\u63a2\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Automation capabilities are evolving from manned control to full autonomy, and at each stage of this progression, the willingness to use each system is a predictor of adoption. This study investigates user willingness to use UAM for airport shuttle services across three levels of automation: manned control, remotely piloted, and fully autonomous. The study employed survey data from 1,613 respondents in South Korea. Using ordered logit models, we examine how socio-demographic and airport travel behaviour factors influence adoption. Results show that adoption patterns vary depending on the level of automation, and predictors of adoption also vary by level of automation. While current travel time to the airport and the primary purpose of airport use are prominent predictors of willingness to use UAM at the manned control level, demographic characteristics, particularly gender and age, become more significant as the level of automation increases.

Building on this overview, I then examine the effects of the Strategic Emerging Industries (SEI) initiative on green innovation through an event study with city-industry level patent data. I uncover two critical divergences: first, while targeted green sectors experienced explosive growth in innovation scale, equally prioritized non-green sectors gained only half as much.

By analyzing specific FIDIC clausessuch as Clause 14.7 (interim payments), Clause 20 (claims and disputes), and Clause 4.2 (performance securities)-this paper demonstrates how fintech tools can evolve into contract-aware systems.

It examines how the digital era, characterized by real-time connectivity, data-driven personalization, and platform-based ecosystems, is reshaping traditional marketing practices and strategic frameworks. The chapter begins by analyzing the evolution of digital marketing within a globalized context, focusing on the tension between standardization and local adaptation, and the strategic role of real-time engagement, analytics, and omnichannel customer relationships. It then investigates how digital technologies enable new international market entry models-relational, digital, and hybrid-lowering barriers to globalization while necessitating new capabilities in platform strategy, content localization, and cultural intelligence. In the B2B domain, digitalization is driving a shift from transactional models to value co-creation through predictive analytics, personalization at scale, and digital marketplaces. The final section identifies the core strategic capabilities firms must develop to thrive in a digitally connected world: robust digital infrastructure, AI-powered analytics, organizational agility, and global-local integration. Together, these insights offer a comprehensive framework for understanding how marketing strategies must evolve to remain competitive.

We build a game-theoretic model involving a supplier, a leading manufacturer with technology-upgrade potential, and a regular manufacturer reliant on the supplier for procurement. The model captures key contextual features, including downstream competition between manufacturers, the technology gap between traditional and advanced components, and market patriotism in the developing economy that favors locally produced components. We find that supply cut-off can paradoxically benefit the leading manufacturer by eliminating the supplier's strategic conciliation, thereby enabling the manufacturer to upgrade its technology in a less competitive downstream market. By contrast, the supplier is consistently worse off under a supply cut-off. We also identify a \"mid-tech dilemma\" for the leading manufacturer, where it faces the worst outcome when its technology upgrading capability lies at an intermediate level. Moreover, fiercer downstream competition, a larger technology gap, or lower market patriotism does not necessarily harm the leading manufacturer or benefit the supplier.

Traditional bundling theory, which usually assumes abundant inventory and static pricing settings, typically asserts that bundling generates higher revenue than selling products individually. However, we show that limited inventory, in fact, distorts the revenue extraction capability of bundling in favor of selling the products or services separately. We study the optimal dynamic mixed bundling strategy in a large market regime where the market size grows relative to limited inventory. Leveraging this framework, we derive optimal dynamic pricing policies and value functions for commonly used bundling strategies, including mixed bundling, pure bundling, bundle-size pricing, and component pricing. Our analysis reveals that as inventory becomes more constrained relative to market size, the most general dynamic mixed bundling strategy converges to a dynamic component pricing strategy, outperforming both dynamic bundle-size pricing and dynamic pure bundling. Moreover, the performance gap between these strategies increases with the number of items, a factor typically viewed as favoring bundling when inventory is abundant. Notably, our numerical experiments suggest that these insights also extend to the fluid-regime policies, revealing that as the market size increases relative to inventory, the dynamic mixed bundling strategy derived from the fluid regime mimics a dynamic component pricing strategy."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e93\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6346\u7ed1\u9500\u552e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6346\u7ed1\u9500\u552e\u603b\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e93\u5b58\u6709\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u6346\u7ed1\u9500\u552e\u7684\u6536\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u72ec\u9500\u552e\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "research_question": "\u5e93\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6346\u7ed1\u9500\u552e\u7b56\u7565\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6346\u7ed1\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u5e93\u5b58\u5145\u8db3\u4e14\u5b9a\u4ef7\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5e93\u5b58\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5b9a\u4ef7\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6346\u7ed1\u9500\u552e\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5e93\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5927\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5e93\u5b58\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u6346\u7ed1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5b9a\u4ef7\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "findings": "\u5e93\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u6346\u7ed1\u7b56\u7565\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6346\u7ed1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6346\u7ed1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e93\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u5e93\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Due to increasing concerns about waste generation, many e-tailers now resell returned items that have no quality issues as new. However, customers who receive these resold products may exhibit psychological discomfort and valuation discounts. In this study, we explore the interplay among the e-tailer's social awareness about waste generation, customers' uncertainty about product valuation in online shopping and their concerns about receiving returned items sold as new. We examine how they affect the e-tailer's adoption of reselling returns as new and the customers' purchasing and return decisions. Methodology/results: We develop a two-period game-theoretical model in which an e-tailer is concerned about waste generation, while customers exhibit valuation discounts about receiving returned products sold as new. In the first period, the e-tailer sells only brand new products. In the second period, the e-tailer resells returned products without quality issues as new alongside the brand new items. Our analysis shows that, compared with disposing of all returns, reselling eligible returns as new can lead to a \"win-win-win\" outcome for the e-tailer, customers, and the environment. However, educating customers about the sustainability benefits of reselling returns (which mitigates their concerns about receiving returned items) and urging e-tailers to prioritize waste reduction (which increases their environmental awareness) might inadvertently undermine this win-win-win outcome. Furthermore, under certain conditions, reselling returns can actually increase waste generation. Paradoxically, educating customers about the sustainability of reselling returns might even exacerbate the environmental impact. Managerial implications: Our research highlights the critical roles of the e-tailer's environmental concerns and customers' psychological valuation discount about receiving returned products in shaping the e-tailer's adoption of the strategies for reselling returns.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u4f46\u987e\u5ba2\u5bf9\u6b64\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5fc3\u7406\u4e0d\u9002\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u6298\u6263\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u5546\u3001\u987e\u5ba2\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u201c\u4e09\u8d62\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u987e\u5ba2\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u73af\u4fdd\u610f\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5916\u7834\u574f\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "research_question": "\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u73af\u4fdd\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u987e\u5ba2\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u8d2d\u7269\u4ea7\u54c1\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6536\u5230\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u7684\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5546\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee5\u53ca\u987e\u5ba2\u7684\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u9000\u8d27\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9000\u8d27\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6d6a\u8d39\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u5c1d\u8bd5\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u4f46\u987e\u5ba2\u5bf9\u6b64\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5fc3\u7406\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5546\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u5728\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u9500\u552e\u5168\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002", "findings": "\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u4e09\u8d62\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u987e\u5ba2\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u73af\u4fdd\u610f\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u589e\u52a0\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u5546\u73af\u4fdd\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u5fc3\u7406\u6298\u6263\u5728\u9000\u8d27\u4ea7\u54c1\u91cd\u65b0\u9500\u552e\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u73af\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u5fc3\u7406\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

This study applies for manufacturing companies where the performance of an employee can be measured by the numbers of product manufactured, the numbers of product inspected, the cycle time of an employee in performing specific tasks, and other concrete and measurable metrics. For illustration and example purposes, all data will be based on the researcher\u2019s subordinates. The researcher is a manufacturing quality engineer in a semiconductor company and handles thirty to thirty five quality assurance inspectors (QAI) whose purpose is to inspect outgoing products prior shipping to customers.&nbsp;</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u949f\u5f62\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u7ee9\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5b9a2\u03c3\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u524d2.1%\u548c\u540e2.1%\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u949f\u5f62\u66f2\u7ebf\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5458\u5de5\u7ee9\u6548\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u7ee9\u6548\u548c\u4f4e\u7ee9\u6548\u5458\u5de5\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u7ee9\u6548\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5458\u5de5\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u949f\u5f62\u66f2\u7ebf\uff08\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f2\u03c3\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u7ee9\u6548\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a2\u03c3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u7ee9\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u524d2.1%\u548c\u540e2.1%\u7684\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5177\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u949f\u5f62\u66f2\u7ebf\u5728\u7ee9\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7ee9\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

When addressing public administration, we must consider both \u201cimproving the means of government (reinventing, in this case) [and] addressing the ends of government\u201d (p. 333). NASA employees come from a diverse range of backgrounds, but they tend to share several qualities that contribute to successful missions. Organizational members' confidence in their team can lead to increased collaboration and improved performance (Rezvani et al., 2016, p. 1036). Leadership style is crucial in explaining an employee\u2019s level of job satisfaction and serves as a driver of the organization\u2019s goals and objectives (Jalagat, 2016, p. 38). Interdependence, or the inability of individuals and organizations to accomplish something independently, is a recognized precondition for collaborative action (Emerson et al., 2012). This research uses the 2020 FEVS Survey of NASA employees to examine the relationships and differences in empowerment, trust, motivation, and other factors, as well as their impact on interdependence and collaboration. Using SPSS Version 29, analyses were conducted using nonparametric statistical tests and ordinal logistic regression. Higher levels of motivation, integrity, and trust, as well as job satisfaction, among NASA employees led to increased collaboration within NASA. The current study found significant differences in interdependence based on the NASA employees\u2019 Hispanic status, age, and whether the person was a supervisor.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86NASA\u5458\u5de5\u4e2d\u8d4b\u80fd\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u8bda\u4fe1\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u6c34\u5e73\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "NASA\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u8d4b\u80fd\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u516c\u5171\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u9700\u521b\u9020\u521b\u65b0\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u800cNASA\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u4fe1\u4efb\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e2\u961f\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u9886\u5bfc\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982Emerson\u7b49\uff0c2012\uff09\u548c\u5458\u5de5\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\uff08Jalagat\uff0c2016\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282020\u5e74FEVS\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SPSS 29\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u5e8f\u6570\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u8bda\u4fe1\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u534f\u4f5c\uff1b\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u88d4\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7ba1\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3aNASA\u7b49\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5458\u5de5\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u52a0\u5f3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u5efa\u8bbe\u548c\u9886\u5bfc\u98ce\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

This approach replaces the current, crew base-level fairness mechanisms. In the new process, template-based rosters specify generic time windows, to which personalised duties are assigned in the operational phase. To evaluate the feasibility of the novel process, we develop a scalable simulation framework that accurately models the operational crew planning phase. The framework features a column generation heuristic to construct personalised duties, a network decomposition strategy to reduce computing times, and stochastically generated disruptions to simulate daily operations. Simulating the process for 3,265 guards throughout the year 2024, we find high conformance with the proposed individual Sharing-Sweet-and-Sour rules, with over 93% compliance for four out of six attributes.

However, accurate action recognition in complex and dynamic environments remains challenging due to challenges in multimodal fusion and semantic understanding. To address these challenges, a semantically-contrastive action recognition network (SCAR) is proposed, which enhances fine-grained modeling and discrimination of assembly actions. SCAR integrates structural motion information from skeleton sequences with semantic and contextual features extracted from RGB images, thereby improving comprehensive scene perception. Furthermore, task-relevant textual descriptions are introduced as semantic priors to guide cross-modal feature learning. A contrastive learning strategy is employed to reinforce semantic alignment and discriminability across modalities, facilitating the learning of task-aware representations. Evaluations on the benchmark action dataset NTU RGB+D and practical HRCA tasks demonstrate that SCAR significantly outperforms mainstream methods in recognition accuracy. The advantage is particularly evident in scenarios involving ambiguous operations and semantically similar assembly tasks. Ablation studies further validate the efficacy of the semantic guidance mechanism and contrastive learning strategy in enhancing modality complementarity and system robustness."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SCAR\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9aa8\u67b6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u548cRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u88c5\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u88c5\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SCAR\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9aa8\u67b6\u5e8f\u5217\u548cRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCAR\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u9aa8\u67b6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u548cRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "findings": "\u5728NTU RGB+D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645HRCA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSCAR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u88c5\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

The framework employs a neural network incorporating frequency-domain correlation and a delay-aware mechanism to model dynamic torque variations. Based on the predicted torque profiles, the robot\u2019s motion trajectory is parameterized by quintic polynomials, and a multiobjective loss function is constructed to jointly minimize execution time and torque variation rate.

This yields a change in the structural properties of timetables affecting capacity utilization and robustness on corridors. This paper analyzes the effects resulting from this new timetabling paradigm by assessing the effect of structural features of timetables on the capacity of rail corridors. Building on a heuristic timetable-ensemble generation approach, we study timetables with different structural properties. Timetable features quantifying service characteristics are defined and assessed with respect to their impact on timetable stability using Kendall\u2019s correlation and regression. Two important subclasses of timetables, periodic timetables with a regular repetitive train pattern and integrated (timed-transfer) timetables, are directly compared and evaluated. It is found that, for the ensemble of 3106 timetables, running time margins are the dominant aspect for stability on corridors, in particular when converting the timetable to timed-transfer timetables on an existing, not travel-time optimized infrastructure. The results suggest that, with the tendency towards more structured timetables, running time supplements rather than highly constrained buffer times should receive increased attention in capacity assessment and dimensioning of service concepts on rail corridors."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u94c1\u8def\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u5411\u4ee5\u4e58\u5ba2\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u94c1\u8def\u8d70\u5eca\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f59\u91cf\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u4ee5\u4e58\u5ba2\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\u523b\u8868\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u94c1\u8def\u8d70\u5eca\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6b27\u6d32\u94c1\u8def\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u6b63\u5728\u5411\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cKendall\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ca\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u96c6\u5408\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u6027\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u3002", "findings": "\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f59\u91cf\u662f\u94c1\u8def\u8d70\u5eca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b9a\u65f6\u6362\u4e58\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u65f6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f59\u91cf\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u94c1\u8def\u8d70\u5eca\u5bb9\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6982\u5ff5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f59\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7f13\u51b2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

Efficiently managing scarce and dynamic network resources to meet these demands remains a critical challenge, especially in complex and dense network environments. This paper addresses the problem of intelligent and adaptive resource allocation in 6G Intelligent Radio Access Networks (iRAN), focusing on optimizing task execution across multiple computing platforms. We propose a novel framework that dynamically selects among local gNodeB processing, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enabled task rerouting, and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) offloading to balance latency, reliability, and resource utilization. To effectively navigate the complexity of heterogeneous service classes and dynamic network states, our approach integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), enabling contextaware and service-aware decision-making. An analytical latency model supports the DRL agent by quantifying trade-offs across execution modes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed iRAN framework significantly improves latency performance and QoS compliance while ensuring scalable and energyefficient management of next-generation wireless networks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u53166G\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6027\u80fd\u548cQoS\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u57286G\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff1f", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5f02\u6784\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u672c\u5730\u5904\u7406\u3001SDN\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u548cMEC\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "findings": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6027\u80fd\u548cQoS\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Traditional path planning methods, which depend heavily on predefined templates and manual intervention, are inadequate for handling the spatial variability of weld seams and meeting the demands of multi-layer multi-pass welding (MLMPW). To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method for weld seam recognition and trajectory generation in MLMPW tasks based on point cloud perception. An improved PointPathNet architecture is developed, integrating channel attention and geometric enhancement mechanisms to enable automatic extraction of the weld seam region (WSR) from raw point clouds. Key feature points are then identified by combining surface normal variation with a weighted Harris3D algorithm. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to sort the key points, followed by B-spline fitting to model the welding path. Furthermore, the MLMPW trajectories are generated by analyzing geometric features of cross-sectional slices. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enables efficient pre-welding WSR recognition and adaptive MLMPW path generation, achieving a maximum trajectory error (ME) below 0.65 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) under 0.50 mm, with an average processing time of 684 ms.

Within VC firms, partners with broader backgrounds are more likely to lead novel, high-risk investments, which have a higher likelihood of breakthrough success or failure. On average, these partners do not outperform, but when leading novel deals, they significantly increase the chances of major success. These results are consistent with both selection, where broad-background partners are skilled at screening novel firms, and monitoring, where their involvement enhances novel firm performance. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in partner busyness as a shock to within VC firm likelihood of leading a deal, I provide causal evidence for these effects. To rationalize these findings and shed light on the stylized time trends observed in the data, I develop a model that jointly endogenizes novel startup creation by entrepreneurs, partner hiring by VC firms, and investment decisions.\n<br>\nThese results highlight the role of human capital breadth in financing novel projects."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\uff08VC\uff09\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u8d44\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9879\u76ee\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u5927\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9886\u5bfc\u65b0\u9896\u9879\u76ee\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "research_question": "\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u8d44\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u521b\u65b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3aVC\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u80cc\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u6295\u8d44\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u5fd9\u788c\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6570\u636e\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "findings": "\u80cc\u666f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9886\u5bfc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9879\u76ee\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3aVC\u516c\u53f8\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u62db\u8058\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u591a\u5143\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9879\u76ee\u3002"}}

We propose that democracy decentralizes decision-making authority and empowers local employees, thereby intensifying agency conflicts between MNE headquarters (HQs) and subsidiaries. To counterbalance the enhanced autonomy of local agents in democratic settings, MNEs deploy more expatriates as a governance mechanism to maintain HQ control. Using a comprehensive dataset of 18,147 foreign subsidiaries of South Korean MNEs across 58 countries, we find robust support for the positive relationship between host-country democracy and expatriate utilization. Furthermore, our moderation analysis reveals that this relationship is strengthened by labor representation and subsidiary involvement in the manufacturing sector but weakened in high power distance cultures.

This paper examines the dynamics of modern Arctic geopolitics, analyzing the growing involvement of major powers-namely the United States, Russia, and China-with a particular focus on United States policy and expansion in the region. In contrast to Russia's militarized approach and China's economic engagement, the United States is shown to possess relatively limited capabilities in the region, hindered by an underdeveloped icebreaker fleet, infrastructure gaps, and diplomatic challenges arising from its increasingly isolationist posture. This analysis calls for a measured but assertive approach to Arctic expansion, grounded in enhanced polar capabilities, infrastructure investment, and multilateral cooperation to balance geopolitical risks. The paper concludes that such expansion is not only necessary to safeguard American strategic interests but is also key to counterbalancing adversarial advances and ensuring long-term energy security and access to trade routes, driving both economic growth and regional stability.

Through rigorous analysis of three samples (N=1,643 gig workers) using MEDCURVE nonlinear mediation and Neyman moderation techniques, we demonstrate a complex relationship between perceived algorithmic power and worker well-being. Our findings reveal that while moderate levels of perceived algorithmic power may initially appear beneficial, they ultimately undermine job well-being through the erosion of worker autonomy - a relationship mediated by unmet autonomy needs and partially moderated by algorithmic transparency. Grounded in self-determination theory, this research provides empirical evidence that algorithmic power functions as an oppressive management mechanism rather than a neutral efficiency tool. The PAPQ&apos;s validation enables precise measurement of how workers experience algorithmic control, addressing a critical gap in digital labor research. Importantly, our results challenge platform narratives about technological neutrality, showing how opaque automated systems enforce compliance while systematically diminishing worker agency. These findings have significant theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, they contribute to reconceptualizing algorithmic power as a multidimensional construct with measurable psychological consequences. Practically, they highlight the urgent need for platform governance reforms and pointed out directions for participatory algorithm design and enhanced regulatory oversight.

This review article, using Scopus data, examines the knowledge management approach as a solution for sustainable development and reducing environmental challenges in this industry. The present study was based on a systematic review of 250 articles from 2000 to 2023, and bibliometric analysis identified trends, technologies, and research gaps. The results showed that China has a dominant role in scientific production with 242 articles and 4435 citations, while countries such as Australia and Canada have a significant impact with international collaborations (18.11%) and high citations (1286 and 1025, respectively). Key topics such as \u201csustainable development\u201d, \u201cmining\u201d, and \u201cenvironmental management\u201d were highlighted as the main research themes, which is in line with the increase in the number of articles since 2015 (over 100 articles in 2024). By facilitating the creation, sharing, and application of knowledge, knowledge management offers solutions such as green technologies, circular economy, and educational programs for local communities. Analysis of collaboration networks revealed that Chinese authors such as Zhang Y (23 articles) and institutions such as China University of Mining and Technology (135 articles) play a pivotal role. The study emphasizes the importance of international collaboration and the use of new technologies to reduce environmental impacts, and suggests that knowledge management can enhance sustainability in the mining industry by integrating scientific data.

The study took place at a South African university. Five online and five face-to-face role plays tool place amongst 30 senior accounting students. Survey and focus group data was obtained on students\u2019 perceptions of the usefulness of the role-plays.Main findingsStudents perceived the role-plays to have enhanced their awareness and understanding of ethical dilemmas, and helpful preparation for navigating future possible ethical dilemmas in the workplace. Furthermore, role-plays were perceived to enhance students\u2019 understanding of technical knowledge and the development of other professional skills, such as critical thinking, listening and questioning skills, dealing with complex matters, conflict resolution and professional behaviour. Students preferred face-to-face role-plays, but still found online role-plays useful, and requested that role-plays be incorporated as a teaching method in university courses."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u5e94\u5bf9\u804c\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "research_question": "\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5b66\u751f\u5982\u4f55\u770b\u5f85\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u804c\u573a\u4f26\u7406\u56f0\u5883\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u80fd\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5e08\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4f26\u7406\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\uff08\u7ebf\u4e0a\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0b\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf930\u540d\u9ad8\u5e74\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u7126\u70b9\u5c0f\u7ec4\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "findings": "\u5b66\u751f\u8ba4\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u56f0\u5883\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u804c\u573a\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u3001\u503e\u542c\u4e0e\u63d0\u95ee\u3001\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u3002\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u7eb3\u5165\u5927\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\u57f9\u517b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5927\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7eb3\u5165\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6559\u80b2\u3002"}}

This study examined Australia\u2019s 2002 shift from heavy-handed to light-handed airport regulation. We assessed the financial performance of seven private airports using Economic Value Added (EVA) to evaluate economic profit before and after the reform. Results showed no statistically significant difference in EVA across the two periods. However, regional economic indicators\u2014such as gross state product and employment\u2014showed notable improvements during the light-handed regulatory period, suggesting a possible association between the regulatory shift and broader economic activity. In addition, we examined the key factors affecting airport financial performance when applying economic regulation to airport pricing. Using hierarchical regression analysis, we identified several factors influencing financial performance, including aircraft movements, asset returns, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), capital structure, free cash flow, asset utilization, and lending rates. While light-handed regulation provided limited evidence of improvements in airport economic profitability, it appeared to incentivize infrastructure investment, potentially contributing to regional economic development. These findings highlight the greater influence of financial and operational management over regulatory design and offer insights for policymakers seeking to align oversight with broader economic goals."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a2002\u5e74\u4ece\u4e25\u683c\u76d1\u7ba1\u8f6c\u5411\u8f7b\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u673a\u573a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f7b\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u867d\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u573a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5229\u6da6\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "research_question": "\u8f7b\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u673a\u573a\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u673a\u573a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u76d1\u7ba1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u4e25\u683c\u4e0e\u8f7b\u5ea6\uff09\u5bf9\u673a\u573a\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u52a0\u503c\uff08EVA\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EVA\u8bc4\u4f30\u6539\u9769\u524d\u540e\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5229\u6da6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "findings": "\u8f7b\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u672a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u673a\u573a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5229\u6da6\uff0c\u4f46\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5dde\u751f\u4ea7\u603b\u503c\u548c\u5c31\u4e1a\uff09\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u822a\u73ed\u91cf\u3001\u8d44\u4ea7\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This trade-off is often addressed by rebalancing idle vehicles, with few methods incorporating anticipation into routing and matching decisions. Building upon previous research, where the weight of the anticipatory component\u2014represented by a parameter \u03b8\u2014is manually preset and fixed throughout, we identify a key limitation: such static settings may fail to adapt to evolving system conditions. To address this, we propose a method in which \u03b8 is computed endogenously and dynamically adjusts in response to environmental changes, encouraging vehicles to end their trips in high-demand zones as appropriate. To achieve this, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with an Actor-Critic architecture, enabling the model to learn spatiotemporal demand-supply patterns and generate policies that balance short-term and long-term efficiency. Through simulations on real-world data from Manhattan (USA) and Utrecht (Netherlands), our approach consistently outperforms fixed-parameter and non-anticipatory baselines by reducing both rejection rates and user costs.

Given the cost differences between fast-charging and slow-charging service providers, and the varying degrees of charging anxiety among users for the two types of services, the government needs to weigh the impact of different subsidy methods on service provider costs and user psychology to formulate effective incentive policies. We construct a price competition game model for fast and slow charging service providers to analyze the impact of different subsidy policies on their pricing strategies and profits, thereby revealing the conditions under which collaborative incentive policies are applicable. We find that consumer-side subsidies, by reducing users\u2019 actual payment prices, drive up the pricing of high-cost fast-charging service providers and expand their market share, while squeezing the profits of slow-charging service providers, \u201cresulting\u201d in a differentiated market structure where fast charging offers \u201chigh-price, high-quality\u201d services and slow charging offers \u201clow-price, accessible\u201d services. Supply-side subsidies, on the other hand, alleviate the cost disadvantages of fast charging and promote its market expansion, but intensify the price competition pressure on slow-charging service providers. The effectiveness of the two subsidy policies highly depends on the cost differences between service providers and the degree of user charging anxiety. When cost differences are large and charging anxiety is low, consumer-side subsidies are more effective; when cost differences are small or charging anxiety is high, supply-side subsidies are more effective. If the policy preferences of the two types of service providers conflict, prioritizing policies that favor fast charging could achieve a Pareto improvement.

In order to satisfy customer demands, modern cloud infrastructures must maximize utilization of resources while decreasing energy consumption, which has a direct impact on operating costs and environmental impact. It is crucial to maintain a balance because optimizing energy consumption might lead to in lower service quality, SLA violates, and underutilized resources. While cloud providers have a higher priority on cost reduction and service dependability, cloud users seek for quick execution within budget limits. Objectives like resource utilization, energy efficiency, and SLA adherence frequently conflict in this complex, multi-objective optimization scenario. These conflicting objectives cannot be met by traditional single-objective approaches. Our solution to this problem is a Multi-objective Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (MSPEA), which efficiently schedules virtual machines (VMs) to PMs with the objective of minimizing energy consumption and SLA violations while improving average resource utilization. The CloudSim 3.0.3 simulator is used to simulate this technique and results compared with benchmark algorithms such as MOHEFT and SPEA2 algorithm. According to the simulation results, the proposed model finds the best tradeoffs between the conflicting goals compared to its peers, providing better trade-offs and overall improvement in key performance metrics."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08MSPEA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u5ea6\u865a\u62df\u673a\uff08VM\uff09\u5230\u7269\u7406\u673a\uff08PM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u548cSLA\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u5ea6\u865a\u62df\u673a\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548cSLA\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08SPEA\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSPEA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CloudSim 3.0.3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eMOHEFT\u548cSPEA2\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "findings": "MSPEA\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u3001SLA\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

This work proposes a modular logistics framework tailored for multi-contractor environments (e.g., KBR-AP, Amentum, Vectrus, Constellis, DynCorp, Louis Berger), capable of adapting to troop surges, terrain limitations, and force protection protocols. The framework addresses bottlenecks such as redundant clearances, last-mile delays, and fragmented base access procedures, offering practical solutions rooted in real-world execution. The result is a replicable model for the U.S. Department of Defense and its subcontractors, engineered to achieve mission continuity with reduced logistical drag.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7269\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u4e1c\u7f8e\u519b\u57fa\u5730\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u652f\u6301\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u4ee5\u79d1\u5a01\u7279\u4e3a\u4f8b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u5ba1\u6279\u3001\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u627f\u5305\u5546\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u7269\u6d41\u652f\u6301\u884c\u52a8\uff1f", "motivation": "\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u7269\u6d41\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u5ba1\u6279\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6563\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7269\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u627f\u5305\u5546\u73af\u5883\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7269\u6d41\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u7269\u6d41\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u591a\u627f\u5305\u5546\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u9632\u90e8\u53ca\u5176\u5206\u5305\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u7269\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Therefore, TTOs are an indispensable part of this environment, given their position in the entrepreneurship ecosystem today. Using actor-network and stakeholder approaches as theoretical lenses, the present research examines the role of TTOs in entrepreneurial ecosystem formation and function and analyzes how interface activities shape collaborative environments embedded within entrepreneurial ecosystems. In terms of the unit of analysis, TTOs operating in Turkey have been selected from the University-Industry Collaboration Centers Platform of Turkey as the area of investigation, and the data of the people who have undertaken/are undertaking managerial duties in these interface structures within the period 2013-2023 have been analyzed. The findings of the study are based on a dataset combining curriculum vita and interviews, the results of the study indicate significant differences between the managers who have previous industry and project experience and those who do not. In addition, the problem of dual careers of managers has been effective in increasing the staff turnover rate in TTOs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u79fb\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff08TTOs\uff09\u5728\u521b\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u754c\u9762\u6d3b\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u534f\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u571f\u8033\u5176\u7684TTOs\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9TTOs\u8fd0\u4f5c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "TTOs\u5728\u521b\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u4ec0\u4e48\u89d2\u8272\uff1f\u5176\u754c\u9762\u6d3b\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u534f\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\uff1f", "motivation": "TTOs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u5171-\u5927\u5b66-\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\uff08PUIC\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u63a5\u53e3\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u521b\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u571f\u8033\u5176\u7684TTOs\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u67902013-2023\u5e74\u95f4\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7684\u5c65\u5386\u548c\u8bbf\u8c08\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6709\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u804c\u4e1a\u95ee\u9898\u589e\u52a0\u4e86TTOs\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u6d41\u52a8\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86TTOs\u5728\u521b\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3aTTOs\u7684\u62db\u8058\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u91cd\u89c6\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u53cc\u91cd\u804c\u4e1a\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Using nationally representative data from the FinScope Consumer Ghana Survey in 2021, we develop a novel three-component framework that disaggregates financial inclusion into financial literacy, financial access, and behavioural biases. Employing an instrumental variable approach to address endogeneity concerns, we find that financial literacy significantly influences saving behaviour, with its effect varying across demographic subgroups. Financial access consistently plays a prominent role in shaping saving decisions. In some contexts, behavioural biases, such as trust and stigma, also serve as strong determinants. Our findings contribute to the literature in a threefold manner. Primarily, by developing a three-component framework for financial inclusion which can be replicated across developing and developed contexts. Secondly, by providing credible causal identification through a structured auxiliary evidence framework for instrument validation.

This study examines the OPEC members' economic growth regarding oil price, oil production, capital, and labour stocks. The study used the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) to test for unit roots among the variables. The test result shows that although none of the variables is stationary at level, they are all stationary at first difference. Based on the Hausman test, the fixed effect was the suitable analysis method. The study, therefore, found that oil production is not significant in influencing the economic growth of OPEC member countries. In contrast, oil prices, labour force, and capital formation significantly affect countries' economic growth. The relationship between oil prices and oil-producing countries' economic growth is negative. The study recommends that OPEC member countries develop competitive goods and services to serve as an alternative source of generating revenue. It was also recommended that oil-producing countries should take advantage of their labour force by developing them and making them available for brain export to improve foreign currency inflow in the medium term."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86OPEC\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u6cb9\u4ef7\u3001\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ea7\u91cf\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6cb9\u4ef7\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ea7\u91cf\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5efa\u8baeOPEC\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u53d1\u5c55\u66ff\u4ee3\u6536\u5165\u6765\u6e90\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5229\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "OPEC\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u6cb9\u4ef7\u3001\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ea7\u91cf\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6cb9\u4ef7\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u8fdc\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9OPEC\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6cb9\u4ef7\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ADF\u68c0\u9a8c\u53d8\u91cf\u5355\u4f4d\u6839\uff0cHausman\u68c0\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u6cb9\u4ef7\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ea7\u91cf\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u6cb9\u4ef7\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6cb9\u4ef7\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8baeOPEC\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u53d1\u5c55\u66ff\u4ee3\u4ea7\u4e1a\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u77f3\u6cb9\u6536\u5165\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

In this study, we examine the drivers of food waste on a large farm-to-table platform in Indonesia that operates both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) channels. Methodology/results: We collaborate with Sayurbox and analyze detailed inbound procurement order-product level data and outbound customer order data across its two channels. Using a two-part empirical model, we estimate the probability and volume of food waste as a result of demand scale, supply structure, and platform profit policy. We find that a larger customer base reduces waste, particularly in the B2C channel. A larger supply base and higher markup percentages lead to higher waste. Direct farm sourcing reduces waste in B2B, but its benefits are muted in B2C, likely due to greater distance from agricultural production zones and associated logistical frictions. Counterfactual analyses suggest that supply-side adjustments could reduce total waste by up to 16%.

However, the delayed or non-adoption of AI technologies poses significant strategic risks that are often underestimated. This paper presents and elaborates on the concept of AI Extinction Zones, a market environment characterized by insufficient AI integration resulting in gradual organizational decline. Drawing on a narrative literature review and comparative case analysis, the study identifies five interrelated risk factors contributing to this decline: organizational inertia, strategic myopia, leadership deficits, resource misallocation, and ethical paralysis. By examining public cases, such as Sears, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Walmart, and Moderna, this paper demonstrates that shallow or delayed adoption of artificial intelligence undermines innovation, market relevance, and long-term viability. The findings indicate that failure to adopt is not the sole threat; rather, superficial or misaligned adoption can also prove to be equally detrimental. A strategic resilience framework is proposed to assist organizations in evading or preventing extinction, focusing on deep integration, leadership capabilities, cultural agility, and timely investment.

Despite growing urgency, current climate risk management strategies are rather individuated by firms, and siloed across sectors. A lack of shared, accessible knowledge on climate risks to real estate and infrastructure hinders coordinated, transparent, and integrated decision-making. This highlights the need for structured transdisciplinary approaches that foster collaboration between researchers and practitioners to co-produce knowledge and develop integrated adaptation solutions.This article introduces a novel framework to facilitate transdisciplinary knowledge production for integrated real estate and infrastructure climate risk management. Combining institutionalized logics theory with AI-driven techniques, the framework comprises four interconnected phases: (1) knowledge elicitation, (2) knowledge exploration, (3) knowledge integration, and (4) knowledge transformation. Using a mixed-method approach, the framework is developed through a literature review on transdisciplinary research, and further evolved by incorporating empirical insights and experiential learning gained while applying it within the Red&Blue (Real Estate Development and Building in Low Urban Environments) research program.\u00a0Applying the framework to the Red&Blue case study reveals that effective transdisciplinary knowledge production requires not only a structured process but also an adaptive, and iterative approach. Key enablers include sustained stakeholders engagement, safe-space dialogue, conscious knowledge integration, and integrative leadership. These elements foster trust, improve communication, and support the co-creation of actionable and transferable knowledge to address complex climate risk and sustainability challenges in urbanized built environments in the Netherlands and beyond."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5236\u5ea6\u903b\u8f91\u7406\u8bba\u548cAI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u6846\u67b6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6574\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6d3c\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u96c6\u5730\u533a\uff08\u5982\u8377\u5170\uff09\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5236\u5ea6\u903b\u8f91\u7406\u8bba\u4e0eAI\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff08Red&Blue\u9879\u76ee\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u5305\u62ec\u6301\u7eed\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5236\u5ea6\u903b\u8f91\u548cAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8377\u5170\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u533a\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6311\u6218\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}

While ESG has often been discussed in the context of corporate responsibility and compliance, this research adopts a strategic perspective, studying its role for differentiation, innovation, and stakeholder trust. Starting from the theoretical contributions of Porter, Teece, and Freeman, the analysis employs a qualitative multiple-case approach, examining Too Good To Go, Veja, and Nestl\u00e9 for the comparison of ESG integration across different firm sizes and maturity levels. The findings reveal a contrast between ESG as a foundational business logic in SMEs and its fragmented implementation in larger corporations. Additionally, the research shows that the strategic effectiveness of ESG depends not only on internal commitment but also on external support, regulatory coherence, and transparency mechanisms. Ultimately, the thesis demonstrates that ESG can be more than a compliance exercise: it is a transformative tool for sustainable growth, particularly for agile, mission-driven enterprises willing to align purpose with performance."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u65bdESG\u539f\u5219\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ESG\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u5408\u89c4\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "research_question": "\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684ESG\u539f\u5219\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\uff1f", "motivation": "ESG\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e3a\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u6218\u7565\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8ePorter\u3001Teece\u548cFreeman\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u591a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790Too Good To Go\u3001Veja\u548cNestl\u00e9\u7684ESG\u6574\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "findings": "ESG\u5728\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u5546\u4e1a\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5927\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u5219\u5448\u73b0\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5b9e\u65bd\uff1b\u5176\u6218\u7565\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u627f\u8bfa\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u652f\u6301\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1ESG\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u5408\u89c4\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u8fc7ESG\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u4e0e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Methods: Annual data on inflation rate, unemployment rate, per capita gross domestic product (at current prices), the share of health expenditures in GDP, and urbanization rate were collected from reputable domestic and international sources. Short-and long-term relationships were assessed using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and the Bounds Test. The speed of adjustment was evaluated through the error correction model (ECM), and causality relationships were explored using relevant statistical tests. Results: The findings indicate that inflation and unemployment rates exert significant negative effects on life expectancy, while per capita income and the share of health expenditures in GDP positively influence public health outcomes. The error correction term suggests a relatively rapid adjustment of the health index to equilibrium after economic shocks. Causality tests demonstrate that macroeconomic variables predominantly drive changes in the public health index. Conclusions: Effective and sustainable inflation control, targeted labor market support, and increasing the share of health expenditures in GDP are critical policy recommendations for improving community health.

However, for C2C transaction in a virtual environment, there is an issue of congenital transaction asymmetry, leading to increased uncertainties and transaction risks as well as credit speculation, false transactions, and other credit problems. These problems not only affect the development of enterprises to a large extent, but also hinder the development of e-commerce ultimately. In order to guarantee the safety of both transaction parties, it is particularly important to establish a sound credit evaluation system for shopping sites. Through the analysis of the shortcomings of the existing C2C e-commerce credit evaluation model, this paper proposes a two-way e-commerce credit evaluation model based on the C2C mode.

To identify a causal effect of AI on firm productivity, we exploit variation of the adoption of AI across industries and use an instrumental variable (IV) empirical approach. Our results indicate that using AI and the intensity of using AI across business areas have positive effects on firm level productivity over and above other capital and labour inputs and controlling for unobserved industry-specific effects.

Operators insist that large content providers, who are effectively free riding on operator infrastructure, should be required to contribute a \u201cfair share\u201d of the costs of delivering their content; they believe new policies should facilitate this. Yet in most policy discussions, \u201cfairness\u201d appears as a purely rhetorical concept, seldom accompanied by concrete methods of quantification. Many policy recommendations suggest that cost shares should be bargained by operators and content providers, and regulators should step in if negotiations are not successful. Although this paper does not take a position on either side of the debate, by employing a cooperative game-theoretic framework it seeks to clarify what \u201cfair share\u201d could mean in rigorous economic terms. My theoretical model builds on the externality created by content providers originating large volumes of internet traffic, who do not pay for and have no incentive to limit the resulting infrastructure costs. Central to our cooperative framework is the hypothetical \u201cgrand coalition,\u201d in which all players (operators, content providers, and consumers) cooperate to maximize a joint surplus, thereby fully internalizing this externality. Hypothetical coalitions, including only part of the players, might also partially reduce it. Each coalition\u2019s value is defined in its ability to mitigate the externality, and each player\u2019s contribution to that mitigation provides a basis for allocating costs. I rely on the Shapley value to examine how operators, content providers, and consumers should share traffic-generated costs under this widely used conception of fairness. My results suggest that, according to the Shapley value, operators and content providers should split costs equally, leaving no direct burden on consumers. In the case of multiple competing operators, their half of the cost should be further split between them equally. The model aims for ease of practical implementation; hence, the suggested share measures depend only on observable cost parameters. With such a cost-sharing regulation in place, and taken into account by players in their optimization, the market equilibrium shifts closer to the social optimum, infrastructure deployment rises, and at high infrastructure cost levels, both consumer surplus and total welfare improve."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e2d\u201c\u516c\u5e73\u4efd\u989d\u201d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u5e94\u5e73\u5206\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u627f\u62c5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u201c\u516c\u5e73\u4efd\u989d\u201d\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u201c\u516c\u5e73\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u201c\u5927\u8054\u76df\u201d\u5047\u8bbe\u548cShapley\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5728\u6210\u672c\u5206\u644a\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "findings": "\u6839\u636eShapley\u503c\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u5e94\u5e73\u5206\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u627f\u62c5\uff1b\u591a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u65f6\u6210\u672c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5747\u5206\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u201c\u516c\u5e73\u4efd\u989d\u201d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5206\u644a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

The 9/11 Commission (2004) identified communication gaps as a key failure and recommended a nationwide high-speed network for first responders, leading to the creation of FirstNet a decade later in 2012. However, centralized networks remain vulnerable to disruptions with single points of failure, as demonstrated by the innumerable outages and data breaches affecting all networks and services, occasionally affecting FirstNet itself. Using mixed research methods, this paper employs qualitative policy and quantitative survey data analysis to evaluate the potential effectiveness of decentralized, Zero Trust models in improving network resilience. It draws on academic research and empirical case studies to assess whether decentralized, community-driven networks can mitigate occurrences and impacts of cyberattacks and network misconfigurations, and the impacts of environmental disasters. This paper concludes that decentralized, community-operated telecommunications networks can augment traditional network models and enhance resilience against cyber threats and environmental disasters. By distributing network control across multiple localized nodes, decentralized architectures mitigate single points of failure often exploited by cybercriminals and nation-state adversaries."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u3001\u96f6\u4fe1\u4efb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u4fe1\u548c\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u97e7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u73af\u5883\u707e\u5bb3\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u3001\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u9891\u7387\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u591a\u6b21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65ad\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u96f6\u4fe1\u4efb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u3001\u793e\u533a\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u7535\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u73af\u5883\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u97e7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u8865\u5145\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Targeting high-level managers, dynamic governance officials, and ESG strategists, the study provides actionable insights for aligning national policies with SDG17 objectives to foster a sustainable future. Through a comprehensive analysis of ESG and SDG midpoint assessments, the dissertation identifies gaps in nations\u2019 implementation strategies, particularly in vulnerable countries, where the absence of robust partnerships and coordinated management hinders progress toward the 17 SDG targets.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n The research reveals that most nations have faced significant setbacks in achieving SDG goals due to deficiencies in ESG leadership and inadequate collaboration frameworks. Despite decades of guidance from the United Nations, the lack of visionary ESG leaders and insufficient coordination among nations has led to widespread failures in meeting sustainability targets. The study highlights that only a few OECD nations demonstrate exemplary ESG governance, serving as models for others. To address these challenges, the dissertation proposes a transformative framework that emphasizes accelerated ESG programs, capacity building, and cross-national partnerships to remediate lagging indicators and promote sustainable human development.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Key findings underscore the necessity of aligning ESG leadership with SDG17\u2019s focus on partnerships, technology, trade, systemic policy reforms, capacity building, and innovative financial mechanisms. These elements are identified as critical catalysts for reducing the burden on future ESG leaders and ensuring resilient progress in vulnerable nations. The dissertation advocates for the training and development of ESG visionaries by leading SDG nations to empower lagging countries, fostering uncompromised progress toward sustainability. It also introduces a novel approach to meta-mapping national ESG pathways, incorporating Gross National Happiness (GNH) as an accelerator to prioritize human-centric sustainability goals.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n The study emphasizes urgent priorities for vulnerable nations, including climate adaptation, sustainable fisheries, and addressing violence against children. It further advocates for agricultural innovation, self-sufficient community gardens, and nutrition programs to combat hunger and improve health outcomes. The dissertation calls for advanced tools, such as online training platforms, to cultivate future ESG leaders equipped to tackle SDG challenges. It also recommends further research into universal healthcare access and measurement of unmet health needs to ensure equitable progress.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n In conclusion, this dissertation provides a strategic roadmap for nations to overcome SDG implementation challenges by strengthening ESG leadership and fostering global partnerships.

Balancing fairness and efficiency has become a persistent dilemma. Digital transformation offers potential opportunities for solving this problem, but research is needed to determine whether significant changes result and the underlying mechanisms of their impact. Using data from China\u2019s A-share listed firms from 2013\u20132022, this study examines the impact of the internal pay gap on value creation and the moderating role of digital transformation. The findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between the first two factors. A heterogeneity analysis indicates that this relationship varies significantly across business ownership types, enterprise sizes, regions, industries, and levels of digital transformation. A further analysis shows that digital transformation moderates this inverted U-shaped relationship in two ways. First, it steepens the curve, increasing the sensitivity of employees&apos; pay-to-performance linkage. Second, it shifts the turning point leftward, decreasing the overall internal pay gap and advancing the optimal incentive threshold. By decomposing the pay structure, this study finds that digital transformation narrows the reasonable pay gap while widening the excessive pay gap, creating positive incentives for both employees and executives. In conclusion, this study highlights that digital transformation, as a key driver of the digital economy, can enhance value creation efficiency and better balance equity and efficiency under certain conditions while transforming production relations.ies for solving this problem, but research is needed to determine whether significant changes result and the underlying mechanisms of their impact.

Our findings extend the application of scale economy theories to banking and provide practical implications for decision-making in branch openness and closure."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u94f6\u884c\u7f51\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0e\u94f6\u884c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u94f6\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u53e0\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "research_question": "\u94f6\u884c\u7f51\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u53e0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u94f6\u884c\u7f51\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u94f6\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u94f6\u884c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u94f6\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u7f51\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u94f6\u884c\u7f51\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u53e0\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u94f6\u884c\u7f51\u70b9\u5f00\u8bbe\u548c\u5173\u95ed\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In a laboratory experiment, leaders and followers repeatedly play a weakest-link coordination game, with leaders moving first. When successful coordination yields disproportionately high rewards for leaders, effort is reduced and team performance deteriorates. By contrast, when leaders also bear more substantial strategic risk---in the form of larger losses if coordination fails---team performance initially improves. Leaders appear to trust that assuming such risk will be seen as a motivational act that restores the legitimacy of pay inequality and encourages others to follow. Yet this effect proves difficult to sustain, as coordination often unravels even after the efficient outcome has been reached. We conclude that while risk-based legitimacy can support coordination under inequality, the greater challenge lies in sustaining it."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u627f\u62c5\u4e0b\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u85aa\u916c\u5dee\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u627f\u62c5\u66f4\u591a\u98ce\u9669\u65f6\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u7ee9\u6548\u77ed\u671f\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u3002", "research_question": "\u66b4\u9732\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u4e8e\u4e0b\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u85aa\u916c\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u85aa\u916c\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u5bf9\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u627f\u62c5\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u627f\u62c5\u5bf9\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u548c\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u91cd\u590d\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u534f\u8c03\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "findings": "\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u627f\u62c5\u66f4\u591a\u98ce\u9669\u65f6\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u7ee9\u6548\u77ed\u671f\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u85aa\u916c\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u85aa\u916c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u62c5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Theory of intellectual styles and their development To date, there is a large amount of literature on general intelligence and multiple intelligences. There are many samples that measure this dymenia, but data on mind management up to this point in which I read the article had not reached me. They were not interested in the first lines yet, so I decided to write a report on it. According to the author, intelligence depends on both external and internal causes. The external causes are the social reality, the prerequisites in which a person is realized, and the internal ones from the general intelligence and personality features. Data on the subject can be found in the works of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau. Intelligence management is about how we orient it and what we use it for. The fact that several individuals are placed in the same environment does not mean that they will handle their crystallized intelligence in the same way. On the contrary, man's understandings, his desires and peculiarities will prompt him in one way or another to use his intelligence by his own methods. Exactly this is depicted by the example of the three roommates who have the same level of abilities, but are carried out in different areas of life.

While traditional numerical methods require repetitive computations for varying parameters, existing Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) struggle with long-term forecasting accuracy for time-dependent traffic-related partial differential equations. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative deep learning framework\u2014a Sequential Learning-based Fourier Neural Operator (SELF). Specifically, SELF subdivides the time domain into non-overlapping sub-domains, assigning independent operator networks to each. Additionally, employing a sequential training strategy enables capturing dynamic changes in physical evolution from initial time steps, ensuring the model learns and comprehends unique features of each sub-domain and the complete temporal sequence. To further reduce training costs, a transfer learning method is introduced, leveraging optimal parameters and accumulated knowledge from prior training stages. Experiments on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model show that SELF achieves a \u200b19% reduction in solution error\u200b and a \u200b67% decrease in training costs\u200b compared to vanilla FNO, demonstrating its efficacy for traffic flow initial and boundary value problems.

We construct an LSTM-PINN-coupled source model for displacement prediction, optimize network parameters via Bayesian methods for deep learning training, and analyze pre-training results to demonstrate the reliability of the LSTM-PINN-coupled source model as a foundation for subsequent transfer learning. Furthermore, displacement transfer models under various environmental conditions are established, verifying the accuracy and superiority of LSTM-PINN transfer-coupled model predictions across different operating scenarios, thereby providing theoretical foundations and technical support for risk assessment."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548cLSTM-PINN\uff08\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6-\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u8fc1\u79fb\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u7ebf\u4f4d\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u8b66\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548cLSTM-PINN\u8fc1\u79fb\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d77\u6d0b\u5e73\u53f0\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6d77\u6d0b\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u5b89\u88c5\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u9636\u6bb5\u5e38\u9700\u4e0e\u8239\u8236\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u6d77\u6d0b\u8bbe\u65bd\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f4d\u79fb\u662f\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u8b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u8b66\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "LSTM-PINN\uff08\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6-\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u8fc1\u79fb\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLSTM-PINN\u8026\u5408\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4d\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LSTM-PINN\u8fc1\u79fb\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6d77\u6d0b\u5e73\u53f0\u4f4d\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6d77\u6d0b\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

New arrivals enter the system only in the first queue, independently from slot to slot; the probability generating function (pgf) of the number of new arrivals per slot is indicated as A(z). The output process of the first queue constitutes the input process to the second queue. Both servers are (possibly) subject to mutually independent random server interruptions which occur independently from slot to slot; \u03c31 and \u03c32 indicate the probabilities that server 1 and server 2 are available during any slot.We first analyze the system contents (i.e., numbers of customers present) in both queues. As it is not impacted by the events in queue 2, the queue-1 system content can be analyzed quite straightforwardly. However, the system-content analysis of queue 2 and the whole tandem system is more complicated. We first prove that the system contents of both queues are mutually independent if and only if the arrival process is a Bernoulli process, i.e., A(z) = 1\u2212\u03bb+\u03bbz. For general arrival pgfs A(z), we establish a functional equation for the steady-state joint pgf of the two system contents, and we succeed to solve this equation explicitly if \u03c31 = 1 and/or \u03c32 = 1.The most challenging part of the paper is concerned with the analysis of the customer delays. Here, we develop a variety of different mathematical approaches to compute the steady-state pgfs of the delay of an arbitrary customer in queue 1, in queue 2, and in the whole tandem system. Exact closed-form results are obtained for two main cases: either arbitrary \u03c31 and \u03c32, combined with Bernoulli arrivals, or \u03c31 = 1 and/or \u03c32 = 1, in combination with general arrival pgfs A(z)."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u5355\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u961f\u5217\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u4e32\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u961f\u5217\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u4e32\u8054\u961f\u5217\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u961f\u5217\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e32\u8054\u961f\u5217\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u6392\u961f\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\uff08pgf\uff09\u7684\u6392\u961f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u529f\u80fd\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u961f\u5217\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7a33\u6001pgf\u3002", "findings": "\u961f\u5217\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u5230\u8fbe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u5230\u8fbepgf\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u961f\u5217\u5185\u5bb9\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u6001pgf\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6392\u961f\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, limited driving range and insufficient charging infrastructure remain significant barriers to widespread adoption for touristic travel. Launched in 2022, the Lake Michigan Circuit initiative aims to expand charging infrastructure along the coastline. This study presents an optimization framework for siting and sizing DC Fast Charging stations, accounting for budget constraints, EV user behavior, stochastic queuing delays, and real-world grid upgrade costs. To model flexible EV user behavior during tourism trips, a charging station assignment algorithm is proposed using a buffer range that includes multiple charging options. A Modified Constrained Simulated Annealing (MCSA) algorithm is introduced, which decomposes the problem into location and sizing subproblems and incorporates a dynamic penalty method for constraint handling. MCSA\u2019s performance is benchmarked against a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and validated through implicit enumeration on a small-scale case study. Results demonstrate that MCSA can yield higher-quality solutions with reduced runtime and computational effort. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses explore the effects of budget limits, charger power levels, and user behavior assumptions. Findings show that while lower budgets increase queuing time and reduce charger availability, a minimum number of stations is required to ensure trip feasibility. Also, 150\u202fkW chargers offer the best performance under limited available funding.

Using a comprehensive dataset of 10,274 bank-year observations from 1995 to 2024,we construct a novel cybersecurity risk index through textual analysis of the risk factor sections in the banks\u2019 10-K filings. Our baseline results reveal a\u00a0 significant positive relationship between cybersecurity risk and bank competition. To address endogeneity concerns, we employ instrumental variable approach, dynamic Difference-in-Differences, Propensity Score Matching, and Entropy Balancing methods. Next, we explore the mechanisms through which cyber risk drives bank\u00a0 competition and find that the effect is stronger for banks with high earnings volatility, elevated funding costs, and unstable deposit growth. Cross-sectional results show that smaller, riskier, and operationally constrained banks are more exposed to competitive pressures under heightened cyber threats.

This study designs and evaluates a semi-on-demand hybrid route directional service in the public transit network, offering on-demand flexible route service in low-density areas and fixed route service in higher-density areas. We develop analytically tractable cost expressions that capture access, waiting, and riding costs for users, and distance-based operating and time-based vehicle costs for operators. Two formulations are presented for strategic and tactical decisions in flexible route portion, fleet size, headway, and vehicle size optimization, enabling the determination of route types between fixed, hybrid, and flexible routes based on demand, cost, and operational parameters. Analytical results demonstrate that the lower operating costs of SAVs favor more flexible route services. The practical applications and benefits of semi-on-demand feeders are presented with numerical examples and a large-scale case study in the Chicago metropolitan area. Findings reveal scenarios in which flexible route portions serving passengers located further away reduce total costs, particularly user costs, whereas higher demand densities favor more traditional line-based operations. On two studied lines and a large-scale case study in the Chicago metropolitan area, USA, current cost forecasts suggest smaller vehicles with fully flexible routes are optimal, but operating constraints or higher operating costs would favor larger vehicles with hybrid routes.

Further review of these articles resulted in four main themes, i.e., digital capability, digital strategy, digital technology, and digital leadership. Several recommendations are highlighted related to conducting more qualitative studies, having specific and standard systematic review methods for guiding research synthesis in the context of digital transformation adoption impact and practising complementary searching techniques such as citation tracking, reference searching, and contacting experts.

However, its adoption in sectors involving perishable items poses distinct operational challenges, like temporal mismatch between store preparation and consumers' consumption. Therefore, our study aims to assess how BOPS influences consumer purchasing behavior in scenarios where perishability is a key consideration. We conducted an empirical investigation in the fast-food catering industry, analyzing customer transaction data from a prominent Chinese restaurant. By applying propensity score matching and a difference-indifference methodology, we found that adopting BOPS in this context led to a reduction in both the frequency and amount of consumer purchases. We also identified potential mechanisms behind these negative effects of BOPS, including the quality deterioration, prolonged waiting times, and hassle experiences inherent to the BOPS process. Moreover, our research revealed that the impact of BOPS varied across different offline store ordering modes, such as menu-driven versus tangible product-driven ordering.

This research utilises a unique dataset that tracks the daily consumption of 9,778 random premium subscribers of a major European music streaming platform, who found 4,136 distinct new songs via algorithmic recommendations or human-curated playlists. Using the number of repeat organic streams as an indicator of preference matching, we demonstrate that algorithmic recommendations generally enhance song discovery, particularly for tracks released by lesser-known artists. Conversely, human recommendations perform better when introducing songs from artists unfamiliar to the user. While algorithmic recommendations can, in specific contexts, create imbalances and skew sales distribution, they ultimately assist consumers in finding items that suit their preferences in streaming services."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6b27\u6d32\u97f3\u4e50\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u6d88\u8d39\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u6b4c\u66f2\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u77e5\u540d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u65f6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "research_question": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u6b4c\u66f2\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5982\u4f55\u53d1\u73b0\u7b26\u5408\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75289,778\u540d\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u6d88\u8d39\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u4e0d\u77e5\u540d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u4f5c\u54c1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Companies have been increasingly integrating group-buying campaigns into social media platforms to further accelerate demand growth. However, tapping into these expansive social networks can heighten users' privacy concerns especially regarding the uncontrolled exposure risks as personal information propagates across widening social circles. Despite the tension between leveraging social networks for viral marketing and addressing privacy concerns, the empirical effects of social networks and privacy concerns on group buying behaviors remain unclear. This knowledge gap persists primarily because of the inability to observe underlying peer connections in many group-buying datasets. We address this research gap by applying an econometric technique tailored for social network effects with unobserved networks to the group buying context. Leveraging a novel group-buying dataset on a Chinese social media platform, we measure the impacts of social networks and privacy concerns on users' group-buying behavior while the links of social networks are unobserved. We find that (1) An individual user is more likely to participate in group buying when close friends have signed up. (2) A privacy-sensitive user is less likely to participate in group buying themselves. However, (3) when close friends with high privacy sensitivity sign up, the individual user would be more likely to participate in group buying, indicating a positive contextual effect of privacy concern. Beyond these main effects, we also examine how the impact of privacy concerns varies across regions with different economic development levels. Further, we examine how underlying social network structural features-particularly network degree and centrality-affect group-buying participation decisions. Our findings provide important implications for platforms to design group-buying mechanisms."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u5bf9\u56e2\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u670b\u53cb\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u7684\u56e2\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u56e2\u8d2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u64ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u5bf9\u56e2\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56fd\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u56e2\u8d2d\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "1. \u7528\u6237\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u56e2\u8d2d\u5f53\u4eb2\u5bc6\u670b\u53cb\u5df2\u53c2\u4e0e\uff1b2. \u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u8eab\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b3. \u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u670b\u53cb\u53c2\u4e0e\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u53cd\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u7edc\u5ea6\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\uff09\u4e5f\u5f71\u54cd\u56e2\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u5bf9\u56e2\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e2\u8d2d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5982\u4f18\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, many existing recommendation systems continue to rely on static analysis, making it difficult to reflect evolving user preferences and the diversity of short video content. To address this challenge, we introduce a recommendation approach that combines large language models with dynamic user profiling, using Kuaishou as a case study. Analyzing the KuaiRec dataset, we observed that while user preferences tend to remain stable over time, they also follow cyclical fluctuations. To analyze multimodal content, large language models were used to extract, segment, and relate key elements from video data. This process facilitated the construction of a video feature knowledge graph based on tags, creators, and soundtrack metadata, improving labeling consistency and accuracy. Based on these findings, we developed a recommendation model that integrates the knowledge graph with dynamic user profiling.

For eight time-tested safeguards, we explore both practical approaches and challenges that could arise in adapting each to an AI context. Among our main findings are that employing human raters at scale and integrated fact-checking are search engine safeguards that appear both highly relevant to and underutilized in today's AI systems.

This paper addresses this question through a comparative analysis of Kenya and Nigeria, two hybrid regimes that introduced laws to criminalize disinformation but experienced sharply different outcomes. Drawing on securitization theory, it argues that outcomes hinge on effective discursive framing and executive-legislature alignment. In Kenya, securitizing actors invoked historical trauma, moral urgency, and national security concerns to justify the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act. In Nigeria, the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill failed amid vague framing, strong civic opposition, and a public trust deficit. The paper offers a relational and context-sensitive account of how digital threats are framed, contested, and legislated. The findings demonstrate that securitization depends on how threats are constructed and negotiate across political and societal arenas. In doing so, the paper contributes to ongoing debates on the politics of platform governance in Africa."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u548c\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u67d0\u4e9b\u5c06\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u5b89\u5168\u5316\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u52aa\u529b\u6210\u529f\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5426\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bba\u8ff0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u884c\u653f\u4e0e\u7acb\u6cd5\u673a\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u67d0\u4e9b\u5c06\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u5b89\u5168\u5316\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u52aa\u529b\u6210\u529f\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u5931\u8d25\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u653f\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7acb\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bba\u8ff0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u6784\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u548c\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "findings": "\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u521b\u4f24\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8ff0\u6210\u529f\u7acb\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u56e0\u6a21\u7cca\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u516c\u6c11\u53cd\u5bf9\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u7f3a\u5931\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6784\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5bf9\u975e\u6d32\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u8fa9\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7acb\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

However, its benefits must be weighed against the costs of future taxation required to service the additional debt. In this paper, we analyze this welfare trade-off by decomposing and quantifying the channels through which fiscal policy impacts aggregate welfare in a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. Our decomposition and quantification shows that, beyond macroeconomic stabilization and redistribution, deficit-financed fiscal policy generates welfare benefits largely through two mechanisms: i) a self-financing channel, and ii) a liquidity channel. We apply our decomposition to create policy ranking measures like Benefits-to-Cost Ratio and the Marginal Value of Public Funds within the HANK model. Using these measures, we compare and rank various fiscal policies-including targeted transfers, mortgage principal relief, moratoriums, and unemployment insurance-based on their overall welfare benefits and 'bang for buck'."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u65b0\u51ef\u6069\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff08HANK\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u603b\u4f53\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d64\u5b57\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u878d\u8d44\u6e20\u9053\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6e20\u9053\u5e26\u6765\u798f\u5229\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\u3002", "research_question": "\u8d64\u5b57\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u798f\u5229\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8d64\u5b57\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u77ed\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u672a\u6765\u7a0e\u6536\u6210\u672c\u9700\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u798f\u5229\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u65b0\u51ef\u6069\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff08HANK\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u6536\u76ca\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u3001\u516c\u5171\u8d44\u91d1\u8fb9\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u8d64\u5b57\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u878d\u8d44\u6e20\u9053\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6e20\u9053\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u798f\u5229\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u798f\u5229\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u540c\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

By design, it also provoked the affected Commissioners to challenge the Administration\u2019s action in federal court, where the Administration intends to invite the Supreme Court to reconsider Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), where the Court rejected a similar constitutional challenge to the FTC Act\u2019s protection against removal of commissioners&nbsp;except for good cause.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Inspired by proponents of the&nbsp;\"Unitary Executive Theory,\" the attempted dismissals implicate more than the \u201cfor&nbsp;cause\u201d constraints on presidential removal&nbsp;powers under the FTC Act. They are,&nbsp;instead, an outgrowth of a broadly conceived effort by the Administration to expand the Executive\u2019s power to control what has derisively been labelled the \u201cadministrative state,\u201d especially with respect to the&nbsp; \u201cindependent\u201d federal administrative agencies.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n In this paper, we argue that \u201cindependent\u201d is a misleading description of the relationship of the FTC to the political process. Even when viewed through the lens of 2025 instead of 1935 when Humphrey\u2019s Executor was decided, the agency is subject to extensive oversight and control by both the president and Congress. Moreover, as the Commission\u2019s authority has expanded since 1914, so too have the controls by which Congress and the Executive oversee and influence its operations. This framework, as it has evolved over 110 years, does not \u201cunduly interfere with the functioning of the Executive Branch.\u201d It is democratically accountable in numerous ways to both the Congress and the Executive.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n As a policy matter, Section 1 of the FTC Act remains vital to the credibility, integrity, and effectiveness of FTC decision-making and the protection of American consumers. Its consumer protection authority is unmatched in the federal government, and its importance for the U.S. economy has only increased over time. With respect to its competition mission, the FTC also provides added institutional capacity, a wider range of tools, and expertise to complement the work of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. And the FTC\u2019s structure is one of its key virtues. For more than a hundred years, the FTC\u2019s multi-member,&nbsp;bipartisan makeup has facilitated deliberation and collaborative decision-making, allowed for&nbsp;dissent, and helped to build the agency\u2019s expertise and reputation.

Leveraging variation in the timing of CCSS adoption across states and differential exposure across birth cohorts, I apply a difference-indifferences framework to American Community Survey data to show that greater CCSS exposure increases wage income among young adults-particularly among female and nonwhite individuals. These gains are driven by increases in labor supply along the intensive margin and higher hourly wages, rather than by changes in educational attainment or labor force participation. Evidence from shifts in occupations, industries, and college degree fields suggests that the CCSS improved job sorting-away from low-wage, lowskill sectors and into roles requiring less physical abilities and more interpersonal skills.

Overall, fintech and big tech credit appear to complement rather than substitute conventional forms of lending.

It addresses the following question: what is the smallest viable floor area that supports sustained occupancy without persistent stress, conflict, or turnover? An integrative review method was employed, drawing from behavioural studies in environmental psychology, international regulatory standards, and real-world market data. The analysis focuses on essential domestic functions including sleep, hygiene, food preparation, storage, social interaction, and work. Quantitative findings from tenancy surveys, post-occupancy research, and market performance data indicate that residential units below 30 square metres for single occupants and 45 square metres for couples are consistently associated with reduced satisfaction and shorter tenancies.

This yields a non-monotonic U-shaped pattern: bank risk is low when stablecoin surplus is either small or very large, but peaks at intermediate levels.

This work investigates the impact of social comparison, in the form of player knockout (PK) events, on streamer performance in livestreaming platforms. The PK events create a public, competitive situation wherein streamers perform acts in real-time and compete for viewer support through virtual gifting. Meanwhile, streamers face a central trade-off on whether to join PK: potential risks like negative self-evaluation, public humiliation, and viewer disillusionment versus possible benefits like increased visibility, fans, and earnings. Analyzing granular data from a leading livestreaming platform, we report two empirical studies. In Study 1, we employ Double Machine Learning (DML) and find that, on average, streamers participating in PK events increase total gifting by over 300%, viewer engagement duration by over 70%, and significantly boost streamers' follower growth. In Study 2, we leverage the platform's randomly matched PK events to analyze how competition structure affects streamer outcomes. Interestingly, our results show that when facing with bigger opponents (streamers with relatively more followers), although streamers are more likely to 'lose' in PK, they still benefit substantially from increased gifting and follower growth. Specifically, competing against either bigger opponents or those in the same content category increases both total gifting and cross-streamer follower attraction for the focal streamer. Our further heterogeneity analysis reveals two optimal PK configurations: small streamers benefit most from competing against bigger, same-category opponents, while big streamers gain most from competing against bigger peers in different categories, in terms of gifting and follower dynamics. Our study adds to the social comparison theory by examining social comparison in a public, real-time, and multi-party setting, and extends the social exchange theory by conceptualizing and measuring two distinct types of social exchanges, namely, reputational social exchange (reflected by cross-streamer follower migration) alongside traditional monetary social exchange (reflected by gifting). Our findings also provide actionable insights for platforms operators and streamers on designing and refining competitive strategies for enhancing user engagement and monetization."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u76f4\u64ad\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2dPK\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u4e3b\u64ad\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0PK\u6d3b\u52a8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u793c\u7269\u6536\u5165\u3001\u89c2\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7c89\u4e1d\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7ade\u4e89\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "research_question": "PK\u6d3b\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u64ad\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u901a\u8fc7\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u529f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u53d8\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0cPK\u6d3b\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u793e\u4ea4\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e3b\u64ad\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4ea4\u6bd4\u8f83\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u6362\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DML\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5339\u914dPK\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "PK\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u793c\u7269\u6536\u5165300%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u89c2\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f470%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u7c89\u4e1d\uff1b\u7ade\u4e89\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u6bd4\u8f83\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u591a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u6362\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u4e3b\u64ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7ade\u4e89\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u53d8\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The paper concludes with recommendations for economic diversification, policy coordination, and regional integration as strategies for achieving long-term currency stability and sustainable development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u5916\u6c47\u50a8\u5907\u3001\u5168\u7403\u6cb9\u4ef7\u4e0e\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6cb9\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5916\u6c47\u50a8\u5907\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u5948\u62c9\u6c47\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u591a\u5143\u5316\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u534f\u8c03\u7b49\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u8d27\u5e01\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "research_question": "\u5168\u7403\u6cb9\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5916\u6c47\u50a8\u5907\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u6d32\u6700\u5927\u7684\u77f3\u6cb9\u51fa\u53e3\u56fd\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u6c47\u7387\u6781\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5916\u90e8\u51b2\u51fb\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5168\u7403\u77f3\u6cb9\u5e02\u573a\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6cb9\u4ef7\u3001\u5916\u6c47\u50a8\u5907\u4e0e\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u901a\u80c0\u3001\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u7b49\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u6cb9\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5916\u6c47\u50a8\u5907\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5948\u62c9\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u77f3\u6cb9\u51fa\u53e3\u56fd\u7684\u6c47\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u6c47\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u591a\u5143\u5316\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u533a\u57df\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7b49\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u957f\u671f\u8d27\u5e01\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We contribute to the current literature by clarifying two dimensions of the Russian economy: oil-macroeconomy and oil-macroeconomic policy. Moreover, we documented that the full model, which does not account for a structural break in 2014, fails to capture the accurate transmission responses of policy and real variables in the Russian context. Our empirical research provides the following insights: First, the Russian economy demonstrates effects of oil dependency throughout the entire period from 2005 to 2024. Second, crude oil positive revenues demonstrate a greater pro-inflationary impact after 2014. Third, Russian macroeconomic policy exhibits countercyclical features in the short and medium run after 2014, while monetary policy follows a procyclical pattern to crude oil revenue positive shocks before 2014. Fourth, tightening of monetary policy worsens the economic conditions in the short and medium run and exhibits a pro-inflationary impact throughout the whole period. Finally, after 2014, expansionary fiscal policy has had adverse effects on the Russian output with a higher pro-inflationary impact on the Economy.&nbsp;</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u539f\u6cb9\u6536\u5165\u6b63\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e862005-2013\u5e74\u548c2014-2024\u5e74\u4e24\u4e2a\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c2014\u5e74\u540e\u539f\u6cb9\u6536\u5165\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u57282014\u5e74\u540e\u5448\u73b0\u9006\u5468\u671f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "research_question": "\u539f\u6cb9\u6536\u5165\u6b63\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u660e\u786e\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u77f3\u6cb9\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u77f3\u6cb9\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4e2a\u65f6\u671f\uff082005-2013\u548c2014-2024\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "1. \u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u57282005-2024\u5e74\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u77f3\u6cb9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6548\u5e94\uff1b2. 2014\u5e74\u540e\u539f\u6cb9\u6536\u5165\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff1b3. 2014\u5e74\u540e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u5448\u73b0\u9006\u5468\u671f\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4. \u7d27\u7f29\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u6076\u5316\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u52a0\u5267\u901a\u80c0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77f3\u6cb9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f2014\u5e74\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u88c2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u77f3\u6cb9\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

These innovations, shaped by the evolving demands of gender justice, human rights, and constitutional values, reflect a transformative journey from customary practices to statutory reforms. This paper critically examines key legal innovations in Hindu law, focusing on the reform of personal laws and inheritance rights, particularly those affecting women. The paper will first explore landmark judicial decisions such as Shah Bano v. Union of India (1985) and Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997), which laid the foundation for gender justice within the framework of Hindu law. Further, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, which granted daughters equal rights to ancestral property, serves as a significant legal milestone in redefining inheritance rights in Hindu law. This paper will delve into the motivations behind these reforms, examining how the Indian judiciary and legislature have blended traditional legal principles with modern constitutional mandates to address gender inequality. The paper will also analyze challenges in reconciling Hindu law's traditional principles with contemporary human rights standards, especially in cases involving marital rights, divorce, and maintenance. As Hindu law continues to evolve, the paper will reflect on how these innovations contribute to a broader understanding of legal pluralism in Asia, highlighting the intersection of religion, law, and social justice. This paper aims to contribute to the discourse on how traditional legal systems can adapt to modern needs without losing their cultural and religious essence by providing a nuanced analysis of Hindu law's legal innovation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5728\u5f53\u4ee3\u5370\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6cd5\u5f8b\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u522b\u6b63\u4e49\u3001\u4eba\u6743\u548c\u5baa\u6cd5\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2a\u4eba\u6cd5\u548c\u7ee7\u627f\u6743\u7684\u6539\u9769\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5f53\u4ee3\u5370\u5ea6\u901a\u8fc7\u6cd5\u5f8b\u521b\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u522b\u6b63\u4e49\u548c\u7ee7\u627f\u6743\u7684\u5e73\u7b49\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u8df5\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3\u6539\u9769\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u4eba\u6743\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u4f20\u7edf\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\uff08\u5982\u300a\u6469\u5974\u6cd5\u5178\u300b\u548c\u300a\u6cd5\u8bba\u300b\uff09\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5baa\u6cd5\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u53f8\u6cd5\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u5982Shah Bano\u6848\u548cVishaka\u6848\uff09\u548c\u7acb\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\uff08\u59822005\u5e74\u300a\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u7ee7\u627f\u6cd5\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u300b\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6cd5\u5f8b\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u6cd5\u5f8b\u901a\u8fc7\u53f8\u6cd5\u548c\u7acb\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u9010\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u4f20\u7edf\u539f\u5219\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u6743\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b97\u6559\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5982\u4f55\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u4f20\u7edf\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6539\u9769\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u501f\u9274\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u7ee7\u627f\u6743\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Results indicate that food insecurity significantly reduces women\u2019s participation in livelihood decision-making and increases their workload, while paradoxically increasing their control over household income.

The research is guided by three primary objectives: First, to find whether a statistically significant wage gap remained between these two groups after controlling for standard human capital and demographic traits. Second, to assess whether the economic returns to education differed between migrant and non-migrant workers. Third, to analyze how any observed wage disparities affecting migrants varied across the distinct sectors of the Chilean economy. This research is based on recognized economic principles, including the Mincer earnings function, human capital theory, labor market discrimination theories, and segmented labor market theory. The methodology employed is a quantitative analysis utilizing data from the 2022 Chilean National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey (CASEN). A multivariate regression analysis on this dataset tested the declared hypotheses. The interpretation of the econometric results includes quantitative reasoning that correlates results with the theoretical framework, and it additionally takes into consideration the unique socioeconomic setting and predominant policy environment in Chile. Preliminary results indicate the presence of a significant wage gap favoring non-migrant workers, even after controlling for key factors. Moreover, the returns to education appear to be lower for migrant workers, and the magnitude of the wage disparity varies considerably across different economic sectors, with the financial and insurance activities sector showing a particularly pronounced wage disadvantage for migrants."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e862022\u5e74\u667a\u5229\u79fb\u6c11\u4e0e\u975e\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u63a7\u5236\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7279\u5f81\u540e\uff0c\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u4eba\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "research_question": "\u667a\u5229\u79fb\u6c11\u4e0e\u975e\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\uff1f\u6559\u80b2\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u662f\u5426\u56e0\u79fb\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u800c\u5f02\uff1f\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u667a\u5229\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Mincer\u6536\u76ca\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6b67\u89c6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5206\u5272\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e2022\u5e74\u667a\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u67e5\uff08CASEN\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5143\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u975e\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u4eba\u5de5\u8d44\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u4eba\uff1b\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u4eba\u6559\u80b2\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u4fdd\u9669\u884c\u4e1a\u5c24\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u5272\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u5f02\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u667a\u5229\u653f\u5e9c\u5236\u5b9a\u51cf\u5c11\u79fb\u6c11\u5de5\u4eba\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This chapter interrogates the evolving nature of corporate \"publicness,\" challenging binary frameworks that view listing and delisting as fixed states. It examines the systemic drivers behind the IPO drought and delisting wave-including regulatory burdens, macroeconomic volatility, and deep private capital pools-and critiques the EU Listing Act for failing to provide transitional mechanisms such as downlisting. Through analysis of direct listings, SPACs, and Regulation A+, the chapter highlights the fragmentation of market access pathways. It argues for a reconceptualization of publicness as a spectrum rather than a status, urging regulators to embrace lifecycle-based models that accommodate continuity, reversibility, and strategic modulation.

As AI technologies increasingly rely on large-scale text and data mining (TDM), the current UK legal environment risks deterring innovation and investment. Drawing on the government\u2019s consultation on AI and copyright, the paper advocates for a modernised TDM exception that includes a robust opt-out mechanism for rights holders.

It is found that from the three aspects of employment participation rate, income and working time, women who give birth to children, especially women who have more children after the second child policy is lifted, are at a disadvantage in the labor market. We constructed a mediating effect model from several dimensions, such as education and training and career promotion satisfaction, to understand the influence mechanism of fertility status on working conditions. It is concluded that an increase in the number of children reduces satisfaction with promotion and reducing education and training opportunities, thereby affecting working conditions and incomes. Through the study of DID model, from the perspective of the heterogeneity of two-child policy policy on working conditions, the effect of the two-child policy has a more obvious negative inhibitory effect on urban women&apos;s participation rate and on the working hours. The negative effect of the two-child policy on rural women&apos;s income is more obvious; The negative effect of the two-child policy on women&apos;s participation rate in eastern China is more obvious. The effect of the two-child policy on the working hours of women in eastern China is more obvious.

Elevating TFP\u00a0is essential for restructuring the agricultural economy and mitigating the excessive use of labor, fertilizers, and other resources, thereby establishing it as a cornerstone of sustainable agricultural development. Examining the interplay between such subsidies and TFP\u00a0yields valuable insights for promoting sustainable practices and advancing agricultural modernization.This research employs provincial data from China over the period 2011\u20132021, utilizing the AHP-SBM-DEA methodology to assess agricultural TFP in 30 regions. This article examines the impact of agricultural machinery subsidies on agricultural\u00a0TFP. There is a particular focus on the mediating effects of mechanised socialised services and land transfers. The empirical results indicate that these subsidies significantly enhance TFP over time, and their effects persist over time as well. We identify mechanized socialized services and land transfer as two critical mechanisms, with the former accounting for 28.25% of the total effect of subsidies on TFP. The findings emphasize the importance of promoting mechanized socialized services. Additionally, subsidy effects on agricultural total factor productivity are more pronounced in plain regions than in hilly regions.

A two-stage stochastic programming formulation is introduced to account for demand uncertainty for the end products. In the first stage, before demand is realized, decisions are made on the setup periods for both production and purchase, and their corresponding quantities. In the second stage, after demand is revealed, the inventory and lost sales decisions are made. The goal is to minimize the expected total cost incurred by the decisions made in both stages.

The analysis is based on the NEPSE daily closing index from July 20, 1997, to March 30, 2024. The main goal is to identify and understand the complexity and patterns in the stock market through multifractal structures. The generalized Hurst exponent h(q) shows a clear dependence on q, confirming that the NEPSE return series is multifractal. The Hurst exponent ranges from 0.903 for small fluctuations to 0.460 for large ones, indicating the presence of both long-term memory and short-term dependencies. The width of the multifractal spectrum is 1.146, and the difference in Hurst values (\u0394h=0.443) suggests strong multifractality. The capacity dimension D(0), information dimension D(1), and correlation dimension D(2) further support the complex structure of the market. The findings suggest that the Nepalese stock market is inefficient and behaves differently across time scales and fluctuations.

The gender pay gap has nearly halved for exporting firms since 1993 \u2014 a decline that is much smaller for non-exporting firms. Long-term exporters employ a large share of the workforce and drive trends across the entire sector. Some of the largest exporting industries, such as vehicle manufacturing, show the lowest gender pay gaps. I show that the decline in the gender pay gap of exporters is driven by the increasing representation of women in high-paying positions. Tracking the gender pay gap over the first 10 to 15 years of employees\u2019 careers reveals that this decline is largely due to a growing share of highly educated women in the workforce, along with stronger opportunities for career advancement for women.

Fine flavour cacao (FFC) may contribute to decommodifying the cacao sector. However, such decommodification may lead to new patterns of in- and exclusion among smallholder producers, depending on how well they are able to deal with more stringent requirements of post-harvesting, manufacturing and consuming FFCs. This study assesses the extent to which producers of two of Peru\u2019s premier FFCs match the requirements arising from processing and manufacturing FFCs. We interviewed 76 Peruvian and international FFC buyers and 337\u00a0cacao farmer households from 114 communities in Peru. We used ordination and cluster analysis to construct buyer and producer typologies, and we developed a methodology to assess how well each producer type matches the requirements of each buyer type. While certain producers are well positioned to comply with the demands of specific buyers, wide gaps remain for producers to benefit from FFC, notably those related to quality aspects of cacao beans, but also ecological and socio-economic considerations. If decommodification of cacao is to benefit vulnerable smallholder producers, institutions and trade relationships are needed that allow producers to increasingly meet the more stringent requirements of a diversified, high-quality cacao sector."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79d8\u9c81\u7cbe\u54c1\u53ef\u53ef\uff08FFC\uff09\u7684\u53bb\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u5bf9\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u90e8\u5206\u519c\u6237\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u4e70\u5bb6\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u519c\u6237\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u751f\u6001\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "research_question": "\u79d8\u9c81\u7cbe\u54c1\u53ef\u53ef\uff08FFC\uff09\u7684\u53bb\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u53d7\u76ca\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u53bb\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u53ef\u884c\u4e1a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u7684\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u6392\u65a5\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53bb\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5bf976\u540d\u79d8\u9c81\u548c\u56fd\u9645FFC\u4e70\u5bb6\u53ca337\u6237\u53ef\u53ef\u519c\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u4e70\u5bb6\u548c\u519c\u6237\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u3002", "findings": "\u90e8\u5206\u519c\u6237\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u4e70\u5bb6\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u751f\u6001\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53bb\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u969c\u788d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u5ea6\u548c\u8d38\u6613\u5173\u7cfb\u652f\u6301\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u6ee1\u8db3FFC\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53bb\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u7684\u666e\u60e0\u6027\u3002"}}

Drawing from the Strategic Niche Management (SNM) framework and the Mundane Circular Economy Policy (MCEP), the study explores how IGPA, as an intermediary actor, facilitates CE experimentation through protected spaces in schools and evolves across three phases: capacity building, implementation, and public dissemination. First, the study highlights the importance of intermediary actors in enabling circular transformations by coordinating actors, resources, and visions across spatial and institutional scales. Second, it demonstrates how IGPA\u2019s hybrid role\u2014simultaneously acting as a niche, process, and systemic intermediary\u2014supports critical SNM mechanisms such as expectation formation, social learning, and network-building within educational settings. Third, it argues that CE transitions in the Global South require rethinking the dominant technocentric and market-led paradigms by centring mundane, relational, and justice-oriented practices. IGPA\u2019s work reframes CE not merely as material loop closure but as a socio-cultural project rooted in moral imagination and grassroots knowledge. In doing so, it challenges assumptions of intermediary neutrality and offers a decolonial, practice-based vision for CE transitions that acknowledges diverse pathways emerging from everyday institutional contexts."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e2d\u4ecb\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff08CE\uff09\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5370\u5ea6\u5c3c\u897f\u4e9a\u7eff\u8272\u6821\u957f\u5956\uff08IGPA\uff09\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u52a8CE\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u4ecb\u89d2\u8272\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8349\u6839\u5021\u8bae\u4e2d\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6218\u7565\u5229\u57fa\u7ba1\u7406\uff08SNM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65e5\u5e38\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\uff08MCEP\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5IGPA\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u8bbe\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u4f20\u64ad\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "findings": "\u4e2d\u4ecb\u89d2\u8272\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u613f\u666f\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u63a8\u52a8CE\u8f6c\u578b\uff0cIGPA\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u89d2\u8272\u652f\u6301\u4e86SNM\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4e2d\u4ecb\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684CE\u8f6c\u578b\u613f\u666f\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u5357\u65b9\u7684CE\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8349\u6839\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Taking the cross-city M&A (mergers and acquisitions) of listed companies that have completed cross-city M&A from 2007 to 2022 as a sample, this paper examines the role of government debt governance in cross-city capital flows. The results show that the implementation of relevant debt governance policies can promote companies to participate in cross-city capital flows. Moreover, through mechanism analysis, it is found that reducing the negative impact of economic asymmetry and reducing the level of tax burden can achieve positive effects. In addition, the results of heterogeneity analysis show that the effect is more obvious in companies with low information transparency and companies with high financing constraints.

We examine quarterly data from 173 Brazilian banks spanning from March 2006 to March 2020, using three distinct proxies for oil price uncertainty: the Crude Oil ETF Volatility Index (OVX), the Oil Price Uncertainty Index (OPU), and Brent crude oil prices. Our findings indicate that Brazilian banks adjust their Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Capital Buffer (BUF) in response to oil price volatility. Notably, the Brent crude oil price prompts adjustments in capital reserves, particularly when prices surpass critical thresholds. The study also explores the interplay between domestic and external uncertainties, showing that oil price fluctuations remain a significant driver of financial risk even in the presence of domestic economic instability. Robustness tests, including subsample analyses based on Basel III implementation, confirm the persistence of these effects.

However, implementing V2G presents challenges, including potential limitations on user flexibility and the need for strong coordination among all involved parties. Previous research has quantified consumer preferences for unidirectional smart charging, revealing compensation needs, but studies on V2G-specific preferences remain scarce. This study analyses user intentions to enter a V2G agreement with an electricity provider and quantifies trade-offs for conditions of such an agreement across multiple European countries using stated preference experiments. Preferences vary significantly across countries and demographic groups.\u00a0 Individuals who can install a private charger, who primarily charge at work, drive daily, and report higher annual mileage, show greater intention to enter a V2G agreement.

The lack of a temporal dimension in such data hinders analysts from establishing causal relationships and understanding travel patterns over time, which are key to developing accurate analyses and forecasting tools. Studies aiming to capture choices over time are often limited by the poor availability of panel data, especially for long-term evaluations and in low- and middle-income countries, where, at best, repeated cross-sections are available. This paper applies a novel choice model structure based on latent classes (LC) to accommodate heterogeneity in mode choices over time when panel data is unavailable, exploiting four waves from a repeated cross-sectional dataset collected in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, between 2011 and 2023. Instead of modelling individual choices, we track the behaviour of groups of people over time. To do so, the data is spatially aggregated to link the waves and create a pseudo-panel at the zonal level. At the same time, modal market shares between pairs of origin-destination zones are modelled using a fractional multinomial logit (FMNL) kernel. The LC structure introduces temporal variations in preferences by allowing the zonal groups to switch classes over time, in contrast to traditional LC, where class membership is fixed. Our findings suggest that two main modality styles (i.e., classes) explain mode choices in Bogot\u00e1, with the first characterised by a lower value of time, and with a higher willingness to cycle and walk longer distances, while the other is more transit-oriented. We find that the probability of belonging to the first class increases over time; this is an insight that is made possible by the novel approach we put forward."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\uff08LC\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce2\u54e5\u59272011-2023\u5e74\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u6570\u636e\u521b\u5efa\u4f2a\u9762\u677f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6355\u6349\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u957f\u671f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6f5c\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff08LC\uff09\u548c\u5206\u6570\u591a\u9879\u5f0flogit\u6a21\u578b\uff08FMNL\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6ce2\u54e5\u59272011-2023\u5e74\u7684\u56db\u6ce2\u91cd\u590d\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u521b\u5efa\u4f2a\u9762\u677f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528FMNL\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LC\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u597d\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u6ce2\u54e5\u5927\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7c7b\u522b\uff1a\u4e00\u7c7b\u65f6\u95f4\u4ef7\u503c\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u6b65\u884c\u548c\u9a91\u884c\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u7c7b\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LC\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7c7b\u522b\u6210\u5458\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfLC\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce2\u54e5\u5927\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In particular, digital freight networks have enhanced the convenience and diversity of consumer spending by reducing costs, improving efficiency, and expanding service coverage. Based on digital freight platform data from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2020 to 2023, this paper constructs digital freight network indicators using complex network metrics, systematically revealing the impact and mechanisms of regional freight digital transformation on household consumption. The findings indicate that: (1) the development of the digital freight network has significantly improved overall household consumption in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; (2) the digital freight networks positively influence consumption by increasing residents\u2019 income and reducing logistics costs, with income acting as a mediating factor; (3) the impact of the digital freight network on consumption varies across cities, primarily boosting consumption in core cities, while its effect on peripheral cities remains limited. This leads to imbalanced regional consumption development and an underutilization of synergistic effects. The results have important policy implications, suggesting that to promote household consumption, efforts should be made to accelerate the construction of digital infrastructure, narrow regional disparities, and strengthen income-enhancing mechanisms, thereby maximizing the role of digital freight networks in driving consumption and fostering coordinated regional development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eac\u6d25\u5180\u5730\u533a2020-2023\u5e74\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u7f51\u7edc\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u8d27\u8fd0\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d88\u8d39\uff0c\u6536\u5165\u662f\u4e2d\u4ecb\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u57ce\u5e02\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eac\u6d25\u5180\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u6d88\u8d39\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u6d88\u8d39\u9a71\u52a8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5bf9\u91ca\u653e\u5c45\u6c11\u6d88\u8d39\u6f5c\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u672c\u589e\u6548\u548c\u6269\u5927\u670d\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d88\u8d39\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u6307\u6807\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u7f51\u7edc\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eac\u6d25\u5180\u5730\u533a2020-2023\u5e74\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u7f51\u7edc\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eac\u6d25\u5180\u5730\u533a\u5bb6\u5ead\u6d88\u8d39\uff0c\u6536\u5165\u662f\u4e2d\u4ecb\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u6548\u679c\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u57ce\u5e02\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5916\u56f4\u57ce\u5e02\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u533a\u57df\u6d88\u8d39\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u8fd0\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u6d88\u8d39\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u5305\u62ec\u52a0\u5feb\u6570\u5b57\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5efa\u8bbe\u3001\u7f29\u5c0f\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u589e\u6536\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6d88\u8d39\u548c\u533a\u57df\u534f\u8c03\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This study adopts a parametric estimation framework using time-series econometric models to estimate air travel demand elasticity with respect to seat capacity and airfare, based on monthly U.S. domestic OD-level panel data. The approach integrates time-series econometric techniques with structural demand modeling to capture both the concurrent effects of explanatory variables and temporal patterns such as trend and seasonality.

However, current SLB deployments in mobile energy storage systems (MESS) neither integrate investment planning nor accommodate real\u2011time scheduling under battery degradation and operational uncertainty. To this end, this paper proposes a method for deploying SLB in MESS that integrates investment planning with pre\u2011scheduling. First, a framework for deploying SLB within MESS is introduced. Additionally, to enhance the usability of SLB in MESS, a safe region concept is proposed, which considers the lifespan of SLB and is integrated into both the investment planning and pre-scheduling frameworks. Building upon this, a joint solution method combining distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and reinforcement learning (RL) is introduced, effectively bridging long-term investment planning with real-time scheduling. Comparative case studies suggest that SLB-based MESS can reduce the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) by approximately 11-24%, compared to the use of brand-new batteries. These results validate the effectiveness of our integrated investment planning and pre-scheduling approach."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u6295\u8d44\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u9884\u8c03\u5ea6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8c\u624b\u7535\u6c60\uff08SLB\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DRO\u4e0eRL\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7535\u6c60\u5bff\u547d\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u50a8\u80fd\u6210\u672c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MESS\uff09\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8c\u624b\u7535\u6c60\uff08SLB\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u6295\u8d44\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7535\u6c60\u9000\u5316\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e8c\u624b\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u518d\u5229\u7528\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53cc\u91cd\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u6574\u5408\u6295\u8d44\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff08DRO\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6295\u8d44\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9884\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u91c7\u7528DRO\u4e0eRL\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u8854\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "findings": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSLB\u7684MESS\u53ef\u5c06\u50a8\u80fd\u6210\u672c\uff08LCOS\uff09\u964d\u4f4e11-24%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5c06DRO\u4e0eRL\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u4e8eSLB\u90e8\u7f72\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3aSLB\u5728MESS\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u50a8\u80fd\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

The coastal regions of the Indian Sundarbans have faced various problems such as floods, storm surges, and land use changes, which are influenced by the area&apos;s environmental and socio-economic conditions. As a result, shrimp farmers in this coastal region encounter numerous vulnerabilities due to significant economic losses in the industry. The Socio-Economic Vulnerability Index (SEVI) has been utilized to assess the socio-economic status of shrimp farmers. Namkhana C.D. Block in the Indian Sundarbans was selected as the study area. This analysis compares the vulnerability of current shrimp farmers with that of former farmers. The average SEVI value indicates that former farmers (0.797) are more vulnerable than current farmers (0.701). Former farmers face heightened risks due to deteriorating conditions such as shifting rainfall and temperature patterns, proximity to rivers, low-lying land, and heavy dependence on market trends and available labor. Highly sensitive factors like declining water quality and reduced agricultural productivity have triggered a series of effects, including negative impacts on children&apos;s education and increased migration driven by financial stress and rising debt, which contribute to the growing socio-economic vulnerability of former farmers. Implementing standard management practices, scientific methods, and awareness programs can help shrimp farmers prevent failures. The government should implement policies to help recover from or manage the adverse conditions facing shrimp farming."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08SEVI\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u5b59\u5fb7\u5c14\u672c\u65af\u6cbf\u6d77\u5730\u533a\u867e\u519c\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u867e\u519c\u6bd4\u73b0\u867e\u519c\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u5ea6\u5b59\u5fb7\u5c14\u672c\u65af\u6cbf\u6d77\u5730\u533a\u867e\u519c\u4e0e\u524d\u867e\u519c\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6709\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6cbf\u6d77\u5730\u533a\u867e\u519c\u9762\u4e34\u73af\u5883\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u73af\u5883\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SEVI\u6307\u6570\u5bf9Namkhana C.D.

While these bases were critical to military operations throughout the campaigns, their post-mission use remains poorly understood. Following NATO\u2019s gradual withdrawal, many bases were transferred to Afghan authorities. Consequently, the country inherited extensive but underutilized military infrastructures that continue to shape its development. This paper examines the post-conflict spatial legacy of NATO\u2019s military bases, framing them as an under-examined form of urban development in conflict-affected regions. Through exploratory research, fieldwork, and case studies, it identifies key design factors \u2013 such as the absence of a defined future use or intended end-users \u2013 that limit the long-term utility value of these sites. The findings reveal that military-built environments pose significant long-term planning challenges, often leading to an undesirable legacy of abandoned or underutilized bases. These outcomes underscore the need to reassess current design practices and the adoption of strategies that align security objectives with long-term development goals. In response, this paper proposes a long-term planning approach, supported by two design concepts \u2013 \u201cEnd-State Planning\u201d which integrates civilian use from the outset and \u201cImpact Multiplier\u201d which embed local development needs into military base infrastructure. Together, these concepts offer a novel contribution to enhance the durability and post-mission utility value of bases in future deployments, ensuring these infrastructures contribute to, rather than hinder, post-conflict development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5317\u7ea6\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u540e\u9057\u7559\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u5730\u7684\u6218\u540e\u5229\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5317\u7ea6\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u540e\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u533a\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u56fd\u9645\u7a33\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u9057\u7559\u7684\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u957f\u671f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u51b2\u7a81\u540e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u51b2\u7a81\u540e\u57ce\u5e02\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u5b9e\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u672a\u6765\u7528\u9014\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u5e9f\u5f03\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u7ec8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u201d\u548c\u201c\u5f71\u54cd\u500d\u589e\u5668\u201d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u519b\u4e8b\u57fa\u5730\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u519b\u4e8b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u5730\u652f\u6301\u800c\u975e\u963b\u788d\u51b2\u7a81\u540e\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this report, we argue that such an evolution may not be natural. But, there is great value to facilitate such an evolution. One key aspect would be to bring 'commoning' as an agenda of human rights. Human rights instruments are typically seen as state's obligation to citizens. Where human rights violations are taking place, it is the state which is brought under the scanner. However, from this state-centered world view, we have arrived a state-decentered world after globalization. The global challenges posed today, namely inequality, climate change etc, also cant be dealt with through a state-centred old world view. On the other hand, commons have remained an alternative way of managing resources compared to private property arrangements and state-owned public property. Both in private property arrangements and public property arrangements, the worldview of state-centered prevails.

This study evaluates the environmental and economic performance of integrating carbon capture into the copper comminution process through a combined Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA). The improved scenario introduces a CO 2 pretreatment step into the grinding circuit and is benchmarked against a conventional baseline process. The LCA results show that integrating CO 2 pre-treatment into the comminution process reduces grinding energy consumption from 3.1 to 2.6 kWh per kg copper. Combined with the embodied carbon emissions of the carbon capture system, the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction remains at 0.88-1.04 kg CO 2-eq per kg copper. From an economic perspective, the techno-economic analysis (TEA) indicates a unit cost saving of $0.12 per kg copper, corresponding to a 22.03-22.04% reduction in total grinding costs.

To the extent that parameter risk is correlated with systematic risk driving the bank\u2019s wider portfolio, capital for loans should be increased. Securitisation capital, which depends on pool capital, should, in turn, be higher as well.</p>\n<p>Parameter risk does not justify boosting securitisation capital for all the tranches in a deal beyond the level implied by prudent calculation of pool capital. It, therefore, does not provide an argument for deviations from capital neutrality under which the capital for all the tranches in a securitisation should equal that for the securitisation loan pool. (Reasons for non-neutrality includes the presence of agency costs created in complex, multi-agent securitisation processes.)</p>\n<p>We believe that the Basel Committee allowed for parameter input risk in its original calibration of the Basel II capital risk weights for on-balance-sheet loans. Those involved in the calibration of Basel II were clearly aware that the correlation parameters employed in the Basel II risk weight functions were higher than those implied by statistical analysis of bank loan default data.</p>\n<p>Our analysis shows that except where parameter risk implies higher pool capital, the impact on securitisation capital is relatively small. In particular, if parameter risk is correlated with intra-pool risk factors but is not systemic, then it justifies some limited shifting of capital towards more senior tranches. One might note that, if this latter type of parameter risk is present, the case for deduction of thin tranches attaching just below pool capital (a misguided and unjustified feature of current and proposed regulations) is even weaker.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8fdd\u7ea6\u6982\u7387\u98ce\u9669\u7eb3\u5165\u8bc1\u5238\u5316\u8d44\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u968f\u673a\u56e0\u7d20\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f93\u5165\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d37\u6b3e\u6c60\u7684\u8fdd\u7ea6\u6982\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u201c\u53c2\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u201d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8bc1\u5238\u5316\u8d44\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u8fdd\u7ea6\u6982\u7387\u98ce\u9669\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u8d44\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d37\u6b3e\u6c60\u8fdd\u7ea6\u6982\u7387\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u8d44\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u968f\u673a\u56e0\u7d20\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f93\u5165\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u8d44\u4ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u53c2\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bc1\u5238\u5316\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u5176\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u8d44\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u8bc1\u5238\u5316\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u8d37\u6b3e\u6c60\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

For a multiproduct firm, the data generated by one product will often have spillover benefits on the firm's other AI-enabled products, increasing their quality. This presumptively benefits consumers and may encourage procompetitive coordination between complementary products or data sources. But these data spillovers also bolster incentives for anticompetitive leveraging strategies (e.g. tying), because excluding rivals in one market will indirectly raise the firm's profits in other markets as well. As a result, the spread of AI is likely to increase the prevalence and complexity of leveraging strategies in digital markets. This poses a challenge to American antitrust, whose treatment of leveraging conduct is fragmented across numerous doctrines, some of which are antiquated and economically unsound."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u4ed6AI\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6fc0\u52b1\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u642d\u552e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "research_question": "AI\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6570\u636e\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u642d\u552e\uff09\u3001\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AI\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u3002", "findings": "AI\u6280\u672f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6b64\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8c03\u6574\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

In addition to these funds, Aceh is endowed with abundant natural resources, which are expected to contribute to poverty alleviation and economic development. Nevertheless, Aceh continues to record one of the highest poverty rates in Indonesia. This study aims to empirically examine the direct and indirect effects of Special Autonomy Funds (DOK) and Natural Resource Revenue-Sharing Funds (DBHSDA) on poverty levels through the mediating role of economic growth in the regencies and municipalities of Aceh Province from 2017 to 2021. Using secondary data, this research applies panel data regression employing Fixed Effect and Random Effect Models-and path analysis to evaluate the hypothesized relationships. The results indicate that DOK has a positive and significant effect on economic growth but also a paradoxical positive effect on poverty, suggesting that the benefits of growth generated by DOK are not sufficiently inclusive. Economic growth is proven to significantly mediate the relationship between DOK and poverty, yet its indirect effect also tends to increase poverty levels. Meanwhile, DBHSDA shows no significant effect on either economic growth or poverty reduction, directly or indirectly, largely due to its relatively small size and unequal distribution among districts. These findings highlight the need for more strategic and equitable fund management, including stronger targeting of poverty alleviation programs and improved coordination between fiscal decentralization policies and inclusive development initiatives."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e9a\u9f50\u7701\u7279\u6b8a\u81ea\u6cbb\u57fa\u91d1\uff08DOK\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u6536\u76ca\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u91d1\uff08DBHSDA\uff09\u5bf9\u8d2b\u56f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DOK\u867d\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8d2b\uff0c\u800cDBHSDA\u5219\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "research_question": "\u7279\u6b8a\u81ea\u6cbb\u57fa\u91d1\uff08DOK\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u6536\u76ca\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u91d1\uff08DBHSDA\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u4e9a\u9f50\u7701\u7684\u8d2b\u56f0\u6c34\u5e73\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e9a\u9f50\u7701\u62e5\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u81ea\u6cbb\u57fa\u91d1\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u8d2b\u56f0\u7387\u4ecd\u5c45\u9ad8\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d22\u653f\u5206\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u8d2b\u56f0\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282017-2021\u5e74\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "DOK\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u4f46\u95f4\u63a5\u52a0\u5267\u8d2b\u56f0\uff1bDBHSDA\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u51cf\u8d2b\u5747\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d22\u653f\u5206\u6743\u8d44\u91d1\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u51cf\u8d2b\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u51cf\u8d2b\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u3002"}}

We study both the internal governance mechanisms (boards of directors, incentive contracts) and external mechanisms (market for corporate control, government oversight), with particular focus on the latter. Nonprofit boards are unusually large, include employee directors, exhibit less industry expertise among outside directors, and face weak external oversight. CEO pay and turnover are largely unresponsive to non-financial metrics such as quality or charity provision. The disciplinary role of the market for corporate control is also weaker in the nonprofit sector: nonprofits with poor financial performance are half as likely to be acquired or closed as for-profits, and weak performance on non-financial metrics has no effect on acquisitions or closures. Using time-series and cross-sectional variation in state oversight of nonprofits, we find that oversight strength explains a substantial portion of the gap in takeover rates between for-profits and nonprofits.

At its core, the AI Act is structured on Europe\u2019s product safety regime. It is aimed at governing AI systems through assigning them into risk tiers, and deploying bans, risk regulation, and self-regulation.

This behavior allows agents to attribute failures to self-imposed obstacles rather than to a lack of competence. Psychologists refer to this phenomenon as self-handicapping. In this paper, I model rational agents with preferences for self-esteem. This allows me to provide sufficient conditions under which these self-esteem concerned agents engage in rational self-handicapping behavior. I then consider the effects of self-esteem concerned agents in two policy relevant applications: education and tournaments. In education, designing an exam with noisier questions results in more studying by self-handicappers without discouraging other students. In tournaments, policies aimed at encouraging a particular group to show up to job interviews can result in strategic adjustment by the targeted group leading to lower overall attendance by that group."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u5c0a\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8bbe\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7ade\u8d5b\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u81ea\u5c0a\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u4f55\u65f6\u4f1a\u7406\u6027\u5730\u91c7\u53d6\u81ea\u6211\u8bbe\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8bbe\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u81ea\u5c0a\u5fc3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u9762\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u81ea\u5c0a\u5fc3\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7ade\u8d5b\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "findings": "\u81ea\u5c0a\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u4f1a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7406\u6027\u5730\u81ea\u6211\u8bbe\u969c\uff1b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u8003\u8bd5\u80fd\u6fc0\u52b1\u81ea\u6211\u8bbe\u969c\u8005\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5728\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u7fa4\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6574\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u81ea\u5c0a\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8bbe\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7ade\u8d5b\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Using a uniquely compiled dataset, we identify key factors influencing household electricity demand at the utility scale. We find that higher electricity rates and percent of adults with higher education are consistently associated with lower household consumption, while larger home sizes, use of electric heating, and higher income levels correspond to greater usage. Offerings of electric vehicle (EV) incentive programs are significantly linked to increased household electricity demand, even after controlling for the density of public EV charging infrastructure, suggesting their effectiveness in encouraging EV adoption and at-home charging. In contrast, the offerings of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs show no clear association with average electricity consumption. Utilities serving rural areas or governed as cooperatives tend to exhibit higher per-household electricity use, although these differences diminish when accounting for program availability and demographic variables. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating utility governance, program design, and pricing strategies to support equitable and efficient energy transitions, particularly in regions facing high energy burdens."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u5357\u90e8\u4e54\u6cbb\u4e9a\u5dde\u548c\u5317\u5361\u7f57\u6765\u7eb3\u5dde\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u5404\u79cd\u80fd\u6e90\u6fc0\u52b1\u8ba1\u5212\uff09\u4e0e\u5c45\u6c11\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7528\u7535\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u623f\u5c4b\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u7535\u6696\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u8f83\u9ad8\u7528\u7535\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u6fc0\u52b1\u8ba1\u5212\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u7535\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u8ba1\u5212\u5219\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5173\u8054\u3002", "research_question": "\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5c45\u6c11\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5f71\u54cd\u5bb6\u5ead\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5c45\u6c11\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7279\u7f16\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u5357\u90e8100\u591a\u5bb6\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7528\u7535\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u623f\u5c4b\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u7535\u6696\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u8f83\u9ad8\u7528\u7535\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u6fc0\u52b1\u8ba1\u5212\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u7535\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

This review explores blockchain's applications in tourism, including secure booking systems, digital identity verification, loyalty programs, and sustainability tracking. By reducing intermediaries and improving trust, blockchain can streamline operations and meet consumer demand for ethical practices. However, the technology's adoption faces challenges such as technical scalability, high costs, regulatory uncertainties, and industry resistance. Current research frameworks, such as the Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Planned Behavior, help to analyze factors influencing adoption, while quantitative and qualitative methodologies provide insights into stakeholder perspectives. Future opportunities for blockchain in tourism include integration with IoT and AI, establishing universal standards, and fostering consumer education. Addressing these challenges and seizing new opportunities can position blockchain as a foundational technology, supporting a more resilient, sustainable, and customer-centric tourism industry."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u6b63\u5728\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u4e2d\u5d2d\u9732\u5934\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5728\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b89\u5168\u9884\u8ba2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u4ecb\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u8425\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u91c7\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u963b\u529b\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff09\u5e2e\u52a9\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u672a\u6765\u673a\u4f1a\u5305\u62ec\u4e0e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6559\u80b2\u3002\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u6293\u4f4f\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u4ee5\u5ba2\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6280\u672f\u3002", "research_question": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1f", "motivation": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u91cd\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\uff08TAM\uff09\u3001\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff08TPB\uff09", "method": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5", "findings": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5728\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5305\u62ec\u5b89\u5168\u9884\u8ba2\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TAM\u548cTPB\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u4ecb\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

I develop a novel measure of temperature shocks based on isolating extreme observations and conduct two empirical exercises. First, I estimate the global average impact of temperature shocks on commodity import prices disaggregated by raw materials and food. The country panel results show a sustained increase in prices, providing evidence of a new channel of temperature-induced imported inflation from commodities. Second, I show how foreign temperature shocks can weigh on import and domestic prices for the U.S. and key European economies. Temperature shock effects extend beyond a country's own borders, with a 1.7% peak increase in import prices in the U.S. Cross-border temperature spillovers also translate into higher producer price inflation (+0.9%), whereas the pass-through to consumer prices is more limited (+0.4%). Finally, I uncover asymmetries in the responses to the signs of the shock. Positive temperature shocks (heat waves) have larger short-term inflationary effects, affecting import prices more, while negative shocks (cold spells) are more pronounced for domestic inflation in the medium term. These findings highlight how the effects of extreme temperatures can be transmitted internationally through commodity markets, revealing unexpected sources of domestic inflation that challenge economies and central banks in maintaining price stability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u7269\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u8fdb\u53e3\u5546\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u56fd\u5185\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u8861\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u5546\u54c1\u8fdb\u53e3\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u56fd\u5185\u901a\u80c0\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5546\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u4f20\u5bfc\u81f3\u8fdb\u53e3\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u56fd\u5185\u4ef7\u683c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6781\u7aef\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u5546\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u8861\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fdb\u53e3\u4ef7\u683c\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\uff08\u7f8e\u56fd\u5cf0\u503c1.7%\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u4ef7\u683c\u901a\u80c0\u589e\u52a0\uff08+0.9%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4ef7\u683c\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff08+0.4%\uff09\u3002\u6b63\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\uff08\u70ed\u6d6a\uff09\u77ed\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u8d1f\u51b2\u51fb\uff08\u5bd2\u6f6e\uff09\u5bf9\u4e2d\u671f\u56fd\u5185\u901a\u80c0\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u5546\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u8de8\u56fd\u4f20\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u592e\u884c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u901a\u80c0\u538b\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We performed a vast data collection on spectrum holdings and fees paid by close to 250 operators in nearly 100 countries. Mobile spectrum has increased consistently across all regions, driven by the rollout of 4G and 5G networks. Despite the enhanced functionality, average revenues per user have declined. These fundamentals have reduced the value of spectrum from the perspective of operators, and spectrum unit prices have declined in recent years. However, the overall cost of spectrum as a proportion of recurring revenue (the cost-to-revenue ratio) has increased, globally averaging 7.4% in 2023, up from 4.4% in 2014. This cost varies significantly across countries, from as little as 1% and up to 25% of operators' revenues. We attribute such vast differences in spectrum cost to different approaches taken by regulators and market dynamics. Through econometric analysis, we find that higher spectrum cost slows down network deployment and quality, with 10 pp higher spectrum cost to revenue ratio reducing network coverage by up to 2%, and reducing network speeds by up to 8%. On the other hand, we affirm positive impacts of making sufficient spectrum available, with 10% increase in available spectrum increasing network speeds by up to 3.8%. These findings point to spectrum policy as a key driver of network deployment strategies and infrastructure quality. Given the vast evidence on the economic benefits of connectivity, regulators should consider how pricing and timely release can maximise the benefits of spectrum to society."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e862014\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u95f4\u9891\u8c31\u83b7\u53d6\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\uff08MNOs\uff09\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8fd1100\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea6250\u5bb6\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6301\u6709\u91cf\u548c\u8d39\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba14G\u548c5G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u63a8\u51fa\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u5e73\u5747\u6536\u5165\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u5355\u4f4d\u4ef7\u683c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u6210\u672c\u5360\u6536\u5165\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ece2014\u5e74\u76844.4%\u4e0a\u5347\u81f32023\u5e74\u76847.4%\uff0c\u4e14\u5404\u56fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff081%-25%\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6210\u672c\u4f1a\u51cf\u7f13\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5219\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u9891\u8c31\u653f\u7b56\u662f\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u9891\u8c31\u83b7\u53d6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9891\u8c31\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u9891\u8c31\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8fd1100\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea6250\u5bb6\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u9891\u8c31\u6210\u672c\u5360\u6536\u5165\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u7f13\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5145\u8db3\u9891\u8c31\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9891\u8c31\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f18\u5316\u9891\u8c31\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u673a\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

As financial markets become increasingly complex, traditional forecasting methods often fall short in providing transparent insights into their predictions. This study proposes a hybrid framework that combines advanced machine learning algorithms with XAI methodologies, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). By applying these techniques to various time series datasets, including stock prices and commodity markets, we assess the impact of explainability on user trust and decision-making efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that integrating XAI not only improves the interpretability of predictions but also enhances the overall accuracy of forecasting models. Insights from user surveys further reveal that increased transparency leads to greater confidence in AI-driven decisions. The findings underscore the importance of explainability in financial forecasting, advocating for its adoption to bridge the gap between complex AI systems and user comprehension."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0eXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SHAP\u548cLIME\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982SHAP\u548cLIME\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0eXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u80a1\u7968\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u5546\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "findings": "\u96c6\u6210XAI\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5bf9AI\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u589e\u5f3aAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

This chapter retraces the evolution of the legal status of the public domain in copyright. Starting from the history of the notion of public domain and its presence, or rather absence, in copyright law, it insists on the precarity of the public domain as it does not receive any positive protection by law, lacks legal standing and is vulnerable to extension of copyright duration, as well as to other forms of reservation.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, recent legal changes have sought to prohibit some enclosures of the public domain, notably the article 14 of the EU directive 2019/790 that rejects protection of reproductions of works of visual art whose copyright has expired, or the <i>Vigeland</i> decision of the EFTA Court that considered that the registration of a trademark in a public domain work could contradict public order. This emerging protection of public domain is encouraging though still very timid and incomplete, if one does not change its perception as a negative concept, as what is <i>not</i> protected by law. A more robust protection of public domain would need a reconceptualization of copyright into a more inclusive, relational and cultural model, instead of a strictly proprietarian and exclusivity-based paradigm. Within such a revised regime, allocating rights, privileges, entitlements and freedoms in creative resources and their many inputs to the cultural public sphere, public domain could be seen as a valuable cultural practice and be conferred some legal standing, in the form of collective and inclusive entitlements.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u5728\u7248\u6743\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5730\u4f4d\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u79ef\u6781\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u671f\u9650\u5ef6\u957f\u7b49\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd1\u671f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u53d8\u5316\u8bd5\u56fe\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4fb5\u5360\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ecd\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u7248\u6743\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e76\u8d4b\u4e88\u5176\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "research_question": "\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u5728\u7248\u6743\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5730\u4f4d\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\uff1f\u5176\u4fdd\u62a4\u73b0\u72b6\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u5728\u7248\u6743\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u79ef\u6781\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u4fb5\u5360\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5730\u4f4d\u53ca\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7248\u6743\u6cd5\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u6587\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u7248\u6743\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u8d4b\u4e88\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a0\u5f3a\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

While previous research has highlighted the positive role of workplace training in enhancing productivity, we extend this literature by exploring how investments in training interact with other intangible assets such as software and data bases, innovation property, brand, and organizational capital. Using data from the EUKLEMS &amp; INTANProd databases covering 17 industries across 27 EU countries, the UK, and the US between 1995 and 2021, we employ a difference-indifferences estimation approach within a production function framework augmented to include intangible capital. Our findings reveal that training significantly boosts labour productivity, with the effect being stronger in industries with higher training investment intensity. We also demonstrate that the complementarity between training and other intangible capital is most pronounced in business services and is mainly explained by the interaction between training and other firmspecific intangible assets such as branding and organisational capital."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u804c\u57f9\u8bad\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u57f9\u8bad\u8d44\u672c\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u672c\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57f9\u8bad\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52b3\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u57f9\u8bad\u6295\u8d44\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1\u884c\u4e1a\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8d44\u672c\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5b9a\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u804c\u57f9\u8bad\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u52b3\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff1f\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u672c\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u804c\u573a\u57f9\u8bad\u5bf9\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u672c\uff08\u5982\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u4ea7\u6743\u3001\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8d44\u672c\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u51fd\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u672c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u57f9\u8bad\u8d44\u672c\u79ef\u7d2f\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EUKLEMS & INTANProd\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff081995-2021\u5e74\uff0c\u6db5\u76d627\u4e2a\u6b27\u76df\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u82f1\u56fd\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u768417\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "findings": "\u57f9\u8bad\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52b3\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u57f9\u8bad\u6295\u8d44\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1\u884c\u4e1a\u6700\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e0e\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u5f62\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f18\u5316\u57f9\u8bad\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u503c\u5f97\u5173\u6ce8\u3002"}}

Little is known about the extent to which this transformation affects the way microfinance institutions (MFIs) conduct their business. Our results obtained by applying an event study methodology to 66 transformed MFIs suggest that portfolio yield is driven down by 3.9 percentage points due to transformation, indicating that clients get more favorable interest rates. MFIs are able to significantly cut down their operational expenses, of which 1.1 percentage points can be attributed to transformation. Other findings include a steep increase in commercial debt leverage and deposits, a significant decrease in the fluctuation of funding costs and a sharp rise in average loan size, often taken as an indicator for mission drift. Profitability in terms of ROA drops in the short term, while ROE is driven up in the medium to long run, suggesting a more shareholder-oriented attitude."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u578b\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\uff08MFIs\uff09\u4eceNGO\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u80a1\u4e1c\u6240\u6709\u5236\u540e\uff0c\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u7387\u4e0b\u964d3.9%\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e1.1%\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u503a\u52a1\u6760\u6746\u548c\u5b58\u6b3e\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8d37\u6b3e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u77ed\u671fROA\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u4e2d\u957f\u671fROE\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "research_question": "\u5fae\u578b\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u4eceNGO\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u80a1\u4e1c\u6240\u6709\u5236\u540e\uff0c\u5176\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fd0\u8425\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u54ea\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u673a\u6784\u8f6c\u578b\u5bf9\u5fae\u578b\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u4e1a\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u8f6c\u578b\u5bf9MFIs\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf966\u5bb6\u8f6c\u578b\u7684MFIs\u5e94\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u8f6c\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u7387\u4e0b\u964d3.9%\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e1.1%\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u503a\u52a1\u6760\u6746\u548c\u5b58\u6b3e\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8d37\u6b3e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u77ed\u671fROA\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u4e2d\u957f\u671fROE\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u6784\u8f6c\u578b\u5bf9MFIs\u4e1a\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548cMFIs\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f6c\u578b\u540e\u4e1a\u52a1\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

The test serves as a universal yardstick for assessing the compatibility of domestic copyright exceptions with international copyright law. However, it is doubtful whether the international three-step test is applicable at all. Arguably, TDM copies fall outside the scope of the international right of reproduction and go beyond the ambit of the test's operation. Only if national or regional copyright legislation declares the test applicable, the question arises whether copyright exceptions supporting TDM for AI training constitute certain special cases that do not conflict with a work's normal exploitation and do not unreasonably prejudice legitimate author or rightsholder interests. As the analysis demonstrates, rules permitting TDM for AI training can satisfy all test criteria. An opt-out opportunity for copyright owners bans the risk of a conflict with a work's normal exploitation and an unreasonable prejudice from the outset.

This transformation is still at the very beginning and it is unclear where it will come. The purpose of this paper is to consider possible directions of the transformation. This is not an attempt at forecasting, but an analysis of potential scenarios with assessments of the feasibility of their implementation. We are discussing a range of possible paths for transforming the international monetary system. One end of the range is the creation of a single supranational currency based on the reformation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR). The other end is the disintegration of the single currency system, which is partly already underway. In between is a return to the gold standard and the displacement of the US dollar by renminbi.

One primary governance issue relates to the legal form used to perform microfinance activities. The sector deploys various forms including Banks, Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Cooperatives and NGOs, but each of them has unique features that lead to different orders of priorities and to distinct structures and mechanisms to pursue such a dual objective. This study compares the board governance model and the performance of cooperative organizations (COOPs) with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in microfinance. Using data on 352 rated microfinance institutions, the test results show that, compared to NGOs, COOPs have larger boards and a higher number of board meetings. However, NGOs have a greater percentage of international board members. The test on performance reveals that, whereas COOPs are more cost-efficient and charge lower interest rates, NGOs generally perform better in terms of social performance. However, the two organizational types do not perform differently in terms of profitability.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\uff08COOPs\uff09\u4e0e\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08NGOs\uff09\u5728\u5fae\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCOOPs\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u4f1a\u8bae\u66f4\u591a\uff0c\u800cNGOs\u56fd\u9645\u8463\u4e8b\u6bd4\u4f8b\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002COOPs\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u5229\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0cNGOs\u793e\u4f1a\u7ee9\u6548\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u4e0e\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u5fae\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u6709\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5fae\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6cbb\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u4f7f\u547d\u4e0e\u8d22\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e352\u5bb6\u8bc4\u7ea7\u5fae\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "COOPs\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u4f1a\u8bae\u66f4\u591a\uff1bNGOs\u56fd\u9645\u8463\u4e8b\u6bd4\u4f8b\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002COOPs\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u5229\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0cNGOs\u793e\u4f1a\u7ee9\u6548\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5fae\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u6cbb\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ee9\u6548\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5fae\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6cbb\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

In the baeKKim model, citizens delegate their freedom to the state as 'freedom as duty,' and the state functions as a sole reasoning entity that uses this delegated freedom as a resource to maximize overall social welfare. This paper defines the respective utility functions for citizens and the state. It analyzes the state's social welfare maximization problem using Lagrangian optimization, subject to the participation constraint that for a citizen to maintain delegation, the indirect utility gained through the state must be greater than the direct utility from acting independently.</p>\n<p>The analysis reveals that 'freedom as right'\u2014the indirect freedom redistributed by the state\u2014has a zero-sum structure and inevitably reaches a state of Pareto optimality. Furthermore, 'delegation exit,' where a citizen withdraws delegation, is categorized into 'simple exit' and 'exit with new delegation,' with the latter identified as an effective means of exerting competitive pressure on the state. The existence of 'multiple governments,' which enables such re-delegation, is highlighted as a key institutional condition that makes delegation exit a realistic option.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this study argues that the legitimacy of elitist democracy is founded on the voluntary delegation of citizens. This legitimacy is secured through the institutional guarantee of paths for delegation exit and re-delegation, as well as the transparent establishment of the social welfare function's values. The model's analysis provides concrete institutional design principles and policy implications for elitist democracy to become a rational and stable form of governance that promotes citizens' freedom and welfare.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7baeKKim\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u793e\u4f1a\u5951\u7ea6\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u8bfb\u516c\u6c11\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u516c\u6c11\u81ea\u7531\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u56fd\u5bb6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u2018\u4e49\u52a1\u81ea\u7531\u2019\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u7406\u6027\u5b9e\u4f53\u6700\u5927\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u2018\u6743\u5229\u81ea\u7531\u2019\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u9000\u51fa\u59d4\u6258\u5206\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u9000\u51fa\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u59d4\u6258\u9000\u51fa\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u5f62\u6210\u7ade\u4e89\u538b\u529b\u3002\u591a\u653f\u5e9c\u5b58\u5728\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u59d4\u6258\u9000\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5236\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u793e\u4f1a\u5951\u7ea6\u89d2\u5ea6\u901a\u8fc7baeKKim\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u516c\u6c11\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7cbe\u82f1\u6c11\u4e3b\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u516c\u6c11\u81ea\u7531\u59d4\u6258\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u82f1\u6c11\u4e3b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4f1a\u5951\u7ea6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u59d4\u6258\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u3001\u7cbe\u82f1\u6c11\u4e3b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7baeKKim\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u516c\u6c11\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "findings": "\u2018\u6743\u5229\u81ea\u7531\u2019\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u59d4\u6258\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u9000\u51fa\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u59d4\u6258\u9000\u51fa\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u5f62\u6210\u7ade\u4e89\u538b\u529b\uff1b\u591a\u653f\u5e9c\u5b58\u5728\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u59d4\u6258\u9000\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7cbe\u82f1\u6c11\u4e3b\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u59d4\u6258\u9000\u51fa\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cbe\u82f1\u6c11\u4e3b\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u6c11\u81ea\u7531\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002"}}

Traditional studies highlight information costs, transaction costs, and stigma, which we refer to as \"participation costs\" as main factors for under-enrollment. We extend this perspective by evaluating the impact of private-sector providers and third-party outreach partners on participation rates. Our analysis focuses on the $14.2 billion Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which was aimed at increasing broadband adoption among low-income households. Using novel county-level data, we examine program take-rates and confirm the significance of not only traditional participation costs but also demonstrate the ability of local government capacity and private-sector engagement with the ACP to enhance county-level take-rates. These results underscore the importance of federal-local and public-private partnerships as effective policy tools for improving means-tested program success. Our results also fail to identify an FCC grants program, which was designed to stimulate ACP participation, as effective. We explore the possible reasons for this outcome."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u672a\u5145\u5206\u53c2\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u79c1\u8425\u90e8\u95e8\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5bf9\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5ACP\u9879\u76ee\u4e3a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u5e9c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u79c1\u8425\u90e8\u95e8\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8bb8\u591a\u7b26\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u672a\u53c2\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u51b5\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u9879\u76ee\uff1f\u79c1\u8425\u90e8\u95e8\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u662f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u79c1\u8425\u90e8\u95e8\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6c61\u540d\u5316\uff09\u3001\u516c\u79c1\u5408\u4f5c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53bf\u4e00\u7ea7\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790ACP\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u5e9c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u79c1\u8425\u90e8\u95e8\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u5e9c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u79c1\u8425\u90e8\u95e8\u53c2\u4e0e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86ACP\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46FCC\u8d44\u52a9\u8ba1\u5212\u672a\u663e\u793a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u516c\u79c1\u5408\u4f5c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u793e\u4f1a\u9879\u76ee\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8054\u90a6-\u5730\u65b9\u548c\u516c\u79c1\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u51b5\u8c03\u67e5\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

However, this paper argues that the empirical and theoretical relevance of price stickiness has diminished. Drawing on both micro and macro evidence, I document the increasing frequency of price adjustments, the rise of e-commerce and dynamic pricing, I document the growing role of information frictions and wage stickiness in driving real rigidities. The shift away from sticky price models toward frameworks emphasizing sticky wages or informational and behavioral frictions challenges the centrality of menu costs in modern macroeconomics.

We measure employer concentration over mobility-adjusted labor markets: clusters of local occupations identified through asymmetric mobility patterns (using new, highly granular data on occupational mobility from 16 million resumes). We find that increased employer concentration causally reduces wages: moving from the median to the 95th percentile of employer concentration as experienced by workers lowers wages by 4 log points. Overall, we estimate that more than one in six U.S. workers face wage suppression of 2.5% or more as a result of above-median employer concentration. The effects of employer concentration are particularly pronounced in healthcare occupations."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u5168\u56fd\u62db\u8058\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u96c7\u4e3b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5de5\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u96c7\u4e3b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5de5\u8d44\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "research_question": "\u96c7\u4e3b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u5de5\u8d44\u6c34\u5e73\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u96c7\u4e3b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5de5\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u96c7\u4e3b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5de5\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u5168\u56fd\u62db\u8058\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u54081600\u4e07\u4efd\u7b80\u5386\u4e2d\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u96c7\u4e3b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5de5\u8d44\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u884c\u4e1a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u96c7\u4e3b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5de5\u8d44\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Using a dataset comprising 45,000 tweets collected over the year 2023, the research examines hashtag frequency, co-occurrence networks, sentiment distribution, source types, language usage, and platform access. The findings reveal that #indianrailways dominates the conversation, followed by employment-related hashtags such as #railwaynewrojgardo, which exhibit high negative sentiment, indicating public dissatisfaction regarding job opportunities. In contrast, tourism-related hashtags like #CharDhamYatra generate higher engagement and more neutral to positive sentiment. Analysis also shows that Twitter is primarily accessed through mobile devices, with most tweets originating from Android platforms and composed in English or Hinglish. The study further highlights the significant role of public-generated content in driving discussions on recruitment, services, and passenger grievances. By integrating sentiment analysis and co-occurrence mapping, this research provides actionable insights for enhancing Indian Railways' digital communication strategies and improving public service responsiveness through social media.

Data extraction focused on principles, processes, governance, legal aspects, and implementation strategies. Four core theoretical frameworks-Institutional Theory, Regulatory Governance, Ethics of Care, and Implementation Science-were applied to analyse the extracted data. The analysis involved thematic coding, cross-country comparison through each theoretical lens, and synthesis to identify trade-offs and inform a refined hybrid model.<br><br>Result: Australia's framework, embedded in national safety standards, emphasizes systemwide governance and accreditation, offering flexibility but risking implementation variability. New Zealand's model, legally mandated under consumer rights legislation, prioritizes individual accountability and patient rights, ensuring strong enforcement but potentially fostering a compliance-driven culture. Key differences emerged in legal specificity, enforcement mechanisms, and the practicalities of implementation. The analysis highlighted the critical role of ethical considerations, workforce capacity, and organizational readiness for effective open disclosure.<br><br>Conclusion: Both Australian and New Zealand open disclosure frameworks offer valuable insights into balancing systemic governance and consumer rights. A hybrid approach, integrating Australia's focus on systemic learning with New Zealand's robust legal mandate for patient rights and explicit ethical considerations, could enhance healthcare quality and transparency. Future research should empirically evaluate the practical implementation and outcomes of such hybrid models."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u548c\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u62ab\u9732\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4f18\u52a3\u52bf\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u548c\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u62ab\u9732\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u70b9\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u56fd\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5236\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u5173\u6000\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u79d1\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ba1\u67e5\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8de8\u56fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "findings": "\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u6846\u67b6\u5f3a\u8c03\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cbb\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u6846\u67b6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5f3a\u5236\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u5411\u5408\u89c4\u6587\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5f3a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u8fdb\u516c\u5f00\u62ab\u9732\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

First, Bitcoin is much more volatile and has a higher variance risk premium than the S&amp;P 500. By decomposing the return premium into different regions of the return state space, we find that while most of the S&amp;P 500 equity premium comes from mildly negative returns, the corresponding negative Bitcoin returns (between three and one standard deviations) account for only one-third of the total Bitcoin premium (BP). Further, applying a novel clustering algorithm to a collection of estimated Bitcoin option-implied risk-neutral densities, we find that risk premia vary over time as a function of two distinct market volatility regimes. The low-volatility regime implies a relatively high share of BP attributable to positive returns and a high Bitcoin Variance Risk Premium (BVRP). In high-volatility states, the BP attributable to positive and negative returns is more balanced, and the BVRP is lower.

Results suggest unique pre/post-inflection relationships, sectoral optimums, and widespread inefficiencies in U.S. public firm innovation capital allocation. This study serves to expand understanding of R&amp;D dynamics, help investors evaluate innovation strategies/mispricing, highlight market inefficiencies for policymakers, and aid corporate allocators in maximizing R&amp;D return.

The article begins by outlining the challenges posed by regional tax measures that may confer selective advantages. The article then analyses how the three criteria of the sufficient autonomy test were applied in the Azores, UGT-Rioja and Gibraltar cases. The article concludes that while the sufficient autonomy test provides a structured approach to assessing geographical tax selectivity, it does not completely eliminate legal uncertainty. Ambiguities remain, especially in interpreting the autonomy criteria and their application in diverse constitutional contexts.

China's Personal Information Protection Law ('PIPL'), which was introduced in 2021, explicitly requires employers to protect the privacy of employees in the course of their work, but as gig workers are not classified as employees under Chinese labor laws, it aggravates the conflict between the management rights of platform companies and workers' privacy. Drawing on the EU's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), this paper proposes the need to clarify the concept of 'necessity' in data collection, expands the scope of applicable subjects in PIPL, and ensures that consent based on true intent is obtained from gig workers. At the same time, it is recommended that communication be strengthened through trade unions to balance the interests between platform companies and gig workers, so as to achieve a dynamic balance and promote the sustainable development of the platform/gig economy."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u96f6\u5de5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u5e73\u53f0\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ba1\u7406\u6743\u4e0e\u96f6\u5de5\u5de5\u4eba\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u300a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u300b\uff08PIPL\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u9274\u6b27\u76df\u300a\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6761\u4f8b\u300b\uff08GDPR\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u5e73\u53f0\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ba1\u7406\u6743\u4e0e\u96f6\u5de5\u5de5\u4eba\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff1f", "motivation": "\u96f6\u5de5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800cPIPL\u56e0\u96f6\u5de5\u5de5\u4eba\u672a\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8ePIPL\u548cGDPR\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u201c\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cd5\uff0c\u501f\u9274GDPR\u63d0\u51faPIPL\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "findings": "\u9700\u660e\u786e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u201c\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u6269\u5927PIPL\u9002\u7528\u4e3b\u4f53\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u96f6\u5de5\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u610f\u613f\u540c\u610f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u96f6\u5de5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4f1a\u6c9f\u901a\u5e73\u8861\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e73\u53f0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This study investigates how the sustainable and urban characteristics of office spaces moderate office leasing decisions in the new RHW era, along with their downstream effects. Using a proprietary dataset covering the Canadian office market after 2020one of the world's most stabilized RHW environments-we combine leasing, sustainability, and mobility data to explore how organizational and employee preferences shape space utilization and environmental outcomes. Findings show that sustainability certifications-both at the asset and landlord level-have cemented their role in the modern definition of high-quality office buildings, and that the strongest demand for office space is situated in vibrant urban areas. Despite the reduced commuting associated with RHW, mobility patterns reveal that workers are commuting longer distances to reach sustainable and urban offices, suggesting that these attributes are highly valued. Taken together, investment into creating sustainable and urban office environments leads to not only strong leasing activity in the building, but also enhanced vibrancy for the surrounding community. Yet there may be unintended consequences associated with the resulting increase in commuting distances, raising concerns about emissions, congestion, and quality of life."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u529e\u516c\uff08RHW\uff09\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\uff0c\u529e\u516c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u79df\u8d41\u51b3\u7b56\u53ca\u5176\u4e0b\u6e38\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728RHW\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u529e\u516c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u79df\u8d41\u51b3\u7b56\u53ca\u5176\u4e0b\u6e38\u6548\u5e94\uff1f", "motivation": "RHW\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u529e\u516c\u79df\u8d41\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u529e\u516c\u7a7a\u95f4\u672a\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u529e\u516c\u7a7a\u95f4\u79df\u8d41\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282020\u5e74\u540e\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u529e\u516c\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79df\u8d41\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u6d3b\u529b\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u529e\u516c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9700\u6c42\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5458\u5de5\u613f\u610f\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u901a\u52e4\u66f4\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u529e\u516c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6295\u8d44\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u529e\u516c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u901a\u52e4\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To design effective policy responses, policymakers must understand the origins, transmission mechanisms, and macroeconomic variables most affected by these shocks. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical and empirical studies examining the impact of these shocks on the domestic macroeconomy. The review identifies a diverse set of theoretical perspectives that together explain how different shocks affect the macroeconomy. Empirically, the literature shows that the magnitude and direction of the impact vary depending on the origin of the shock, the structural characteristics of the economy, the policy regimes, and the degree of external dependency. The review reveals important gaps in the literature, particularly concerning sub-Saharan African economies, stressing the need for further context-specific empirical research."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u56fd\u5185\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "research_question": "\u5916\u90e8\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u56fd\u5185\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5916\u90e8\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3001\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\u3002", "findings": "\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u8d77\u6e90\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u4f53\u5236\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

It argues that in the era of the regulatory welfare state, where the state provides fewer services directly and instead focuses on funding and regulating non-state providers, there is a need to rethink the foundations of social citizenship. The chapter identifies three core dimensions of social citizenship that are challenged by this shift: the status of social rights, the modes of access to rights, and the patterns of accountability between the state, providers, and service users. It shows how the regulatory configuration of welfare governance redefines these dimensions and creates both new opportunities and risks for citizenship. By conceptualizing regulation not merely as a technical tool but as a political and normative field, the chapter offers a lens through which to analyze the evolving relationship between the individual and the state in contemporary welfare regimes. <br></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u5411\u76d1\u7ba1\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u8f6c\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u6c11\u6743\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u76d1\u7ba1\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u6240\u5021\u5bfc\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u6c11\u6743\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ece\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u793e\u4f1a\u670d\u52a1\u8f6c\u5411\u4ee5\u5e02\u573a\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6c\u578b\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u6c11\u6743\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u6c11\u6743\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7ba1\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "findings": "\u76d1\u7ba1\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u6c11\u6743\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\u3001\u6743\u5229\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u9047\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u76d1\u7ba1\u89c6\u4e3a\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u4ee3\u798f\u5229\u4f53\u5236\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Here we link proprietary home-insurance claims from British Columbia, Canada, with administrative property records and high-resolution temperature and precipitation data to quantify the effects of weather on insurance losses. We show that a onestandard-deviation rise in monthly precipitation (+130 mm) increases average claim payouts by 17% and doubles the number of claims (+130%). A comparable one standard deviation increase in average temperatures (+5C) raises claim frequency by roughly 50%, though its effect on claim severity is imprecise. Rolling-window estimates and allowing for linear time trends in weather effects reveal little evidence of adaptation over our sample from 2001-2021.

The system integrates a multi-stage fuzzy logic controller (MS-FLC) with a fuzzy-defined risk evaluation mechanism to address real-time decision-making under data uncertainty. A linguistic Risk Factor is formulated based on incident severity, time-of-day, and control effectiveness, enabling adaptive control decisions through fuzzy inference. Simulation experiments using a representative network and diverse incident scenarios demonstrate that UA-DSS significantly outperforms conventional strategies such as ALINEA and non-risk-adaptive MS-FLC. The proposed approach shows strong robustness, improving mainline traffic flow and minimizing ramp queue spillback, even under delayed or imprecise input conditions. This work contributes to the field of intelligent transportation systems by providing a practical and interpretable AI-driven traffic control architecture, aligned with EAAI\u2019s emphasis on engineering applications of fuzzy logic and real-time decision support"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08UA-DSS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u531d\u9053\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08MS-FLC\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u7cca\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\u5236\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUA-DSS\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982ALINEA\u548c\u975e\u98ce\u9669\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684MS-FLC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4e3b\u7ebf\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u531d\u9053\u6392\u961f\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u57ce\u5e02\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u531d\u9053\u63a7\u5236\uff1f", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u531d\u9053\u63a7\u5236\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08MS-FLC\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "findings": "UA-DSS\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6392\u961f\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u7684\u531d\u9053\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We provide mathematical reasoning to explain the different mechanisms of full-sample matching and bootstrap subsampling matching that lead to changes in performance. We define the utilization rate and investigate the conditions where bootstrap subsampling enhances the estimate of the average treatment effect on the treated group (ATT). In addition, we propose a comparable weighted subsampling method and evaluate these methodologies against a baseline method regarding their ATT estimates. We conduct extensive simulations under two different data generation frameworks (threshold rule with linear regression and probability assignment with logistic regression models).

Our model estimates the e ects of initiating alcohol and marijuana use on educational attainment, allowing these e ects to vary by age of initiation. Average marginal e ects suggest that marijuana use reduces the probability of progressing to the next grade by 10.2 percentage points when initiated before age 16, and by 4 percentage points when initiated after age 15. For alcohol, the corresponding e ects are -4.5 and -5.8 percentage points, respectively.

Most research uses the standard measures of money, however there are potential gains from adopting the Divisia approach for estimating the welfare costs of inflation, as this should better capture the flow of monetary services when standard monetary aggregates include interest bearing close substitutes for money. However, there is a problem if the Divisia aggregate does not track all forms of near money.

This also holds when deriving the heteroskedastic three-factor ICAPM of Campbell, Giglio, Polk, and Turley (2018).

While large corporations have rapidly adopted AI, SMEs\u2014particularly in Italy\u2014face structural, cultural, and demographic obstacles that hinder technological transition. The study explores how AI affects internal strategic processes in SMEs, emphasizing the human and organizational implications beyond mere technical implementation. Through a quantitative survey conducted among employees of three SMEs in the Umbria region, the research highlights a duality in perceptions: openness to AI\u2019s benefits coexists with emotional resistance, especially among older workers. Key barriers identified include lack of digital skills, resistance to change, and limited organizational readiness. However, the study also uncovers effective change management practices, such as reverse mentoring, inclusive leadership, and phased adoption strategies. The concept of \u201cInvisible AI\u201d\u2014AI embedded in everyday tools without users\u2019 awareness\u2014emerges as a critical issue, suggesting the need for more targeted training and transparent communication.

This research study investigates the structure of data culture as well as its direct impact on business performance in Saudi Arabia. Data has become a crucial asset in today's global ecosystem, with both public and private sectors relying on it for quality, timeliness, and velocity. However, many organizations struggle to adopt an enterprise culture of data, especially in developing countries like the Middle East and Africa. This research investigates data-driven culture and maturity in selected data management domains in Saudi Arabia, and it analyses the impact of data-driven culture on business performance. The study adopted a quantitative research technique, using online surveys, interviews, and secondary data sources. The research used an online survey designed to elicit the research questions answers and feedback autonomously, and the survey tool is considered as a primary data source through the research analysis. Furthermore, this research had a group of interviews that gave a significant viewpoint from business sector representatives. The study's results showed a highly positive correlation between data-driven culture and business performance, with the top five sectors ranking highest in datadriven performance. The key analysis found a high positive connection (0.96) between data-driven culture and business performance across fifteen different business sectors in Saudi Arabia. These findings highlight the critical importance of data culture in determining business competitiveness. A higher degree of datadriven maturity, expertise, and established procedures improves business performance and develops an innovative and adaptable culture; this implies that when an organisation in any business sector has a higher level of Data-driven culture maturity, this will positively impact its business performance in the sector particular and Saudi Arabia overall country. The research findings indicate a variant data-driven culture maturity in data management domains, such as data quality and reference data management. Sectors should assess these domains and plan data roadmaps using best practices like DAMA and TOGAF. Personal data protection and privacy are global challenges but have lower maturity scores. Activities should be conducted to improve awareness, orientation, and training in these areas, led by local regulators like NDMO in Saudi Arabia. Business sectors should prioritize establishing a data-driven culture, investing in infrastructure, improving data literacy, establishing KPIs, encouraging teamwork, and continuously evaluating and adapting data-driven initiatives."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb\uff080.96\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5168\u7403\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u4e1c\u548c\u975e\u6d32\u5730\u533a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DAMA\u548cTOGAF\u7b49\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u4e8c\u624b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\u5448\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff080.96\uff09\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u4e1c\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u6295\u8d44\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u7d20\u517b\u7b49\u3002"}}

However, there is still room for improvement. This research aims to study the importance of good governance for FDI inflows, along with other classical factors (market size, development level, trade openness, and human capital), in the ASEAN region from 2000 to 2022. Using the fixed effects panel data technique, the results show that the control of corruption exerts a positive and significant influence on FDI in ASEAN. Meanwhile, voice and accountability, though significant, still swayed FDI in the opposite direction, while political stability is found to be insignificant for FDI in ASEAN. Market size, development level, and human capital proved equally important in positively influencing FDI. Trade openness is significant but negatively associated with FDI. The key finding is that improving good governance factors like the control of corruption can play an imperative role in further enhancing the FDI attractiveness of ASEAN."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e1c\u76df\u5730\u533a2000-2022\u5e74\u95f4\u826f\u597d\u6cbb\u7406\uff08\u5982\u8150\u8d25\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u8d38\u6613\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u548c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\uff09\u5bf9FDI\u6d41\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8150\u8d25\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9FDI\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u58f0\u97f3\u4e0e\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u867d\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u5411\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5219\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u5bf9FDI\u6709\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8d38\u6613\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u5219\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "research_question": "\u826f\u597d\u6cbb\u7406\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e1c\u76df\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5916\u56fd\u76f4\u63a5\u6295\u8d44\uff08FDI\uff09\u6d41\u5165\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e1c\u76df\u5730\u533a\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u6210\u4e3a\u70ed\u95e8FDI\u76ee\u7684\u5730\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u53d1\u6325\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584\u6cbb\u7406\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfFDI\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982\u8150\u8d25\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u58f0\u97f3\u4e0e\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u6280\u672f\u5206\u67902000-2022\u5e74\u4e1c\u76df\u5730\u533a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u8150\u8d25\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9FDI\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u58f0\u97f3\u4e0e\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u5411\u76f8\u53cd\uff1b\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cdFDI\uff1b\u8d38\u6613\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u6cbb\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9FDI\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e1c\u76df\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e1c\u76df\u56fd\u5bb6\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u6cbb\u7406\uff08\u5982\u8150\u8d25\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u4ee5\u5438\u5f15\u66f4\u591aFDI\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

To address these issues, an adaptive MPPT control strategy based on a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is proposed in this work. Leveraging the advantage of the GRU in time series prediction, the method predicts the optimal reference voltage by learning wind speed variation trends, thereby accelerating the convergence of the MPPT algorithm. Furthermore, the predicted results are integrated with an improved three-point search method to increase algorithm robustness. Both the simulation and experimental results under varying wind conditions demonstrate that, compared with conventional control strategies, the proposed GRU-enhanced P&O method significantly increases the system response speed and steady-state accuracy. This method effectively enhances power generation efficiency, reduces voltage and power fluctuations, and enables the wind energy system to achieve maximum power output while maintaining stable operation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08GRU\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684MPPT\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u7535\u538b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfP&O MPPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u98ce\u901f\u5267\u70c8\u6ce2\u52a8\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u6162\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u98ce\u901f\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edfMPPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u98ce\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08GRU\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408GRU\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e09\u70b9\u641c\u7d22\u6cd5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94MPPT\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "findings": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7535\u538b\u548c\u529f\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGRU\u7684MPPT\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u98ce\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

For teen girls, in particular, social media is more than just a tool for communication it is a mirror through which they often view their bodies, compare themselves to others, and develop their sense of worth. This research explores the intricate and multifaceted relationship between social media use and body image in teenage girls, drawing from a range of psychological studies, social theories, and first-hand accounts to uncover the emotional and behavioral consequences that arise from life in a digital world dominated by filtered realities and aesthetic ideals. Through a combination of literature review and anecdotal evidence, the paper unpacks how platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat have become digital stages where beauty, thinness, and desirability are often rewarded, while deviation from such norms is ignored or even shamed. Teen girls are constantly bombarded with images that portray idealized versions of beauty images that are often edited, filtered, and unrealistic. These visuals do not exist in a vacuum; they create standards against which young girls measure their own bodies, leading to feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, and even self-loathing. In many cases, this comparison is not limited to celebrities and influencers, but extends to classmates and peers making it even more personal, immediate, and painful."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5bf9\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u5b69\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u5f62\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u7f8e\u6807\u51c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u5351\u548c\u7126\u8651\u3002", "research_question": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u5b69\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u5f62\u8c61\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5bf9\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u5b69\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u8eab\u4f53\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7f8e\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u5b69\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u4e2a\u6848\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u5982Instagram\u3001TikTok\u3001Snapchat\uff09\u5bf9\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u5b69\u8eab\u4f53\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7f8e\u6807\u51c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u5b69\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u5351\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u6000\u7591\u751a\u81f3\u81ea\u6211\u538c\u6076\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u5b69\u8eab\u4f53\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5bb6\u957f\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e72\u9884\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of cow genotype (purebred vs. crossbred) and herbage allowance (high vs. low) on reproductive success across three biologically relevant periods: I) service to pregnancy diagnosis, II) pregnancy diagnosis to calving, and III) calving to weaning. A total of 1,069 reproductive events from 1,069 Hereford, Angus, and reciprocal crossbred cows were analyzed from 2007 to 2022 under native pasture conditions in Uruguay. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate posterior probabilities of reproductive success, accounting for repeated measures and individual cow effects. Results showed that crossbred cows consistently had higher probabilities of success across all reproductive periods. Under low herbage allowance, the advantage of crossbred cows was most pronounced in Periods I and III (\u0394 > 0.20; P (\u0394 > 0) > 0.99), indicating a genotype \u00d7 nutrition interaction.

Efforts to address such issues are further impeded by systemic racism and a lack of culturally appropriate services. According to Black youth, the most prevalent issue was perceived racial bias, with the preferred solution being diverse staff recruitment. Service providers highlighted the most prevalent issue to be cultural and linguistic barriers in the system, with the preferred solution being increased outreach from community partners and other ethno-specific organizations to improve culturally appropriate services.ConclusionIdentifying issues of similarity and differences as well as potential policy solutions provides a holistic and comprehensive analysis that can inform policy makers of strategies that will benefit both Black youth and service providers.

However, the impact mechanism of their financing mode selection on emission reduction efficiency and economic benefits has not been fully revealed, and there is a lack of support from a systematic theoretical framework. Therefore, this study innovatively constructs a multi-agent Stackelberg game model with bank financing, green bond financing, and internal factoring financing. We incorporate the embedding degree, emission reduction cost coefficient and financing mode selection into a unified analysis framework. The research findings are as follows: (1) There is a significant positive linear relationship between supply chain profit and the embedding degree. In contrast, the profit of ESCOs shows an inverted \"U\" - shaped change trend. Moreover, there is a sustainable cooperation threshold for each of the three financing modes. (2) Green bond financing can significantly increase the overall emission reduction rate of the supply chain in high-embedding-degree scenarios. However, due to short-term cost pressure, ESCOs tend to choose bank financing. (3) The dynamic change of the emission reduction investment cost coefficient will trigger a reversal effect on the financing preferences of the supply chain and ESCOs. This study unveils the internal mechanism of multi-party decision-making interaction in the low-carbon supply chain. It offers a scientific basis and practical guidance for optimizing ESCO financing strategies, crafting incentive contracts, and enhancing government subsidy policies."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86ESCOs\u5728\u78b3\u914d\u989d\u4ea4\u6613\u653f\u7b56\u548cEPC\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u878d\u8d44\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u51b3\u7b56\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u7406\u3002", "research_question": "ESCOs\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u63ed\u793aESCOs\u878d\u8d44\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u94f6\u884c\u878d\u8d44\u3001\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u878d\u8d44\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u4fdd\u7406\u878d\u8d44\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u3001\u51cf\u6392\u6210\u672c\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u878d\u8d44\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7eb3\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "findings": "1. \u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5229\u6da6\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u5448\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0cESCOs\u5229\u6da6\u5448\u5012\u201cU\u201d\u5f62\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b2. \u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u878d\u8d44\u5728\u9ad8\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u51cf\u6392\u7387\uff0c\u4f46ESCOs\u56e0\u77ed\u671f\u6210\u672c\u538b\u529b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u94f6\u884c\u878d\u8d44\uff1b3. \u51cf\u6392\u6295\u8d44\u6210\u672c\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u9006\u8f6c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u548cESCOs\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u504f\u597d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u78b3\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u591a\u65b9\u51b3\u7b56\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u7406\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316ESCOs\u878d\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6fc0\u52b1\u5408\u540c\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u653f\u5e9c\u8865\u8d34\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Second-life Batteries (SLBs), which no longer meet the performance and range requirements for vehicular use but are still viable for stationary applications, especially combined with photovoltaic generation, represent a significant opportunity in this promising market. This paper proposes a novel pricing model for SLBs, using option pricing concepts to assess and incorporate the associated risks, thereby facilitating the establishment of a viable SLB market. The pricing methodology hinges on risk assessment, discounting this from the cost of a kWh from a new Li-ion battery based on SLB characteristics: the price of a new Li-ion battery, its usage time, and the market risk-free rate (nominal interest rate). A case study is carried out on real batteries from Nissan Leaf\u00ae vehicles that have been used as taxis in Brazil for five years, applying the proposed methodology to illustrate its practicality and effectiveness. To enable efficient and dynamic price estimation, a web-based application, the SLB Price Calculator, was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tool implements the proposed methodology, allowing users to calculate either a price range or a single value. Furthermore, the paper discusses the limitations of the current methodology and explores the potential for integrating blockchain technology to enhance transparency and trust in the remaining battery life valuation process. The conclusion underscores the utility of the proposed pricing tool in fostering the growth of the energy storage market, paving the way for the further development of SLB business models."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7eb3\u5165\u4e8c\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\uff08SLBs\uff09\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u884c\u7684SLB\u5e02\u573a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u5de5\u5177\uff08SLB\u4ef7\u683c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\uff08SLBs\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5e02\u573a\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e8c\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\uff08SLBs\uff09\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548cSLB\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5df4\u897f\u65e5\u4ea7Leaf\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u7535\u6c60\uff09\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u5de5\u5177\uff08SLB\u4ef7\u683c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30SLB\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u683c\u4f30\u7b97\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSLB\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SLB\u4ef7\u683c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The paper uses panel data from Tanzania to examine whether and to what extent droughts affect household demand for credit from banks, microfinance, and informal lenders. The paper also estimates the effects of droughts on household demand for credit used for\u00a0business activities, non-food consumption, and subsistence. Our results show two household borrowing patterns during periods of drought. Results show that droughts do not affect credit from banks and microfinance institutions/groups but significantly increase demand for credit from informal lenders. We also found that while droughts do not affect business and consumer credits, they increase subsistence credit.

Didessa watershed in southwestern Ethiopia characterized by rugged topography dominated with subsistence rainfed agriculture illustrates this vulnerability. This study aims to quantify the spatiotemporal soil loss (SL) and sediment export (SE) (1987-2023) using RUSLE\u2013InVEST model, identify erosion hotspot sub-watersheds, and estimate reclamation cost to inform sustainable watershed management. Multi temporal satellite imagery (1987, 2000, 2013, and 2023), rainfall and soil data were used to estimate SL and SE (t/ha/yr). The study revealed, 67% of the watershed was occupied with agricultural land.There was a substantial increase in mean annual SL 163% (8.89 in 1987 to 23.44 t/ha/yr in 2023) and SE 367% (2.1 to 9.8 t/ha/yr), illustrating deterioration of the watershed. ANOVA results showed a statistically significant difference in both SL (F 227, p< 0.0001) and SE (F 213.62, p< 0.0001) across the study period, showing a steady rise. The rates of erosion concisely varied among the 26 sub-watershed, with the four (SW-1, SW-17, SW-20 and SW-26) having sever erosion levels (50 -63t/ha), two (SW-19 and SW-6) the lowest (<20 t/ha) and the rest sub-watersheds having moderate rates. Rainfall, sub-watershed size, slope gradient and elevation were significantly determining (p <0.05) the erosion rate across years and land uses. The estimated cost to reclamation these degraded soils and restore the ecosystem services was about USD 24 million.\u00a0 Thus, urgent conservation actions are essential to mitigate the escalating environmental degradation and \u00a0associated economic impacts."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528RUSLE\u2013InVEST\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9aDidessa\u6d41\u57df1987-2023\u5e74\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u6d41\u5931\u548c\u6c89\u79ef\u7269\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d41\u57df\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u6210\u672c\u4f30\u7b97\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u91cf\u5316Didessa\u6d41\u57df\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u6d41\u5931\u548c\u6c89\u79ef\u7269\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4fb5\u8680\u70ed\u70b9\u533a\u57df\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u73af\u5883\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0cDidessa\u6d41\u57df\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u571f\u58e4\u4fb5\u8680\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u79d1\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eRUSLE\u2013InVEST\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u964d\u96e8\u548c\u571f\u58e4\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528RUSLE\u2013InVEST\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u67901987-2023\u5e74\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ANOVA\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u6d41\u57df\u518567%\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u7528\u5730\uff0c\u571f\u58e4\u6d41\u5931\u548c\u6c89\u79ef\u7269\u8f93\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4fb5\u8680\u70ed\u70b9\u533a\u57df\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5b50\u6d41\u57df\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u571f\u58e4\u4fb5\u8680\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6d41\u57df\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6001\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u6062\u590d\u6210\u672c\u4e3a2400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002"}}

We posit the presence of a high level of collusion in the Tanzanian tobacco industry that manipulates market prices and subjecting farmers to a state that diminishes their bargaining power, reducing their benefits, leading to persistent poverty. To validate these claims, we conducted this research to investigate the state of Tanzania&apos;s tobacco industry for cartel practices, using statistical and machine learning (ML) models. We identified patterns of similarity using correlation approaches and used ML models to learn complex patterns of cartels using data collected over the past 30 years. Our results demonstrated that five companies running this industry in Tanzania exhibit similar patterns suggestive of collusion. They set similar and highly correlated prices over the years, and exhibited similar trends in the amount of tobacco they purchased. Surprisingly, despite having their own factories for processing tobacco, these companies appeared to process their tobacco at one unit, suggesting the presence of hidden collusive agreements forcing these companies to have one center for processing. Our results further demonstrate that ML models can effectively learn complex patterns of tobacco collusion, with performance (SVM) of 93% accuracy, 92AUC, 100% sensitivity, and 83% specificity.

These interactions are characterized by high conflict density, rapidly changing priorities, and limited visibility, requiring drivers to make fast, strategic decisions under uncertainty. However, many existing studies focus on either single-stage conflicts or trajectory-level predictions, which may limit their ability to reveal the underlying cognitive processes and strategic adaptations in multi-road user, multi-phase interactions. Addressing this gap, this study proposes a game-theoretic framework for modeling interaction strategies in complex intersection scenarios, especially those involving multi-phase and multi-type conflicts. The framework integrates key behavioral constructs, including safety-efficiency trade-offs, bounded rationality, and sequential decision dependencies across interaction rounds. Two formulations\u2014simultaneous and sequential games\u2014are developed to represent different reasoning levels and information structures. Real-world interaction data are extracted from the DAIR-V2X trajectory dataset, and model parameters are calibrated using observed behavioral patterns. Results show that the sequential game model better captures the adaptive evolution of strategies across interaction phases. Left-turning vehicles exhibit a gradual shift from yielding to assertiveness, with reduced risk sensitivity toward motor vehicles and non-motorized participants, but heightened caution toward pedestrians. This study provides a scalable and interpretable approach to modeling multi-agent behavior at intersections, contributing to both theory and practice.

In contrast to traditional Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models and those based solely on Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), the Jump-Diffusion approach offers a more realistic response to market uncertainties by incorporating sudden, significant fluctuations in key variables. Specifically, the current price of oil and the USD/NOK exchange rate are modeled as stochastic processes governed by the Merton Jump-Diffusion framework. A corresponding partial differential equation is derived and solved numerically using the finite difference method under multiple uncertainty scenarios. Project valuations for each scenario are computed in MATLAB. In this model, jumps are triggered when the absolute return of an asset exceeds the sum of its mean and twice its standard deviation. The average jump size and associated risk are incorporated into the valuation process. Additionally, to enhance the forward-looking component of the analysis, Brent crude oil prices and the USD/NOK exchange rate are forecast using a Transformer-based deep learning model implemented in Python."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b9e\u7269\u671f\u6743\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528Merton\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u632a\u5a01Oseberg\u6cb9\u7530\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6cb9\u4ef7\u548c\u6c47\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b9e\u7269\u671f\u6743\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5229\u7528Merton\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u77f3\u6cb9\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDCF\u548cGBM\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Merton\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u5b9e\u7269\u671f\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u3001Transformer\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u6cb9\u4ef7\u548c\u6c47\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aMerton\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2. \u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528MATLAB\u8ba1\u7b97\u9879\u76ee\u4f30\u503c\uff1b4. \u5229\u7528Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6cb9\u4ef7\u548c\u6c47\u7387\u3002", "findings": "\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5b9e\u7269\u671f\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u77f3\u6cb9\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u77f3\u6cb9\u9879\u76ee\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We support this conjecture with evidence suggesting that institutional imbalances exhibit strong autocorrelation, whereas retail imbalances do not. We also show that the predictive capacity of all imbalance types disappears on the days of macroeconomic announcements. More interestingly, on these days, the imbalances\u2019 autocorrelation ceases, suggesting that institutional investors rapidly incorporate the newly available information into prices."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5df4\u897f\u80a1\u5e02\u4e2d\u96f6\u552e\u4e70\u5356\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6bd4\u673a\u6784\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u66f4\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u8ba2\u5355\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\u9010\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4ea4\u6613\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u516c\u544a\u65e5\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65e5\u8fc5\u901f\u5c06\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u7eb3\u5165\u4ef7\u683c\u3002", "research_question": "\u96f6\u552e\u4e70\u5356\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u673a\u6784\u4e70\u5356\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6295\u8d44\u8005\uff08\u96f6\u552e\u548c\u673a\u6784\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8ba2\u5355\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u5047\u8bf4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5df4\u897f\u80a1\u5e02\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u96f6\u552e\u548c\u673a\u6784\u4e70\u5356\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "findings": "\u96f6\u552e\u4e70\u5356\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6bd4\u673a\u6784\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u66f4\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\uff1b\u673a\u6784\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u96f6\u552e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6ca1\u6709\uff1b\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u516c\u544a\u65e5\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u8ba2\u5355\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u76d1\u7ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u4ea4\u6613\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This paper presents a comprehensive case study analysis of the Dominican Republic's inaugural sovereign green bond, a USD 750 million issuance in June 2024, examining its structure and performance as a potential model for sustainable finance (Global Green Growth Institute, 2025; World Bank, 2025). The analysis finds that the issuance was highly successful, achieving a notable 15-basis-point pricing advantage, or \"greenium,\" attributable to a robust pre-issuance governance framework and strong international investor confidence (World Bank, 2025). However, this initial success is offset by two challenges: a national climate finance gap exceeding USD 17.6 billion required to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, and the pervasive global risk of \"greenwashing,\" which threatens to erode investor trust and erase pricing advantages (Dominican Republic, 2020; Hong Kong Monetary Authority, 2022). This paper argues that to transition from a successful single transaction to a scalable national strategy, EMEs must institutionalize credibility through radical, technologyenabled transparency. It proposes the development of a \"Green Bond Impact Tracker,\" a national digital platform for transparent monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of bond proceeds and their environmental impacts. This proposed solution is presented as a strategic instrument designed to institutionalize transparency, proactively mitigate greenwashing risk, and thereby secure and expand the nation's access to preferential climate financing while simultaneously fulfilling international climate reporting obligations under the Paris Agreement's Enhanced Transparency Framework (UNFCCC, n.d.-b)."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u591a\u7c73\u5c3c\u52a0\u5171\u548c\u56fd2024\u5e74\u53d1\u884c\u7684\u9996\u53ea\u4e3b\u6743\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\uff087.5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u52a8\u5458\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d44\u672c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u503a\u5238\u6210\u529f\u83b7\u5f9715\u4e2a\u57fa\u70b9\u7684\u201c\u7eff\u8272\u6ea2\u4ef7\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u56fd\u5bb6\u6c14\u5019\u878d\u8d44\u7f3a\u53e3\u548c\u201c\u6f02\u7eff\u201d\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "research_question": "\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6743\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6548\u52a8\u5458\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d44\u672c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d44\u672c\u52a8\u5458\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u591a\u7c73\u5c3c\u52a0\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u6848\u4f8b\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u91d1\u878d\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4e3b\u6743\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u7c73\u5c3c\u52a0\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4e3b\u6743\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "findings": "\u503a\u5238\u53d1\u884c\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u83b7\u5f9715\u4e2a\u57fa\u70b9\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u6ea2\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e3417.6\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u878d\u8d44\u7f3a\u53e3\u548c\u6f02\u7eff\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u201c\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u5f71\u54cd\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u201d\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u56fd\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6f02\u7eff\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u6c14\u5019\u878d\u8d44\u6e20\u9053\u3002"}}

The model\u2019s habit persistence structure further captures established recharging routines that influence both when and where charging occurs. The proposed model is applied to data capturing weekly charging activities collected using an online survey disseminated to a sample of EV owners recruited from across Australia between February and March 2024. Results show that charging at home is the most prevalent behaviour, with a strong tendency towards daytime charging largely driven by households with access to residential solar panels. Workplace charging emerges as a viable alternative to home charging when employers provide free charging and commuting frequency is high. The model also reveals the presence of state dependencies in charging behaviour, indicating that past choices are likely to influence current charging patterns.

The tunnel, a part of the New Rail Link through the Alps, serves as a key instrument of the so-called \"modal shift policy,\" which aims to transfer transalpine freight traffic from road to rail. The reduction in travel time by train between northern and southern Switzerland raised expectations that a substantial share of tourist-oriented passenger traffic would also shift from car to rail. In this paper, we conduct a causal analysis of the impact of the Gotthard Base Tunnel&apos;s opening at the end of 2016 on the number of cars using the parallel Gotthard motorway section in the subsequent years. To this end, we apply the synthetic control and synthetic difference-in-differences methods to construct a synthetic Gotthard motorway section based on a weighted combination of other alpine road crossings (a so-called donor pool) that did not experience the construction of a competing rail infrastructure. Our results reveal only a modest but statistically significant decline in the number of cars between the actual and the synthetic Gotthard motorway in the short run. Given the consistently strong and increasing demand for the new rail connection through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, we infer a substantial induced short-run demand effect resulting from the rail travel time savings."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e862016\u5e74\u5e95\u5f00\u901a\u7684\u54e5\u8fbe\u57fa\u7ebf\u96a7\u9053\u5bf9\u5e73\u884c\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u6c7d\u8f66\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96a7\u9053\u5f00\u901a\u540e\u6c7d\u8f66\u6d41\u91cf\u4ec5\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u94c1\u8def\u9700\u6c42\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "research_question": "\u54e5\u8fbe\u57fa\u7ebf\u96a7\u9053\u7684\u5f00\u901a\u5bf9\u5e73\u884c\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u6c7d\u8f66\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u96a7\u9053\u5f00\u901a\u662f\u5426\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u516c\u8def\u5230\u94c1\u8def\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u6cd5\u548c\u5408\u6210\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u865a\u62df\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3002", "findings": "\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u6c7d\u8f66\u6d41\u91cf\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u94c1\u8def\u9700\u6c42\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5bf9\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Unlike economic rights, which protect the author\u2019s ability to generate returns, non-economic rights protect the author\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with her work\u2014a relationship that arises from investing one\u2019s personality into the work by creating it. In its strongest \u201cmonastic\u201d form, moral rights give the author the absolute power to prevent any use that offends her sensibilities. While the monastic view of moral rights exists in only a few countries, the sentiment underlying it is pervasive in moral rights theory: an author\u2019s claims are superior to all others because only the author knows when harm occurs, regardless of others\u2019 views. In other words, certain uses of works result in the author experiencing harm that no one else can experience and that does not depend on what others think. This Article asks and evaluates the following question: can this type of internal harm\u2014based only on the author\u2019s subjective experience\u2014justify a monastic version of moral rights?</span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>It argues that the answer is probably not\u2014and that, if supported, monastic moral rights will be tightly limited. Drawing on literature in science fiction and philosophy, this Article contends that the best justification for the monastic view is also the most implausible: authors have moral rights only when another\u2019s use causes the author to experience an inconsistency between her perceived use of the work and her memories of creating the work. In short, an author\u2019s rights are contingent on her ability to remember creating her work. This is the best justification because the author\u2019s memories of creating the work satisfy all the requirements for authorial harm: it identifies discrete psychological states that are tied directly and only to the author\u2019s acts of creation, independent of others\u2019 perceptions. It is the least plausible, however, because it conditions important rights on one\u2019s ability to remember past actions. Despite its seeming implausibility, the author\u2019s memories of creation provide the best support for grounding monastic moral rights.

Despite the overall negative effect on AGOA products, the impact is more pronounced for apparel products and AGOA products that do not have overlapping Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) eligibility.\u00a0In response to the suspension, countries tend to cope with the shock by diverting their trade routes to China, with the effect being more evident for countries with strong bilateral relationships with China."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u64a4\u9500\u8d38\u6613\u4f18\u60e0\u5f85\u9047\u5bf9\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u975e\u6d32\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u673a\u4f1a\u6cd5\u6848\uff08AGOA\uff09\u6682\u505c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\uff08SSA\uff09\u56fd\u5bb6\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5411\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u8d38\u6613\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "research_question": "\u64a4\u9500\u8d38\u6613\u4f18\u60e0\u5f85\u9047\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u8868\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u8d38\u6613\u653f\u7b56\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fAGOA\u6682\u505c\u5bf9SSA\u56fd\u5bb6\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u53ca\u5176\u8d38\u6613\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d38\u6613\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u51b2\u51fb\u548c\u8d38\u6613\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff08triple difference-in-differences\uff09\u5206\u67902001-2023\u5e74\u95f4\u7684659,180\u4e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "AGOA\u6682\u505c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11SSA\u56fd\u5bb6\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u670d\u88c5\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u672a\u91cd\u53e0GSP\u8d44\u683c\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fd\u5bb6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u8d38\u6613\u8f6c\u5411\u4e2d\u56fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e0e\u4e2d\u56fd\u6709\u5f3a\u53cc\u8fb9\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u8d38\u6613\u653f\u7b56\u51b2\u51fb\u4e0e\u8d38\u6613\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8d38\u6613\u4f18\u60e0\u64a4\u9500\u540e\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Building on our earlier analysis of under-five multidimensional poverty in India (Bonnerjee, 2025), this paper generalizes the application of machine learning methods to the national MPI framework to reveal deeper structural weaknesses. This research highlights critical flaws in the orthodox application of the Alkire-Foster methodology in India\u2014particularly the arbitrary k = 1/3 cutoff threshold and predetermined indicator weights\u2014through comprehensive sensitivity analysis and machine learning alternatives. Using data from India\u2019s National Family Health Survey (2019\u201321), we show that the conventional threshold lies within a zone of maximum statistical instability, where small shifts lead to dramatic changes in poverty estimates. Our unsupervised machine learning approach, using K-means clustering, identifies optimal separation points between k = 0.22 and 0.24\u2014far below the conventional threshold\u2014yielding MPI estimates that are 69\u2013127% higher than official figures. In other words, the progress that India has been making with respect to multidimensional poverty, though laudable, is being overstated because of the orthodoxy of assumpt. These data-driven classifications bypass the need for arbitrary cutoffs, offering a more empirically grounded basis for identifying deprivation. Multi-tier models based on this approach, challenge the binary classification and reveal a nuanced spectrum of poverty, identifying a substantial \u201cmedium deprivation\u201d population (32\u201338% of households) that remains invisible under binary poor/non-poor categorizations. Furthermore, conventional weighting schemes distort results in ways that undermine both accuracy and policy relevance. These findings point to a measurement crisis \u2013 millions of genuinely deprived households remain excluded from recognition and support due to a methodological orthodoxy that privileges theoretical consistency over empirical validity. The evidence calls for a methodological transition toward objective, data-driven approaches and assumptions that better align with the realities of deprivation and the demands of evidence-based policymaking.</span>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u591a\u7ef4\u8d2b\u56f0\u6307\u6570\uff08MPI\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u9608\u503c\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d2b\u56f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u5ea6\u591a\u7ef4\u8d2b\u56f0\u6307\u6570\uff08MPI\uff09\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u8d2b\u56f0\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1f", "motivation": "MPI\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u626d\u66f2\u8d2b\u56f0\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Alkire-Foster\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001K-means\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u8d2b\u56f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5370\u5ea6\u56fd\u5bb6\u5bb6\u5ead\u5065\u5eb7\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff082019\u201321\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548cK-means\u805a\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "findings": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9608\u503c\uff08k=1/3\uff09\u5904\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff08k=0.22\u20130.24\uff09\u663e\u793a\u8d2b\u56f0\u7387\u6bd4\u5b98\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u9ad869\u2013127%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8d2b\u56f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u8d2b\u56f0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u547c\u5401\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u8d2b\u56f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Our study thus explains why, contrary to conventional wisdom, moral hazard can increase due to capital infusions in government-controlled banks, due to borrower-level political connections."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u94f6\u884c\u653e\u8d37\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d44\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u540e\u94f6\u884c\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5411\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u653e\u8d37\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5267\u50f5\u5c38\u8d37\u6b3e\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "research_question": "\u8d44\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u653f\u5e9c\u63a7\u5236\u94f6\u884c\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u653e\u8d37\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u7aef\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u5f53\u5229\u76ca\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4f9b\u7ed9\u7aef\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u94f6\u884c\u56e0\u6b64\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e0e\u94f6\u884c\u653e\u8d37\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8d44\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u94f6\u884c\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5370\u5ea6\u624b\u5de5\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u7ea7\u522b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8d44\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u540e\u94f6\u884c\u653e\u8d37\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u8d44\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u540e\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5411\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u653e\u8d37\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u8d44\u4e0d\u62b5\u503a\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u50f5\u5c38\u8d37\u6b3e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d44\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u52a0\u5267\u94f6\u884c\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d44\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u52a0\u5f3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002"}}

We find that both growth and inflation forecasts are unbiased at forecast horizons up to one year. At longer horizons growth forecasts are upward biased due to unpredicted recessions. Accuracy and efficiency of GDP growth forecasts strongly depend on the state of the business cycle, suggesting that forecasters allocate more attention to predicting growth during recessions.

Difficulties that the government faced in reaching these individuals and their high costs of adopting digital technologies contribute to the low take-up.

The program also increased financial stability, with a 55%increase in the probability of saving and a 30% improvement in food security perceptions.

Total welfare of employed workers declines by about 0.9 percent and younger workers experience larger losses."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5e74\u8f7b\u5458\u5de5\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u52a0\u5165\u5e74\u8f7b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u6d3b\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u5bf9\u5458\u5de5\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u679c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5747\u8861\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bf9\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7ea645%\u7684\u96c7\u4e3b\u8f6c\u6362\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c15%\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u4eba\u53e3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "research_question": "\u516c\u53f8\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u6d3b\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e74\u8f7b\u5458\u5de5\u548c\u5e74\u8f7b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5747\u8861\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5728\u804c\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5747\u8861\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u516c\u53f8\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u516c\u53f8\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7ea645%\u7684\u96c7\u4e3b\u8f6c\u6362\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c15%\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u4eba\u53e3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5458\u5de5\u603b\u798f\u5229\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea60.9%\uff0c\u5e74\u8f7b\u5458\u5de5\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u5747\u8861\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u53f8\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bf9\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u5e74\u8f7b\u5458\u5de5\u5c31\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

With Medicaid financing some LTC for low-income individuals and private LTC insurance paying less than 3% of total LTC, the rest of these costs are borne by individuals. Nevertheless, there is limited research on how individuals prepare for future caregiving. To better understand how prepared US adults are to become caregivers, we conducted a survey of both caregivers and non-caregiving adults to understand how individuals plan or anticipate providing care for elders. We find that adults who anticipate becoming caregivers understand some elements of what caregiving will require of them, but they also underestimate many of the negative impacts caregiving can have, from financial to healthrelated, and spend little time planning or preparing for caregiving."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u52302030\u5e74\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd20%\u7684\u5c45\u6c11\u5c06\u8d85\u8fc765\u5c81\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d70%\u9884\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u62a4\u7406\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7167\u62a4\uff08LTC\uff09\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684LTC\u90e8\u5206\u7531\u533b\u7597\u8865\u52a9\u652f\u4ed8\uff0c\u800c\u79c1\u4ebaLTC\u4fdd\u9669\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u52303%\u7684\u8d39\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u8d39\u7528\u7531\u4e2a\u4eba\u627f\u62c5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u62a4\u7406\u505a\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u62a4\u7406\u8005\u548c\u975e\u62a4\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7f8e\u56fd\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u5bf9\u6210\u4e3a\u62a4\u7406\u8005\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9884\u671f\u6210\u4e3a\u62a4\u7406\u8005\u7684\u4eba\u867d\u7136\u4e86\u89e3\u90e8\u5206\u62a4\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u62a4\u7406\u5bf9\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u4e3a\u62a4\u7406\u505a\u51c6\u5907\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u5bf9\u6210\u4e3a\u62a4\u7406\u8005\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u62a4\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2a\u4eba\u5bf9\u62a4\u7406\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u5907\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u62a4\u7406\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e2a\u4eba\u5bf9\u62a4\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u51c6\u5907\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u62a4\u7406\u8005\u548c\u975e\u62a4\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u62a4\u7406\u7684\u9884\u671f\u548c\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "findings": "\u9884\u671f\u6210\u4e3a\u62a4\u7406\u8005\u7684\u4eba\u90e8\u5206\u4e86\u89e3\u62a4\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u4f30\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51c6\u5907\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e2a\u4eba\u62a4\u7406\u51c6\u5907\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u62a4\u7406\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u62a4\u7406\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u63d0\u524d\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We examine whether these agents can learn to detect and exploit return predictability from public signals, decode prices to infer latent demand, and adjust for price impact. To evaluate performance, we compare AI traders to a rational benchmark representing the optimal policy under full knowledge of the data generating process. In simulations, AI traders qualitatively match the benchmark. Quantitatively, however, they fall short when many interact. The presence of other AI traders injects noise into the price process through their exploration, distorting the portfolio-return signals each agent learns from and thus impairing learning.

This gap hinders evidence-based health planning in a warming climate. We aimed to quantify the current and projected financial burden of heat-related hospital admissions in Switzerland. Methods: We linked daily hospital admissions (1998\u20132022) from six major Swiss cantons, representing 60% of the national total, to temperature records using a Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM) meta-analysis. Costs were estimated via the Swiss Diagnosis-Related Groups (SwissDRG) tariff system across different disease categories and age groups. Future climate projections were generated using CH2018 climate simulations with Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2- RCP4.5, SSP5-RCP8.5). Findings: Historically, extreme heat significantly increased hospital admissions in major Swiss regions, with endocrine/metabolic disorders showing the highest risk (Relative Risk 2.02). The elderly (75+) and children were the most vulnerable populations. The average annual cost of these direct hospitalizations across the six cantons studied was CHF 20.6 million (2013\u20132022), notably a conservative estimate representing only a fraction of the total economic burden. Future projections show this burden escalating sharply. Under a high-emissions pathway (SSP5-RCP8.5), these direct costs are projected to increase 2.5-fold by the 2060s, with costs for the elderly quintupling. Critically, even with aggressive mitigation (SSP1-RCP2.6), costs are still projected to triple compared to the baseline. This is driven primarily by demographic aging, with climate change acting as a significant amplifier, responsible for 15\u201330% of the projected cost increases for the elderly. Interpretation: Our findings from major Swiss regions reveal a substantial and growing financial burden on the healthcare system. Given that these figures represent a lower bound, the true costs are likely much higher. This evidence underscores the urgent need for nationally coordinated adaptation policies to protect public health and ensure healthcare sustainability, even as mitigation efforts continue.&nbsp;\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u745e\u58eb\u5f53\u524d\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u56e0\u9ad8\u6e29\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u6700\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u6765\u6210\u672c\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u56fd\u5bb6\u534f\u8c03\u9002\u5e94\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "research_question": "\u745e\u58eb\u9ad8\u6e29\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u5f53\u524d\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6e29\u76f8\u5173\u975e\u81f4\u547d\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u6696\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u745e\u58eb\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\uff08SwissDRG\uff09\u6536\u8d39\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\uff08CH2018\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6ede\u540e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLNM\uff09\u5c06\u4f4f\u9662\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8def\u5f84\uff08SSP\uff09\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u60c5\u666f\uff08RCP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "findings": "\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u6e29\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5185\u5206\u6ccc/\u4ee3\u8c22\u75be\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u9ad8\uff08RR 2.02\uff09\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u5e74\u5747\u6210\u672c\u4e3a2060\u4e07\u745e\u90ce\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u957f2.5\u500d\uff08\u9ad8\u6392\u653e\u60c5\u666f\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u9ad8\u6e29\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u534f\u8c03\u56fd\u5bb6\u653f\u7b56\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u533b\u7597\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002"}}

Imputation of all characteristics, including the observed ones, can be used as synthetic data to perform pseudo out-of-sample tests for cross-sectional asset pricing models."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f20\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u91cd\u586b\u8865\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f20\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u91cd\u586b\u8865\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f20\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\uff1b\u586b\u8865\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u56e0\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u51cf\u5c11\u663e\u8457alpha\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f20\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f2a\u6837\u672c\u5916\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Friction and unease have extended from the US-China rivalry and now involve traditional allies of the US. As a result, political and economic discourse about the possibility of decoupling has expanded to geoeconomic fragmentation. Among the possible outcomes of geoeconomic fragmentation is financial instability, a salient example of which is the recent increase in yields of US government bonds in response to the uncertainty spawned by the mercurial rollout of US tariffs. Asian economies can reduce their vulnerability to financial instability by strengthening their economic resilience. This can be achieved by improving their domestic financial institutions and deepening regional financial integration. Regional financial cooperation can support both of these objectives. An example is reinforcing the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization Stability Facility. Meanwhile, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership provides a ready-made platform for its members\u2019 political leaders to protect and project their multilateral interests.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7279\u6717\u666e2.0\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u201c\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f18\u5148\u201d\u653f\u7b56\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u7d27\u5f20\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e9a\u6d32\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5f3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u533a\u57df\u91d1\u878d\u5408\u4f5c\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "research_question": "\u201c\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f18\u5148\u201d\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5730\u7f18\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e9a\u6d32\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5f3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u533a\u57df\u91d1\u878d\u5408\u4f5c\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7279\u6717\u666e2.0\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u201c\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f18\u5148\u201d\u653f\u7b56\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u7d27\u5f20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7f8e\u4e2d\u7ade\u4e89\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u76df\u53cb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5730\u7f18\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5730\u7f18\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u88c2\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u533a\u57df\u91d1\u878d\u5408\u4f5c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u653f\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e9a\u6d32\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "findings": "\u4e9a\u6d32\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5f3a\u56fd\u5185\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u548c\u6df1\u5316\u533a\u57df\u91d1\u878d\u6574\u5408\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u91d1\u878d\u5408\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u6e05\u8fc8\u5021\u8bae\u591a\u8fb9\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff09\u662f\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5730\u7f18\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u88c2\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u91d1\u878d\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e9a\u6d32\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5982\u5229\u7528\u300a\u533a\u57df\u5168\u9762\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u534f\u5b9a\u300b\u5e73\u53f0\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u8fb9\u5229\u76ca\u3002"}}
