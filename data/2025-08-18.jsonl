However, it is an open question of whether the impact of management practices on the productivity of firms depends on workplace health promotion activities (alternatively called workplace wellness programs). Using a widely recognized management index developed by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), this study provides evidence that workplace health promotion moderates the link between management practices and productivity. Our panel data estimates show that the positive impact of management practices on productivity is stronger if a firm engages in workplace health promotion. This finding fits the notion that workplace health promotion mitigates adverse side effects of management practices on employees’ health. However, our estimates also provide evidence of a negative direct influence of workplace promotion on productivity. The positive moderating influence of workplace health promotion only dominates the negative direct influence if a firm uses Bloom and Van Reenen’s management practices (targets, monitoring and incentives) at a high intensity."}}

We argue that a larger proportion of managers in a specific functional subgroup within an executive team causes this group to focus the organization's strategic agenda on those issues that this functional subgroup considers most important. However, within a functional subgroup , the issues to which managers pay attention can vary between hierarchical levels, with senior managers' attention shaped by higher-level strategic schema, and lower-level managers' attention shaped by local, more operational stimuli. We test our theory using data from 1,064 U.S. hospitals, 6,218 executives, and Medicare-adjusted pricing for hospitals' shoppable services. Our analysis focuses on two key functional subgroups: the revenue subgroup , which focuses on financial sustainability, and the medical mission subgroup , focused on quality and accessible healthcare. We find that a higher proportion of revenue-focused managers at the system level is associated with higher insured pricing. In comparison, a higher proportion of system-level medical mission managers is associated with lower pricing. Interestingly, at the hospital level, a greater proportion of medical mission managers correlates with higher insured pricing, likely reflecting efforts to secure additional resources. Post-hoc analyses further clarify the mechanisms behind these relationships. Our results highlight that functional subgroups are not monolithic; their managers' perspectives can vary with their relative position in the organizational hierarchy, and this can provide an important mechanism of conflict resolution."}}

This chapter introduces the work orientations framework—a concept from psychology—as a unifying lens for understanding these motivations. Work orientations capture individuals’ core beliefs about the role of work: earning a living (“paycheck”), achieving recognition and advancement (“career”), or finding fulfillment (“calling”). These orientations are not mutually exclusive, and many people hold a mix that shapes their workplace behavior. Economists have long examined financial incentives, alignment with an organization’s mission, and career ambitions, but these strands remain fragmented. Integrating them within the work orientations framework broadens standard economic models, offers a richer view of labor supply and effort, and suggests new priorities for data collection, measurement, and theory development. The chapter reviews current evidence and outlines avenues for future empirical and conceptual research."}}

However, in the context of online ride-hailing platforms, the dynamics of sustainable commuting decision making and the accompanying cost remain less understood. To address this gap, we investigate the impact of a ride-hailing Platform Restriction (PR) policy implemented in a major metropolitan city in China on users' sustainable commuting behaviors. This policy implemented constraints on the accessibility of ride-hailing applications for selected taxi drivers during morning and evening rush hours on weekdays. Leveraging a unique dataset from a leading taxi company and public transit system, we reveal a notable shift in commuters' behaviors, with a substantial 38.1% and 64.4% surge in the utilization of metro services during the morning and evening restricted periods, respectively. Interestingly, we find that a 11.5% increase in the proportion of sustainable commuting choices, such as metro, prior to the restriction periods during morning rush hours. However, following the morning restriction period, there is a 45.4% decline in the proportion of metro utilization coupled with a rise in unsustainable commuting modes, indicating an asymmetric spillover effect. During evening hours, however, commuters exhibit a proactive inclination towards unsustainable commuting modes during the periods both before and after the restriction. Our moderation analysis reveals that the spillover effect is more pronounced among commuters with lower working arrangement flexibility, who thereby burden more of the cost of sustainable commuting. Specifically, among work-bound commuters, the proportion of metro usage exhibits a 27.1% greater increase prior to the implementation of the morning restriction, followed by a 16.1% greater decline afterward. Regarding the underlying mechanism, we find that commuting time cost and monetary cost play pivotal roles in shaping the observed within-day spillover effect. Building on these findings, we discuss the broader implications of this policy change."}}

Event-study regressions with fixed effects and placebo checks confirm that the change is abrupt, persistent, and not explained by pre-existing trends. A similarity experiment using OpenAI’s API shows that post-ChatGPT abstracts resemble their GPT-optimized versions more closely than pre-ChatGPT resemble theirs. A classifier, trained on these variants, flags a growing share of post-March 2023 texts as GPT-like. Rather than suggesting full automation, our findings indicate selective human–AI augmentation.

A central challenge in this domain is triangulation, where machine learning models infer protected group affiliation from permissible features, thereby introducing unintended discrimination even when sensitive attributes are excluded. While adversarial learning has recently shown substantial promise in promoting fairness in other domains, it is documented to often fail in credit risk applications due to noisy outcomes and misalignment with business objectives. Rather than suppress triangulation, we aim to harness its informational value to improve decision fairness and economic performance simultaneously. We propose a novel dual-objective adversarial deep learning framework that constructively leverages triangulation to address both fairness and profitability. Our model identifies and upweights two key borrower segments: the \"worst-off\" group, who face systematic disadvantage, and the \"least-exploited\" group, whose profit potential remains underrealized. By jointly optimizing borrower welfare and company profit through a dual-adversary design, we develop a unified training objective that can be tailored to organizational goals through interpretable parameters. Using proprietary data from a major microloan provider, we show that our model substantially outperforms standard baselines including XGBoost in both welfare and profit. These improvements are not reflected in traditional metrics such as AUC, highlighting the limitations of conventional evaluation frameworks. Our findings demonstrate an interpretable solution that transforms triangulation from a fairness liability into a mechanism for advancing ethical and economic goals in credit allocation."}}

Drawing on harmonic principles from Johannes Kepler and extending through foundational theories in physics (e.g., Bohm's implicate order, Zurek's decoherence theory), this work introduces the φ-Stability Principle: a framework demonstrating that recursive stability mechanisms optimised around the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) provide enhanced resilience against decoherence and resonance lock-in. We define recursive holonomy as the topological preservation of phase information across nested scales-a generalisation of Berry-phase-like memory-allowing coherence to be sustained non-locally. Cross-domain evidence shows that quasi-φ patterns, within a measured φ-distance (Dφ ≤ 0.05), consistently correlate with enhanced stability. This includes quantum biology (e.g., FMO complex coherence sustained for ~660 femtoseconds), exoplanetary N-body simulations (10-20% eccentricity suppression in φ-adjacent systems), and enzymatic quantum tunnelling. Rather than a universal law, φ-scaling functions as a diagnostic metric for identifying stability-optimised regimes where coherence and reasoning are topologically protected. The framework yields falsifiable predictions through Bayesian consilience testing across four domains: superconducting qubit coherence, robotic control architectures, protein folding simulations, and planetary dynamics. Practical applications include care robots, adaptive health diagnostics, and autonomous systems. Ethically, the φ-Stability Principle embeds stability-driven constraints into AI architectures, providing safeguards against destabilising ASI trajectories. By grounding alignment not only in Western paradigms but also in non-Western ethical frameworks , this approach emphasises global responsibility in the design of artificial sapience."}}

In the United States, retail-level waste is a significant contributor to overall food waste, as stores frequently face a trade-off between maximizing revenue and minimizing waste. This paper studies a grocery reservation scheme designed to mitigate waste at the retail level by allowing consumers to reserve items in advance at a discounted price. This scheme not only provides consumers the chance to buy items at a lower price, but it also benefits the retailer since it leads to reduced demand uncertainty and improved forecasting. We develop an analytical model to evaluate how such a scheme affects retailer profit and waste, showing that its effectiveness depends on the reservation price and exogenous factors such as costs and consumer characteristics. Moreover, we identify conditions under which the reservation scheme is Pareto-improving, meaning it can simultaneously reduce waste and increase profits compared to the traditional setting with a single retailer price. The analysis is then extended to assess the impact of the reservation scheme on the demand and waste of other store items."}}

Findings indicate a positive effect of digitalization on both FEI and MEI, affirming that digital readiness enhances entrepreneurial opportunities for all. However, in economies where MEI surpasses FEI, digitalization tends to widen the gender gap, with male entrepreneurs gaining a disproportionate advantage. Conversely, in contexts where female entrepreneurship dominates, digitalization does not significantly impact the MEI–FEI gap. Additional analyses reveal that factors like economic development (gross domestic product per capita) and gender inequalities (political empowerment of women) interact with digitalization to support both genders, though competitive environments are notably more influential on female entrepreneurial potential. These insights highlight the nuanced role of digitalization in fostering entrepreneurship, suggesting policies must consider these dynamics to effectively support gender-balanced growth in entrepreneurial ecosystems."}}

Currently, there is a palpable need for the fitting of a rather different forum—the mode of communication—to the fuss. This article discusses how parties can best customize the mediation process by fitting the “communication forum” to the “mediation fuss.” To understand the characteristics of communication forums, the article draws from a&nbsp;</span><span>range of disciplines to distil the relevant research on four modes of communication: face-to-face interaction, videoconferencing, audio calls, and text messaging. The article proposes discerning the “mediation fuss” by examining disputants’ objectives, likely obstacles to resolution, and the likely mediation model to be utilized. It argues that these factors enable the mediator to ascertain which of five goals are most applicable to the particular dispute: building of rapport and trust; facilitating mutual understanding of perspectives and interests; managing power imbalances and safety concerns; ensuring procedural justice; and encouraging creative and collaborative problem-solving. Relying on current research findings, the article analyzes the impact of differing communication forums on these five mediation goals. Lastly, it proposes a basic framework for fitting the communication forum to the mediation fuss. This framework aims to encourage mediators to consider, in consultation with the parties, the most appropriate communication mode to convene mediation for the particular dispute and to thoughtfully modify their mediation techniques and tools to suit the relevant communication mode.</span></p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>"}}

Living across borders to sustain a livelihood, I have witnessed firsthand how emotional intelligence (EI) shapes leadership, decision-making, and cross-cultural interactions qualities that artificial intelligence (AI) strives to replicate but cannot fully embody. This study emerges from both academic curiosity and personal experience, questioning whether artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) can ever match the depth, intuition, and ethical nuance of human intelligence (HI).</p>\n<p>Research Objectives:<br>\n  This paper critically examines the scope and limitations of AEI in replicating human emotional and cognitive processes, particularly in managerial and organizational contexts. Key objectives include:</p>\n<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span></span>Comparative Analysis: Contrasting the innate strengths of human emotional intelligence (e.g., empathy, moral judgment, cultural sensitivity) with AEI’s algorithmic mimicry.</p>\n<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span></span>Functional Boundaries: Investigating where AEI excels (e.g., data-driven emotional recognition, scalability) and where it fails (e.g., ethical ambiguity, contextual adaptability).</p>\n<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span></span>Practical Implications: Assessing how organizations can leverage AEI without undermining human-centric leadership, especially in multicultural settings like those I navigate as a global professional.</p>\n<p>Methodology: The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining: • A systematic literature review of HI and AEI in management theory. • Case studies of AI-driven emotional tools (e.g., HR analytics, customer service bots). • Qualitative interviews with experts in AI ethics and organizational behavior, reflecting my interest in bridging theory and lived experience.</p>\n<p>Key Findings: 1. Human Superiority in Nuance: HI remains irreplaceable in contexts requiring compassion, ethical discretion, and improvisation traits my multicultural upbringing and family dynamics have underscored. 2. AEI’s Mechanistic Limits: While AEI can simulate empathy via pattern recognition (e.g., sentiment analysis), it lacks authentic emotional understanding, often struggling with sarcasm, cultural idioms, or moral dilemmas. 3. Hybrid Potential: In management, AEI can augment (not replace) human roles, such as reducing bias in hiring or providing emotional well-being analytics tools I argue must be carefully regulated.</p>\n<p>Personal Reflections: As someone balancing academia, family, and transnational work, I recognize HI’s role in navigating uncertainty something AEI cannot replicate. My Lebanese heritage, where interpersonal connections (wasta) often override logic, further highlights the cultural gaps in AEI’s design. Conclusion &amp; Contribution: This paper contributes to the management and AI ethics discourse by: • Framing HI vs. AEI as complementary, not competitive. • Advocating for policies that preserve human oversight in emotionally sensitive domains. • Proposing a \"culturally adaptive AI\" model inspired by my cross-border experiences. Ultimately, while AEI transforms industries, the human touch shaped by love, ethics, and resilience, much like my family’s journey remains indispensable.</p>\n<p><br></p>"}}

While College Savings Accounts (CSAs), or 529 plans, offer tax-advantaged vehicles for college savings, their adoption patterns and educational impacts remain poorly understood. Using comprehensive administrative data from over 900,000 Illinois 529 accounts (2000-2023) linked to educational outcomes, plus complementary surveys of account owners and parents, we provide the first large-scale analysis of CSA participation and effectiveness. We find that while CSA adoption has expanded to every ZIP code in Illinois, participation remains concentrated among higher-income, more educated families. Financial literacy emerges as a key barrier: 61% of parents who could save enough to cover half of future college costs still perceive their potential savings as meaningless. Among participants, higher savings are strongly correlated with better educational outcomes, including four-year college enrollment, attendance at selective institutions, and the pursuit of post-graduate degrees. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing financial literacy gaps and misperceptions about modest savings could significantly expand CSA effectiveness as a tool for educational equity. Beyond state-level 529 program optimization, our findings suggest several promising avenues for federal policy coordination and institutional innovation.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34126\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Rising economic nationalism, resurgent great power competition, and climate-skeptic populism in high-income democracies are undermining the ability of these institutions to coordinate around climate solutions. Facing these pressures, regional and plurilateral arrangements will be increasingly important for providing paths forward. This paper explores the concept of \"tied aid\" as a means of meeting the global South's need for large transfers in a context of increasing economic nationalism. It also highlights the pivotal role of countries other than the United States and China in sustaining and reforming global governance in a multipolar world. Although not first-best solutions, these approaches may be the most politically feasible strategies for advancing global climate mitigation, adaptation, and finance in the near future. <br><br>Note: Version of the chapter originally published in Spanish and written for El Club Español de la Energía's publication \"<a href=\"https://www.enerclub.es/libros/eg2025/\">Energy and Geostrategy 2025</a>.\" Republished in English with permission."}}

We study both the internal governance mechanisms (boards of directors, incentive contracts) and external mechanisms (market for corporate control, government oversight), with particular focus on the latter. Nonprofit boards are unusually large, include employee directors, exhibit less industry expertise among outside directors, and face weak external oversight. CEO pay and turnover are largely unresponsive to non-financial metrics such as quality or charity provision. The disciplinary role of the market for corporate control is also weaker in the nonprofit sector: nonprofits with poor financial performance are half as likely to be acquired or closed as for-profits, and weak performance on non-financial metrics has no effect on acquisitions or closures. Using time-series and cross-sectional variation in state oversight of nonprofits, we find that oversight strength explains a substantial portion of the gap in takeover rates between for-profits and nonprofits. We conclude that nonprofit governance structures lack the attributes traditionally associated with “good governance.”<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34132\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

The most notable is the sharp rise in the relative household wealth of age group 75 and over. Correspondingly, the relative wealth holdings of all other age groups dropped over these years. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, the paper focuses on the youngest age group, 35 and under, and the oldest age group, 75 and over, and analyzes the factors behind these relative shifts in wealth. I find that the three principal factors are the homeownership rate, total stocks directly and indirectly owned, and home mortgage debt. The homeownership rate is the same in the two years for the youngest group but falls relative to the overall rate, whereas it shoots up for the oldest group both in actual level and relative to the overall average. The value of stock holdings rises for both age groups but vastly more for the oldest households compared to the youngest ones and accounts for a substantial portion of the elderly’s relative wealth gains. Mortgage debt rises in dollar terms for both groups but considerably more in relative terms for the youngest group.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34131\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

First-generation students enter college less informed and with more uncertain beliefs, facing substantial challenges stemming from limited understanding and uncertainty about the higher education setting. A Bayesian expected utility maximization model demonstrates that higher uncertainty alone can sustain persistent achievement gaps. Empirically, students update their beliefs and make academic decisions consistent with the model’s predictions.

Using data from the National Survey of College Graduates and other sources, we decompose the gender earnings gap across birth cohorts into three components: (i) gender differences in the relative returns to undergraduate and graduate fields, (ii) gender-specific trends in undergraduate field, graduate degree attainment, and graduate field, and (iii) a cohort-specific “residual component” that shifts the gender gap uniformly across all college graduates. We have three main findings. First, when holding the relative returns to fields constant, changes in fields of study contribute 0.128 to the decline in the gender gap. However, this decline is partially offset by cohort trends in the relative returns to specific fields that favored men over women, reducing the contribution of field-of-study changes to the decline to 0.055. Second, gender differences in the relative returns to undergraduate and graduate fields of study contribute to the earnings gap, but they play a limited role in explaining its decline over time. Third, much of the convergence in earnings between the 1931 and 1950 cohorts is due to a declining “residual component.” The residual component remains stable for cohorts born between 1951 and the late 1970s, after which it resumes its decline.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34133\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

However, in landscapes with strong cultural ties, changes have been shown to be divisive for the public. Yet, empirical evidence on economic impacts of rewilding is scarce. In this study, we use the choice experiment method to value the rewilding of a cultural landscape in a densely populated region, using the Dutch riverine floodplains as a case study. We estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for changes in the regulation of river flow, presence of grazing animals as well as recreational access. We also address two important sub-hypotheses regarding the valuation of rewilding: the influence of the initial state of the landscape on value estimates and the effect of informing respondents about biodiversity impacts of landscape changes. We find high WTP for abiotic and biotic rewilding, for recreational access and find that most respondents prefer nature-inclusive agriculture in the floodplains. Preferences are, however, very heterogeneous, with significant opposition to changing the landscape. Preferences depend on the initial state of the landscape, with more opposition to intervening in nature than in agriculture. We find that providing biodiversity information only affects WTP to a limited degree, and find scope-insensitive WTP estimates. Our results indicate that the Dutch public generally prefers extensive abiotic rewilding efforts over intermediate or minimal rewilding, though nearly half of the population would experience a welfare loss from shifting away from an agrarian landscape."}}

We study the effects of this practice by combining a field experiment that hides brands owned by Amazon (i.e., private labels) from shoppers on Amazon.com with model-based counterfactuals and welfare analysis.  In the absence of private labels, consumers substitute toward products that are similar along most observable dimensions. Removing Amazon brands does not change consumers&apos; search effort or their propensity to shop at other retail websites. Despite the ample availability of observably similar alternatives, our welfare estimates imply that, for the categories we study, removing Amazon brands would reduce consumer surplus by 5.5 percent in the short run, with approximately 10 percent of the impact due to equilibrium price increases by other sellers. The effects are heterogeneous, with consumer surplus reductions exceeding 10 percent in some categories, while other categories realize much smaller decreases when Amazon brands are removed. Demoting private labels in search results to counteract potential self-preferencing does not lead to gains in consumer surplus. This outcome arises because a subset of consumers derive greater utility from private labels and benefit from their high placement in search results.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34135\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

The index we propose, the ”Global Gender Distortions Index (GGDI)”, measures the losses in aggregate productivity that gender-based misallocation imposes. Our index allows us to separately identify labor demand distortions (e.g., discrimination in hiring for formal jobs) from labor supply distortions (e.g., frictions that discourage women’s labor force participation) and can be computed using data on labor income and job types. Our methodology also highlights an important distinction between welfare-relevant misallocation and the consequences on aggregate GDP if misallocation arises between market work and non-market activities. To showcase the versatility of our index, we analyze gender misallocation within countries over time, across countries over the development spectrum, and across local labor markets within countries.

Validating our approach, wages fall in markets with higher vs. lower union premia following a nationwide right-to-work law.

Our analysis leverages newly digitized data on power plant siting and operations from 1900-2020, combined with spatially resolved demographics and population data from the U.S Census from 1870-2020. We find little evidence that fossil-fuel plants were disproportionately sited in counties with higher Black population shares on average. However, event study estimates indicate that Black population share grows in the decades after the first fossil-fuel plant is built in a county, with average increases in Black population share of 4 percentage points in the 50-70 years after first siting. These long-run demographic shifts are driven by counties that first hosted a fossil-fuel plant between 1900-1949. We close by exploring how these long-run demographic shifts were shaped by the Great Migration, differential sorting in response to pollution, and other factors. Our findings highlight that the equity implications of siting long-lived infrastructure can differ dramatically depending on the time span considered."}}

We study how different framings of mental health investment affect cooperation and donations using a pre-registered online experiment across five European countries (N = 8,312). Participants were randomly assigned to receive information emphasizing either individual benefits (Private Perspective), collective benefits (Public Perspective), or prevalence data (Neutral Perspective). All treatments significantly increase cooperation in a Public Goods Game and donations in a Charity Dictator Game, suggesting intrinsic motivation drives behavior. Only the Private Perspective increases personal normative expectations, while empirical expectations remain unaffected—suggesting that interventions influence moral beliefs more than beliefs about others’ actions. All treatments reduce self-reported mental health stigma, consistent with evidence from a list experiment, suggesting stigma reduction as a key mechanism. Heterogeneity analyses show stronger treatment effects among individuals with lived experience or prior concern, and reduced contributions under collective framings when public provision is perceived as adequate—consistent with a substitution effect between public and private action. Donations also decline in postcommunist countries, aligning with historically lower institutional trust and weaker norms of private giving. These findings highlight how individual perceptions and institutional legacies shape behavioural responses, and suggest that perceived adequacy of public provision can backfire by discouraging private engagement—potentially trapping societies in a bad equilibrium of persistent underinvestment in mental health."}}

It begins by examining how culture provides meaning to illness and suffering and explores how culturally grounded “disease theory systems” influence beliefs about what causes illness, how and whether suffering should be remedied, and the appropriate role of the state in allocating health care resources. The importance of culture in defining the boundary between normal and abnormal pathology is highlighted via case studies. The chapter next reviews evidence on how health behaviors such as smoking, firearm ownership, dietary practices, and reproductive decisions are influenced by cultural norms of masculinity and religiosity. Lastly, it examines how firms, governments, and civil society leverage and advance cultural narratives to influence individual behavior and public policy. Thus, culture in relation to health both naturally evolves and is actively constructed, with implications for health inequality and health policy.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34134\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Using linked employer-employee data from Brazil and job moves across multi-firm unions, we estimate over 4,800 union-specific pay premia. Unions explain 3-4% of earnings variation. While unions raise wages on average, the standard deviation in union effects is large (6-7%). Validating our approach, wages fall in markets with higher vs. lower union premia following a nationwide right-to-work law. Linking premia to detailed data on union attributes, we find that unions with strike activity, collective bargaining agreements, internal competition, and skilled leaders secure higher wages. High-premium unions compress wage gaps by education while the average union exacerbates them. Post right-to-work, however, worker support for high-premium unions falls when between-group bargaining differentials are large. Our findings show that unions are not a monolith-their structure and actions shape their wage effects and, consequently, worker support."}}

Using a large-scale randomized survey experiment in Germany, we vary both the focus (top vs. bottom of the income distribution) and the delivery (subtle priming vs. factual information) of inequality cues. We document three key findings. First, simply directing respondents' attention to different ends of the distribution shifts redistributive preferences—especially when focusing on the rich. Second, information about top incomes has a larger effect than equivalent information about the poor, revealing asymmetric responses. Third, while both priming and information temporarily influence attitudes, these effects fade within one year. Our findings help reconcile mixed results in the literature and underscore the importance of framing, informational content, and message durability in shaping redistribution preferences."}}

If so, what drives these differences? We address these questions using a novel dataset that combines administrative tax records with unique survey data on the social and economic preferences of workers in Uruguay. We document a marked decline in support for redistribution among the Top 1% of the income distribution. Comparing this group with the Top 50-2%, we show that differences in support for redistribution are not solely explained by current income or demographics. A set of beliefs, perceptions, and views, including political ideology, meritocratic beliefs, and views on government, account for much of the observed differences. Instead, a set of behavioral traits and social preferences, such as altruism and risk aversion, measured through incentivized online games, contribute little to explaining the gap. Finally, the differences in support for redistribution persist even when comparing the Top 1% with otherhigh-incomegroups. Together, these findings suggest that the Top 1% is a distinct group with preferences for redistribution that differ from the rest of society, even from other high-income groups."}}

Using PISA 2022 data and a school fixed effects model, we investigate the relationship between two measures of relative SES—Socioeconomic Rank and Socioeconomic Gap—and a range of outcomes, including socioemotional skills, self-esteem, and attitudes toward school. Our results show that higher within-school SES rank is significantly associated with better socioemotional skills, greater well-being, and stronger academic motivation. We also find important heterogeneity by gender and migrant background. These findings highlight that an individual’s relative socioeconomic position, beyond absolute resources, plays a critical role in shaping adolescent non-cognitive development."}}

Utilizing data on risk-taking behaviors among college students, alongside variables reflecting parent-child relationships in the family of origin, we derive classifications of parenting styles. The empirical findings reveal that individuals exposed to authoritarian parenting, and to a lesser extent, permissive parenting, demonstrate an increased propensity for engaging in diverse risk-taking behaviors, both in frequency and intensity. Conversely, authoritative parenting appears to exert a partial mitigating influence on these behaviors.

While investment-led growth may offer quick wins, it is efficiency, innovation, and institutional reform that will determine Ukraine’s long-term economic trajectory. Drawing on rich micro-level firm data spanning 25 years, this paper uncovers deep structural distortions that have suppressed creative destruction and productivity in Ukraine. It finds that business dynamism is on the decline, alongside rising market concentration among incumbent businesses, including low productivity state owned enterprises. To inform priorities for reviving business dynamism, this study develops a model of creative destruction drawing on Acemoglu et al. (2018) and Akcigit et al. (2021). The quantitative assessment highlights that policies that discipline entrenched incumbents are the bedrock for reviving business dynamism and engineer Ukraine’s Wirtschaftswunder. Policies targeting specific types of firms have limited efficacy when incumbents run wild.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34103\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Leveraging the staggered rollout of a school orchestra program as a quasi-experimental setting, we identify the causal impact of adolescent musical engagement. Our findings reveal that music training significantly improves both emotional intelligence and mental health into young adulthood. Specifically, musical proficiency fosters key non-cognitive traits, including self-motivation, optimism and adaptability, while also mitigating symptoms of poor mental health, including depression and anxiety. These positive effects are particularly pronounced for males and second-generation migrants. Our evidence demonstrates that learning music has a lasting positive impact on non-cognitive skills, suggesting that universal educational music programs can be a powerful, long-term tool for human capital development and inequality reduction."}}

Exploiting a unique episode in the history of the National University of Singapore, in which a university-wide revision in graduation requirements in 2007 prompted students in a large faculty to unexpectedly read a more specialized curriculum, we find, using a difference-in-differences approach, that while taking a more specialized curriculum does not initially affect labor earnings shortly after graduation, its effect becomes negative and increases with work experience. We find no evidence that lower earnings are due to a lower propensity to switch jobs, suggesting weaker within-firm earnings trajectories among more specialized graduates."}}

Partnering with a recruitment firm, we conducted a natural field experiment in which 70,000 applicants were randomly assigned to be interviewed by human recruiters, AI voice agents, or given a choice between the two. In all three conditions, human recruiters evaluated interviews and made hiring decisions based on applicants' performance in the interview and a standardized test. Contrary to the forecasts of professional recruiters, we find that AI-led interviews increase job offers by 12%, job starts by 18%, and 30-day retention by 17% among all applicants. Applicants accept job offers with a similar likelihood and rate interview, as well as recruiter quality, similarly in a customer experience survey. When offered the choice, 78% of applicants choose the AI recruiter, and we find evidence that applicants with lower test scores are more likely to choose AI. Analyzing interview transcripts reveals that AI-led interviews elicit more hiring-relevant information from applicants compared to human-led interviews. Recruiters score the interview performance of AI-interviewed applicants higher, but place greater weight on standardized tests in their hiring decisions. Overall, we provide evidence that AI can match human recruiters in conducting job interviews while preserving applicants' satisfaction and firm operations."}}

This map can be useful for macroprudential authorities in regularly monitoring interconnections, contagion channels and systemic risk dynamics. We develop three extensions to the map that should increase its relevance: (i) the use of euro area Distributional Wealth Accounts to consider households according to their wealth; (ii) a breakdown of the other financial institutions sector into other financial intermediaries, financial auxiliaries, and captive financial institutions and money lenders; and (iii) using international investment position data to compute exposures to the rest of the world by country. In addition to the series codes on the ECB Data Portal to retrieve the relevant data, we illustrate the potential analytical application of each of the three extensions. In a nutshell, our analysis of the euro area household sector according to wealth shows that the aggregate figures conceal significant heterogeneity. Using data from the quarterly sectoral accounts, we are able to gain a clearer overview of other financial institutions, identifying the links with banks through securitisation vehicles and with non-financial corporations through captive financial institutions. Finally, although we cannot match exactly all the financial instruments in the balance sheet, data on the institutional investment position shows, among others, a continuous increase in the portfolio investments of euro area residents in the United States since 2013."}}

We find evidence that this mechanism incentivizes amplification of variation in year-to-year hydroelectric production, reflecting profit-maximizing behavior by firms to have years with low levels of production (earning no RECs, but storing additional water in dams) followed by years with relatively high levels of production (releasing more water to earn extra RECs). We further document that the year-on-year production distortions are offset by fossil-fuel production, but in a manner that has the potential to increase carbon emissions. We discuss motives for including pre-existing facilities in such a scheme, and options for removing the non-linearity of the policy rule that drives the year-to-year operating incentives."}}

This work explicitly quantifies trade barrier probability using an ensemble of several machine learning classifiers, with probability estimates informed by exogenous variables such as prior trade barrier implementation and global export dominance.

These products blend credit derivative instruments, repackaging techniques, and securitization technologies to offer investors tailored exposure to diverse credit risks and corresponding returns. A foundational understanding of credit default swaps (CDS) and credit-linked notes (CLNs) is essential to grasp the mechanics of these instruments. While the complexity and use of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in structured credit transactions have attracted scrutiny, the presence of these features does not inherently indicate elevated risk. When properly structured, disclosed, and utilized, structured credit products serve as sophisticated financial tools that enable precise identification, transfer, and allocation of credit risk to parties best suited to bear it. This risk allocation enhances market efficiency by aligning risk and reward among participants. This paper examines various types of structured credit products, emphasizing their design, economic implications, and their role within broader credit risk management frameworks."}}

Using a comparative case study approach, we analyze ghost soldier practices in Uganda, Afghanistan, and Iraq, identifying key patterns of institutional corruption, weak governance, and donor-enabled mismanagement. We propose an analytical model-the \"Ghost Soldier Trap\"-which maps the interplay between military commanders, civilian authorities, and donor agencies, highlighting the systemic incentives that sustain the practice. Our findings suggest that security assistance programs, when implemented without robust oversight and governance reforms, often reinforce the very corruption they aim to prevent. We conclude by offering policy recommendations that emphasize the need for greater transparency, civilian oversight, and accountability mechanisms to disrupt this entrenched form of military corruption and mitigate its broader security risks."}}

On this view, tax insurance-a financial product allowing taxpayers to shift tax risk to an insurer for a fee-is merely a hedge against the IRS's potential disagreement with any given tax position. With this understanding in mind, some commentators have proposed imposing restrictions on tax insurance so that the IRS, not taxpayers, can harness its full potential.&nbsp; \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n This Article offers a different account of tax uncertainty and tax insurance. It argues that persistent tax law uncertainty is not a brute fact, but a policy choice. In contrast to general principles of administrative law, the Anti-Injunction Act bars pre-enforcement judicial review for taxpayers, forcing them to transact first and litigate later. Thus, while substantive complexity might create tax uncertainty, that uncertainty persists because of procedure. Viewed in this light, tax insurance functions as a synthetic pre-enforcement challenge, enabling taxpayers to resolve tax risk reliably.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n This Article therefore urges caution before restricting the tax insurance market. Yet, as the industry grows, tax insurance might evolve in ways that no longer mimic pre-enforcement review. Accordingly, some policy changes are appropriate. Subject to certain conditions, this Article proposes clarifying the tax treatment of tax insurance itself, aligning it with the tax treatment of a would-be pre-enforcement challenge.\n</div>"}}

At scale, the intervention is cost-effective, complementing and potentially lessening the need for costly water capacity investments like desalination plants."}}

We compare profits under the two forms of contracts and find under weak conditions that when negative fixed fees would arise in the case of two-part tari↵s, at least one side and often both sides will prefer this outcome to the outcome that would arise with linear contracts. In contrast, the opposite holds when positive fixed fees would arise in the case of two-part tari↵s. Using linear demands, we demonstrate that retailers always favor negotiating over twopart tari↵s when the fixed fees are negative, and prefer linear contracts when the fixed fees are positive. Suppliers generally share these preferences, unless they possess particularly strong bargaining power relative to retailers. Our findings have implications for retailer buyer power and are broadly consistent with stylized facts from the U.S. grocery industry."}}

We argue that the success of such compensation also depends on the bureaucracies tasked with implementing it. Specifically, bureaucratic delays in delivering benefits to affected workers can erode trust in the government's capacity to mitigate the adverse effects of import competition, thereby weakening public support for international integration. We test this theory using the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. Leveraging quasi-random assignment of TAA petitions to individual bureaucrats, we find that bureaucrat-driven delays in processing petitions shift voting behavior and public attitudes in the affected communities against international integration and the government. The effects are stronger where information about TAA delays is more likely to reach citizens. Our findings highlight broader political consequences of bureaucratic performance than previously considered."}}

Minimum wages have grown in real levels over the last three decades, particularly among high-skilled occupations, but this growth has been partially eroded by the 2022-2023 inflation crisis. Nominal minimum wage growth is strongly correlated with past inflation and very weakly correlated with sectoral productivity growth and unemployment dynamics, which is consistent with strong coordination across industries and real wage rigidity. Increasing differences between high- and low-skilled occupation minimum wages can explain around one-third of the overall growth in the inequality of full-time equivalent daily wages that has occurred in Italy during the 1990s."}}

For that substantial investment, we get a system that actually deepens wealth inequality. The top 10% of earners capture 60% of the associated tax benefits, and employer matching contributions disproportionately favor the highest earners. Although defined contribution plans have long been subject to non-discrimination requirements aimed at ensuring that benefits do not accrue predominantly to the wealthiest participants, these rules have little bite. In an irony, we estimate that the entire 401(k) system would fail the non-discrimination test that every employer offering such a plan is expected to pass. This Article examines the structural causes of these disparities, including growing income inequality, critiques the shortcomings of the non-discrimination rules, and proposes practical reforms to the 401(k) system, alongside a supporting increase in the minimum wage. Our reforms would realign public policy to address the related needs for more economic equality and to provide equitable incentives for retirement savings for the many, not just the few. Ultimately, these reform proposals seek to get the most value for the American public out of the considerable retirement tax expenditures under §401(k)."}}

To investigate, we propose a dynamic state-space model of knowledge accumulation, in which test scores are imperfect measures of knowledge, and students receive temporary and persistent shocks to their stock of knowledge each period.  The model identifies two primary sources of bias: transient factors in baseline scores (measurement error or transitory effects of prior teachers) and heterogeneous student growth rates.  We propose diagnostic tests and corrections for each.  Using eleven years of data from North Carolina, we find little evidence of heterogeneous student growth.  Rather, the primary source of bias is attenuation of the baseline coefficient, which opens the door to selection on correlates of true baseline knowledge.  Although conventional value-added estimates are biased for individual teachers due to attenuation, we find they are forecast unbiased when applied across a sample of teachers, due to the offsetting relationship between bias and teachers’ true effectiveness.  When achievement follows the state-space model and there is no heterogeneity in growth rates, the attenuation-corrected value-added model (ACVAM) should yield unbiased estimates of a wide range educational interventions, not just teachers and schools.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34119\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

The extreme time difference meant that US-based fans sacrificed significant sleep to watch live matches. We track fatal car accidents in areas with large German populations on days when the German national team played early morning games. Areas with greater than 30% German heritage experienced increases in fatal car accidents of 35% relative to control areas after German games. The effects are dose-dependent and rise as the share of the German population increases. Our results are larger for crucial tournament games and non-alcohol-related incidents, consistent with sleep-deprived driving. Effects are driven by male drivers, mirroring World Cup viewer demographics. Placebo tests using the 2006 World Cup, where no games were played during normal U.S. sleeping hours, confirm that sleep disruption, not the sporting event itself, drives our findings."}}

Using panel data from the Young Lives study in Peru (Rounds 4 and 5), the analysis exploits exogenous variation in female employment opportunities across departments through a shift-share instrument. Results show that improvements in women’s local labor demand reduce the likelihood that mothers expect emotional or financial support from their children in adulthood. These lower expectations are, in turn, associated with improved socio-emotional development among adolescents, captured through standardized indices of self-esteem, self-efficacy, peer relations, and pride. The findings suggest that economic expansion may relax intergenerational expectations of support, thereby reducing the psychological burdens placed on children. This study contributes to research on gendered labor shocks, parental beliefs, and the socio-emotional consequences of intergenerational dynamics, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, showing how economic change can influence child development through shifts in maternal expectations."}}

Using cross-country data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the study presents stylized facts and investigates cross-sectional associations between governance, inequality, and parenting behaviors.

The first major part (Chapters 1-5) provides an overview of the field and then focuses on regulatory intervention: how the government, through law, regulates the behavior of employers. The following section (Chapter 6) investigates questions regarding the constitutionality of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and Mine Safety and Health Act, an issue that has become more salient in 2025. The second major part (Chapters 7-8) turns the focus to the rights of workers. Chapter 7 asks: When can workers affect the health and safety in their workplaces, and what are the protections against retaliation for raising safety concerns or refusing dangerous work? This necessitates looking at these issues through a broader work law lens, including the National Labor Relations Act, collective bargaining agreements, and the common law. Chapter 8 explores the question: What kinds of protections are available for workers who are injured on the job? Here, the focus turns to questions of compensation and employment rights for workers with persistent disabilities arising out of work, as well as the right of employers to exclude workers who pose a safety risk to themselves or others.

We show how to identify these wedges for a large panel of countries using limited publicly available data on national accounts and external asset and liability positions since the 1970s. Our analysis reveals striking cross-country differences in the pace and direction of financial account opening: wealthier countries have become relatively more open to foreign capital inflows, while poorer countries have become relatively more open to capital outflows, a phenomenon we call “Unbalanced Financial Globalization.” Counterfactual simulations show that this unbalanced financial globalization has worsened capital allocation, resulting in a 5.9% decrease in world GDP, a 3.4% rise in cross-country income inequality, lower wages in poorer countries, and a decline in rates of return on capital in richer countries. In contrast, if financial account opening had been uniform, the improved allocation of capital would have reduced income inequality, and increased global GDP. These findings underscore the crucial role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping the real impact of international capital markets integration.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34121\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that, to increase federal matching funds, such schemes distort the quality-quantity tradeoff. In Indiana, exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the rollout of a creative financing scheme, we find a disproportionate expansion of Medicaid-funded care for dementia patients in the lowest-quality nursing facilities."}}

We develop an equilibrium model of tariff administration with costly verification of declared values that explains these twin trends: Administrative capacity allows Customs officials to disaggregate goods and assess tailored specific tariffs, obviating misvaluation while minimizing price distortions.

While there is no contradiction here, our study highlights crucial differences between mobility measures based on (lower) persistence and those based on growth progressivity, and asks the reader to align their choice of measure with foundational criteria that they feel best describe “mobility\".

Quantitatively, eliminating global agricultural tariffs has limited impacts on global forest area, leads to substantial forest reallocation across countries, and results in net welfare benefits<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34150\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

They operate as a form of commons, sustained by mutual recognition, shared values, and trust between organisers, contributors, and audiences. This article develops a framework linking Kenneth Boulding's \"gift\" logic (Boulding, 1962) to Elinor Ostrom's commons governance principles (Ostrom, 1990, 2005) and integrates a governance friction continuum to explain how legitimacy is sustained, eroded, and sometimes contested. We argue that acts of \"performative power\", such as public withdrawals or boycotts, can function as governance interventions within the commons, emerging when perceived breaches of transparency, proportionality, or shared decision-making threaten trust. Using the recent Bendigo Writers Festival walkout as a case study, we show how governance drift can move a cultural commons from harmony into friction or conflict, and how recalibrating governance can restore alignment. The model has wider application for cultural institutions, event governance, and the protection of participatory legitimacy in public institutions."}}

Building on recent frameworks for knowledge creation and decision making under uncertainty, it distinguishes between specialists, who engage in costly “on the spot” reasoning to generate tacit knowledge around a focal point, and generalists, who search for and interpolate existing knowledge but deliver answers subject to error.  The model characterises how these two types of workers should be allocated across a continuum of questions, given the location of codified knowledge points and the distribution of problems.  It shows that optimal task assignment depends on the cognitive process through which information is processed rather than on skill endowments or task complexity.  When specialists operate around both knowledge points, their allocation is shaped by their absolute advantage over generalists, leading to non‐contiguous specialist domains interspersed with generalist regions.  When specialists cluster around a single point, a natural boundary emerges between specialist and generalist domains that shifts but persists despite changes in question distribution.  Extending the analysis to a two‐period setting, the paper identifies when specialists should sacrifice static efficiency to codify their tacit discoveries, creating bridges that allow generalists to operate more effectively in the future.  These results provide a formal microfoundation for Babbage’s insights into the division of cognitive labour and offer predictions about how knowledge work responds to changes in the knowledge environment, the distribution of questions, and the patience of capital.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34145\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

It is known that companies incur significant additional costs during financial distress prior to bankruptcy, when interest obligations exceed operating earnings, but this is ignored in the corporate finance literature. We show that costly financial distress will cause firms to choose significantly lower leverage ratios, and will result in a higher investment trigger (delayed investment), but the quantitative effect on investment trigger is small. However, the resulting delay in investing is economically significant, particularly when earnings volatility and tax rate are high and earnings growth rate is low. The major implication of our model is that costly financial distress prior to bankruptcy has a significant impact on both leverage ratio and investment timing. Therefore, models of capital structure and investment should incorporate financial distress cost, which can be done with a simple adjustment to the existing models."}}

One-time transfers of USD 1000 were provided to over 10,500 poor households across 653 randomized villages in Kenya. We collected census data on over 100,000 births, including on mortality and cause of death, and detailed data on household health behaviors. Unconditional cash transfers (accounting for spillovers) lead to 48% fewer infant deaths before age one and 45% fewer child deaths before age five. Detailed data on cause of death, transfer timing relative to birth, and the location of health facilities indicate that unconditional cash transfers and access to delivery care are complements in generating mortality reductions: the largest gains are estimated in neonatal and maternal causes of death largely preventable by appropriate obstetric care and among households living close to physician-staffed facilities and those who receive the transfer around the time of birth, and treatment leads to a large increase in hospital deliveries (by 45%). The infant and child mortality declines are concentrated among poorer households with below median assets or predicted consumption. The transfers also result in a substantial decline of 51% in female labor supply in the three months before and the three months after a birth, and improved child nutrition.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, we compare U.S. firms, which were directly exposed to the reform, with a matched sample of non-U.S. firms around the TCJA’s enactment. We find that U.S. borrowers experienced a significant reduction in loan spreads following the reform, consistent with lenders updating their expectations of improved firm cash flowsand creditworthiness. The decline in loanspreadsis morepronouncedamong firms with greater foreign exposure, higher tax savings, and tighter ex ante financial constraints. Additionally, we document adjustments in U.S. corporate borrowers’ non-pricing loan terms, including a higher likelihood of covenant-lite provisions and a reduced incidence of collateral and performance pricing requirements. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of corporate tax policy in shaping financial contracting in private credit markets."}}

Despite years of digitalisation efforts, the NHS has largely failed to overhaul entrenched, outdated practices dating back to its inception in 1948. Instead, it has applied superficial technological upgrades without fundamentally rethinking healthcare delivery for the post-digital era. The next decade presents a key opportunity to embrace AI not just as a new tool, but as a catalyst for comprehensive, systemic change—redefining workflows, roles, data connectivity, and care models to create an integrated, intelligent health and wellness service. Achieving this shift requires breaking down legacy silos, encouraging innovation, adopting new skills, and implementing AI ethically and responsibly. As the NHS pivots from focusing solely on treating illness to an emphasis on prevention and community care, it will need a data-driven culture to support AI-enabled empowerment for both patients and staff. Realising this vision will require a fundamental change in mindset and governance to unlock AI’s full potential in delivering sustainable healthcare innovation, operational efficiency, and better patient outcomes.</span></p>"}}

Using a mixed-methods research design, data were collected from 370 SMEs through structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with SME operators and Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) officials. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between digital taxation, tax compliance, and SME sustainability, while thematic analysis was applied to qualitative responses. The findings reveal that adoption of e-tax platforms such as TaxPro-Max and e-payment systems is high, though formal training participation remains moderate. Digital taxation shows a strong positive correlation with tax compliance (r = 0.692, p &lt; 0.05) and significantly influences financial performance, explaining 37.3% of its variation. Tax incentives were found to significantly moderate the relationship between digital taxation and SME sustainability. Qualitative insights indicate benefits such as time savings and transparency, alongside challenges related to internet infrastructure, cybersecurity, and technical support. The study concludes that digital taxation is a critical tool for improving SME compliance and financial performance in Nigeria. It recommends targeted taxpayer education, enhanced digital infrastructure, strengthened cybersecurity measures, and better management of tax incentives to maximize the benefits of e-tax systems."}}

It distinguishes between event-driven geopolitical risk and structural political divides, showing that both influence international investment through retrenchment and alignment-based reallocation. Using gravity models, the literature documents a growing role of political distance in shaping foreign direct investment and portfolio flows, particularly in emerging markets, strategic sectors, and in the euro area since the invasion of Ukraine. Open questions include the macroeconomic consequences of financial fragmentation, its impact on the global financial cycle, and implications for the role of reserve currencies."}}

The 2022 Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act centralized health services, replacing 20 district health boards with a single national entity, Health New Zealand, and establishing a dedicated Māori Health Authority. In 2024 a new government reinstated five national performance targets and abolished the Māori Health Authority. How services have performed in this context is an important question which this study reports on.&nbsp;\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Methods: We conducted a retrospective interrupted time-series study using quarterly data from Q1 2010 to Q3 2024 for four national targets: emergency department stays, faster cancer treatment, first specialist assessments, and elective surgery. Data covered national, regional, and 20 legacy district series. We employed multilevel segmented regression to quantify trends and assess the causal effects of key policy milestones, including the announcement (April 2021) and implementation (July 2022) of Pae Ora reforms, and the reinstatement of national targets (July 2024). Vector Autoregression (VAR) models were used for multivariate forecasting, and a screening-level value-of-information (VOI) analysis estimated the decision value of moving from quarterly to monthly performance reporting.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Findings: National performance across all targets showed a steady decline from 2016, accelerating sharply after the July 2022 centralization. Comprehensive Interrupted Time Series analysis across 80 unique time series revealed heterogeneous impacts, with some areas experiencing immediate drops or trend shifts, though not uniformly significant. Regional analysis highlighted disparities in reform effects. VAR models, accounting for interdependencies between measures, significantly outperformed univariate ARIMA models and a Grand Means Forecaster in forecasting accuracy (e.g., average MAE of 0.0214 for VAR vs. 0.0502 for ARIMA). All VOI scenarios indicated negative expected net benefit for switching to monthly reporting, with the largest Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) being 16,500 resource units.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Interpretation: The 2022 centralization appears to have accelerated pre-existing deterioration in service timeliness and exacerbated local inequities. This indicates that policymakers, in New Zealand and elsewhere, should carefully consider the impact on service delivery performance before embarking on major reforms. Quarterly monitoring remains a cost-effective approach, as monthly reporting offers only marginal additional information. To improve performance and address inequities, future policy should prioritize equity-weighted targets and district-tailored support.\n</div>"}}
