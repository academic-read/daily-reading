The results show that the predicted temperature accuracy is increased after the optimization of the long short-term memory network by the integrated algorithm, and the average relative error and average absolute error of the predicted load are reduced by 20.8% and 26.34kW respectively compared with the simulated load. After optimization, the ground source heat pump system can realize the staggered operation of the system through the joint prediction of the load of the hot water storage tank, and the intermittent start of the heat pump unit. The overall performance of the system is significantly improved. The energy consumption of the heat pump and the system is reduced to 181.97kWh and 446.61kWh respectively, and the COP is increased to 4.89 and 3.88 respectively. The decline trend of soil temperature is alleviated, the running time of peak and flat electricity price stages is reduced, the total power consumption is reduced by 1181.54kWh, and the operating cost is reduced by 1155.93CNY. The research results can provide theoretical basis and reference for the optimal design, intelligent operation control and building energy."}}

Using daily data from 2012 to 2025 and applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Error Correction Model (ECM) methodologies, we investigate how the unprecedented price shocks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine affected Italian households’ consumption patterns. Our analysis demonstrates that the crisis triggered a persistent transformation in consumers’ behavior that extends beyond the immediate crisis period. Before December 2021, natural gas demand was essentially price-inelastic. However, the energy crisis altered this relationship, with price elasticity increasing from virtually zero to 0.24 by 2023 — a transformation that persists even as prices have moderated. The elasticity is even larger (up to 1.69) when we refer to the price-responsive component of demand. Moreover, the decomposition of total demand into heating and baseload components reveals that space heating demand served as the primary adjustment mechanism during the crisis. Finally, we estimate approximately 11 billion cubic meters in savings between 2022 and 2024, translating to 10 billion euros in financial benefits."}}

In light of Taiwan’s net-zero commitments and the growing demand for electricity, energy policy must navigate the tension between maintaining power stability and advancing a low-carbon transition. This study employs the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to estimate the public’s willingness to pay (WTP) for the negative externalities associated with nuclear power and solar photovoltaics in Taiwan. A nationwide survey yielded 1,231 valid responses, and WTP was estimated using Probit and Logit models. The results reveal a higher sensitivity and WTP regarding the environmental and agricultural impacts of solar energy. The estimated WTP per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for solar energy ranges from NT$9.177 to NT$10.788, resulting in an annual public cost between NT$437.91 billion and NT$514.78 billion. In comparison, the WTP for nuclear power ranges from NT$3.743 to NT$3.83 per kWh, with a corresponding annual national cost between NT$178.63 billion and NT$182.92 billion. These findings suggest a shift in public concern from nuclear safety toward environmental sustainability with notable differences observed across demographic groups. Policy recommendations include enhancing transparency and improving risk communication to strengthen public understanding of energy-related externalities and support informed energy transition strategies."}}

Are there circumstances in which a fixed exchange rate could be beneficial? We study these perennial questions from the perspective of economies that have different exposures to commodity trade. We develop a flexible but tractable model for an economy that imports and/or exports commodities; moreover, in line with empirical evidence, we allow international borrowing conditions to vary endogenously with the commodity cycle, which gives rise to additional costs and benefits of active exchange rate management. By varying the economy’s commodity exposure along these dimensions, we analyze the implied volatility of inflation and activity under different policy rules, and derive the optimal policy. We find that the desirability of different policy configurations critically depends on the economy’s specific commodity exposure. Nonetheless, some form of inflation targeting tends to perform well in a relatively wide range of macroeconomic environments."}}

A dynamic game model is developed to analyze the strategic interactions among polluting firms that engage in CSR, and to compare the open-loop Nash equilibrium (commitment case) with the Markov perfect Nash equilibrium (no-commitment case). The analysis shows that as firms become more aware of CSR, their production strategies move closer to the socially optimal level, thereby enhancing social welfare. The study explores two distinct scenarios: excessive pollution and underproduction. Notably, even a modest degree of CSR can effectively mitigate excessive pollution. Moreover, in the no-commitment case, there are situations in which increasing the level of CSR can shift a firm’s behavior from underproduction to overproduction. This finding suggests that the socially optimal outcome in an oligopolistic market can be achieved even when firms are only partially concerned with CSR."}}

By combining a recent database of strategic rivalries with information on defense alliances, military conflicts, and bilateral trade for the years 1950-2019, we show that deteriorating relations impact trade independently of the destructive effects of wars. We find that strategic rivalries, where perceive one another as military threats, can significantly suppress trade, especially when the underlying conflicts involve ideological disputes or stem from multiple distinct sources of tension. The effect of rivalries on trade varies significantly over time, with the largest negative effects realized during the Cold War era. Over the entire sample period, accounting for strategic rivalries reduces the estimated impact of wars on trade by nearly 35 percent, suggesting that a significant portion of the trade disruption attributed to wars may actually result from rivalries."}}

We find that higher ESG ratings significantly reduce firms’ oil price risk exposure, with stronger effects for non-key polluters and derivative users. Mechanism analysis identifies three channels: outward foreign direct investment, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced transparency. Lower exposure to oil price risk translates into reduced bankruptcy probability, underscoring ESG’s role in corporate financial stability."}}

Static and dynamic econometric modelling (Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, method of moments quantile regression, two-step system GMM estimator) are employed on a global sample of 39 countries for the period 2010-2022. Findings confirm the negative relationship between fossil fuel consumption subsidies and female labor force participation rates. The investigation contributes to informed energy economics and policy with a focus on gender trajectories. It sheds light on the social implications of fossil fuel consumption subsidies, suggesting reforms that promote gender inclusion along with environmental and economic goals."}}

By modeling the cost-minimizing behavior of a hypothetical ship operator faced with compliance obligations, we derive the marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve implied by the current regulatory framework. Our analysis reveals that the FEUM&apos;s multi-tiered penalty structure, comprising the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), a GHG intensity penalty, and a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) blending sub-target, introduces discontinuities and non-monotonicity in the MAC curve. These distortions undermine economic efficiency by generating inconsistent incentives for emissions abatement. We propose a revised penalty function that replaces the original formulation with a linear structure, thereby restoring monotonicity in the MAC without altering overall compliance stringency. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed revision significantly reduces cost irregularities, particularly from 2035 onward when regulatory stringency increases.

To sharpen identification, we utilize review meeting records to exclude rejections citing concerns about revenue growth or profitability risks, as these may entail unobserved factors that also influence a firm&apos;s future export performance. Our difference-in-differences analysis reveals that IPO approval leads to a significant annualized increase of more than 6% in firm exports. IPO approval primarily affects the extensive margin, enabling firms to expand into more destination-product markets. Further evidence suggests that IPOs enhance exports by financing export-related intangible investments and risk-taking activities."}}

Firms are unable to freely adjust wages during economic contractions, generating an asymmetric distribution of unemployment over the business cycle. The model is calibrated to the dynamics of unemployment and net migration in a typical euro area country. An increase in labor mobility to that observed in the United States and holding all other parameters fixed would reduce the volatility of euro area unemployment by 40% and return 1 million unemployed to the workforce.

Emotional indices—Brand Sentiment Index for companies, Influence Index for influencers, Sentiment Index for politicians and public figures, Social Impact Index for organizations, Resilience Index for the WFP—are calculated using E$ = Σ (S × W), where S aggregates emotional scores from biometric, social, or programmatic data, and W incorporates ethical and cultural weights via AI-driven algorithms. Entities are quoted based on these indices, and E$ tokens enable transactions for personalized experiences, marketing campaigns, political funding, social initiatives, advocacy programs, and humanitarian efforts. Addressing the genericity, repetition, and theoretical limitations of Author (2025), this study provides detailed technical specifications (Polygon 2.0 blockchain, federated learning, zero-knowledge proofs) and robust ethical safeguards, including an enhanced Emotional Equity Index (EEI), smart contract governance, and GDPR-inspired regulations to mitigate commodification (Sandel, 2012), surveillance (Zuboff, 2019), cultural bias, and digital inequities. Illustrative scenarios demonstrate impact: a retailer generates €6 million in sales, an influencer monetizes exclusive content, a public figure funds advocacy campaigns, an NGO supports community projects, and the WFP funds 1.5 million school meals in South Sudan. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), the marketplace fosters ethical business innovation. Pilot studies, including a WFP collaboration, are proposed to validate the framework. This study contributes to business ethics by offering a scalable, equitable model for an emotional economy, urging global policymakers to regulate emotional data.\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n <span>Note: The reference to the Journal of Business Ethics concerns a manuscript that was submitted to the journal but was not accepted for publication.</span>\n</div>"}}

Approaching the city through a political-economic lens, the study views land not merely as a commodity but as a deeply contested socio-political terrain shaped by informality, speculative interests, and hybrid forms of governance. What distinguishes this study is its integrated perspective on land management, peri-urban transformation, and environmental risk, treating them as interwoven dynamics rather than isolated challenges. Siliguri’s strategic role as a corridor city linking the Indian plains with the eastern Himalayas renders it an important site for examining complex patterns of spatial accumulation and uneven development. Informal urban expansion, particularly on former tea estates, coupled with land brokerage networks and the complicity of state actors, has transformed the urban periphery into a fragmented and loosely regulated frontier. The work also highlights how informality operates not just as a survival mechanism but as a deliberate governance strategy that shapes access to infrastructure and perpetuates spatial inequalities across the city. The profile calls for a more inclusive, environmentally conscious, and regionally coordinated governance model to ensure a sustainable urban future."}}

This systematic literature review examines 25 years of academic publications -from 2000 to 2025- to clarify meanings, dimensions, and assessment methods of the value of TU in vacant real estate. Drawing on value theory, the study identifies three core dimensions: intrinsic value (worth and meaning), extrinsic value (measurable benefits and impacts), and systemic value (cultural and ethical perspectives). The analysis reveals that while TUs generate multi-dimensional values, as economic, social, cultural, and environmental, most scholarly attention has focused on economic and social value, with environmental value still underrepresented. Use value emerges as a central concept especially in grassroots and community-led initiatives, discussed in contrast with market-driven exchange value. Most of assessment methods range from qualitative case study analysis to comparative qualitative analysis, but Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) offer frameworks to evaluate multiple dimensions of both tangible and intangible benefits and impacts. The review evidences the difficulties of capturing values through singular metrics and demonstrate that systemic cultural value in stakeholder dynamics significantly influence how extrinsic added value is created and sustained. These findings advocates for a value-focused approach in real estate reuse and planning to guide equitable and sustainable value distribution for stakeholders, real estate and urban contexts."}}

Existing explanations attribute local search to either cognitive (e.g., absorptive capacity) or social constraints (e.g., conflicts) that prevent agents from pursuing distant alternatives. However, recent experimental studies find that individuals may still engage in local search even without such constraints. Here, we introduce \"learning through generalization\" as a mechanism that can produce local search behaviors independently. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that locality in search behaviors can endogenously emerge through generalization, especially when generalization breadth-i.e., the extent to which agents generalize experience from one alternative to others-is neither too narrow nor too broad. Ironically, our result shows that the intermediate generalization breadth, while producing local search, can actually help agents reach the global peak. Our model contributes to a nuanced view of local search and highlights the intertwined relationship between learning and search in adaptation."}}

Traditional embedding-based methods rely solely on the graph structural information, making limited use of textual semantics. Although emerging text-based methods, i.e., utilizing large language models (LLMs) to learn semantic information, can solve the aforementioned problems to some extent. They still face limitations: 1) Due to the extensive scale of knowledge graphs, prompt information is often lengthy, making it difficult for LLMs to focus on key information when processing long texts; 2) When dealing with semantically similar entities, LLMs often struggle to capture subtle differences between them, leading to insufficient discriminative capability and resulting in confusion. To address these challenges, we propose a reasoning-enhanced and interaction-corrective framework based on large language models for knowledge graph completion (ReaCo-KGC). First, a two-stage prompting mechanism is designed to enable LLMs to extract key information and reasoning processes from in-context information, i.e., adjacent triples, helping LLMs focus on the core content. In addition, a multi-agent re-ranking component that applies a turn-taking summarization strategy is proposed to refine the results and resolve confusion caused by semantic similarity. Moreover, we reduce the candidate set size effectively by using a lightweight model to eliminate irrelevant entities. Experiments on benchmark datasets FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework, validating its effectiveness."}}

Most citizens already own smartphones or computing devices. They should be able to use them like pen and paperindependently and securely. The lack of access to simple application functionality becomes a form of digital exclusion. This is a digital necessity for every citizen. CRUD is the new literacy. CitizenssApp exists to democratize software creation by removing cost, complexity, and dependency. Philosophical Foundation In the analog world, every citizen could record business, personal, or transactional information using pen and paper. In the digital world, that same simplicity should exist.

Firstly, a novel one-dimensional Sinusoidal Dynamic Delayed Feedback Logistic chaotic system (1D-SDFL) is introduced, which provides a secure key stream for the images. Experimental results demonstrate that the system possesses a wider chaotic parameter range and superior chaotic properties. During encryption, a self-similar Fractal Stair Scrambling Matrix (FSSM) is constructed to enhance spatial scrambling. Specifically, multiple images are sparsely represented using the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and scrambled through index sorting. Then, different measurement matrices generated via dynamic sampling of the 1D-SDFL system are used to compress the scrambled matrices. Subsequently, the compressed images undergo synchronized scrambling and diffusion using the FSSM. Finally, a Global Multi-image Equal-value Insertion (GMEI) disruption is performed to produce the final encrypted image. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of NPCR (99.6096%), UACI (33.4585%), and PSNR (31.9636 dB, CR = 0.25), and demonstrates high security and excellent reconstruction quality."}}

It argues that the prevailing Western approach-centered on sanctions, military deterrence, and diplomatic isolation-has failed to produce a durable resolution. Instead, it has entrenched authoritarian resilience and reinforced adversarial narratives. Drawing on behavioral political theory, the article introduces the concept of Authoritarian Loss Aversion, which posits that autocratic regimes resist compromise due to existential fears of regime collapse and loss of legitimacy. This psychological and institutional dynamic renders traditional coercive strategies counterproductive. In response, the article presents the Integration Paradigm: a strategic framework that replaces confrontation with structured inclusion. It rests on three interdependent pillars-Ukraine's permanent neutrality, phased territorial restoration, and conditional integration of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus into the European Economic Area (EEA). This model reframes compromise as transformation, offering authoritarian regimes a face-saving exit from conflict while embedding them in legal and economic systems that incentivize reform. The article outlines policy recommendations for EU and international actors, including multilateral treaty design, transitional governance mechanisms, and generational engagement strategies. It also engages with ethical foundations rooted in Kantian cosmopolitanism and Just Peace Theory, emphasizing reconciliation, dignity, and shared prosperity. Ultimately, the Integration Paradigm offers a blueprint for durable peace-one that transforms adversaries into partners through strategic inclusion rather than punitive isolation."}}

While public blockchain platforms offer decentralized and immutable ledgers that enhance transparency and auditability, their intrinsic openness often conflicts with enterprise demands for confidentiality and fine-grained access control. To address this tension, we introduce MAZE-Guard, a cryptographic framework that seamlessly integrates Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE) with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable scalable, privacy-preserving data sharing in decentralized environments. Distinct from prior work that primarily leverages ZKPs for access verification, MAZE-Guard emphasizes the anonymization of user authority interactions during the attribute key issuance phase—effectively mitigating metadata leakage and preventing attribute inference. Sensitive messages are fragmented and encrypted under expressive, multi-authority attribute policies, allowing only qualified participants to access protected content. Crucially, user eligibility is validated using Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs), ensuring cryptographic compliance with access policies without disclosing attribute values or user identities. A proof-of-concept implementation on Ethereum compatible platforms demonstrates that MAZE-Guard incurs only 101,000 gas for its sole on-chain verification step, achieves sub-125 ms latency across core cryptographic operations, and scales efficiently with increasing attribute complexity. These results underscore MAZE-Guard’s practicality as a robust and verifiable framework for secure, fine-grained collaboration in decentralized multi-party systems."}}

This makes reliable Quality of Service (QoS) prediction essential for selecting optimal services. However, real-world QoS data often suffer from high sparsity, and privacy concerns frequently prevent users from sharing their raw QoS records. This creates a dual challenge: achieving high prediction accuracy while preserving data privacy in sparse environments. To address these challenges, we propose DPIS-GNN, a novel framework that integrates ε-Differential Privacy (ε-DP) with subgraph-inductive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach first applies ε-DP mechanisms to obfuscate local datasets, protecting sensitive user information. These perturbed datasets are then aggregated into a unified interaction graph, from which relevant patterns are inferred. Next, we introduce a subgraph-based GNN that inductively learns from the noisy and sparse data to produce accurate QoS predictions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DPIS-GNN achieves up to a 17.55% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and a 9.77% decrease in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our model exhibits superior robustness in sparse and cold-start scenarios, offering both strong privacy protection and high predictive performance."}}

However, in practical applications, the training data across different user terminals are often non-iid. When the data distribution among user terminals is very different, the performance of the model will be greatly reduced if the knowledge learned from other user terminals is directly obtained. Furthermore, federated learning does not offer robust privacy protection, posing a privacy leakage risk during parameter uploading. To address these issues, we propose FedCKD, a trusted personalized federated learning method based on clustering and knowledge distillation. Considering the negative impact of mitigating the non-iid data, a personalized model is obtained for each client through clustering and knowledge distillation. Firstly, a K-means clustering algorithm based on Canopy is used. Then, it uses cyclic knowledge distillation to extract common knowledge, and performes re-learning to achieve personalization. Our approach also implements privacy protection using a distributed differential privacy mechanism based on a shuffling algorithm. Extensive experiments show that FedCKD performs significantly better than state-of-the-art baselines. Code for the experiments in this work can be found at https://github.com/LIUrxxxx/FedCKD."}}

Modelers often base these profiles on a single year of data. Because weather impacts generation performance and electricity demand, it is important to ensure CEMs use same-year load and renewable energy production profiles. However, the user is often left to decide which base year to use. Because different years have different load and renewable energy shapes, future projections based on any particular year might yield different optimal futures. The purpose of this study is to test that assumption and assess the impact of the baseline weather year selection on investment decisions made by CEMs for future generation development. We ran twenty CEM simulations of ERCOT from 2022-2050, each with a distinct base weather year from 2002-2021. We find negligible variation with weather year for the bulk grid-wide capacity and energy results, but found that variations in regional capacity, total costs, and emissions were more significant. While these deviations might be tolerable for many projects, we conclude that utilizing multiple weather years will improve model accuracy. Our results indicate that the share of electricity generated by variable sources is consistent across weather years, although the specific mix exhibits noticeable variation. We discover that the precision of simulations with multiple temporal stages can be improved without additional computational cost by utilizing data from a separate weather year during each model period."}}

Our analysis reveals that both age diversity and a strong alignment between age and rank independently harm ESG performance.

The main argument raised by the chapter is that immersive technology, including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Building Information Modelling (BIM), can play a transformative role in promoting sustainability and effective environmental management practices within the construction sector. The chapter aims to critically analyse how immersive technology can address global environmental challenges and contribute to sustainable building practices throughout the construction lifecycle. The research employs a quantitative research methodology involving an examination of existing construction practices globally. The research findings suggest that when appropriately integrated, immersive technology can facilitate virtual design and visualisation processes, conduct energy simulations and analyses for optimised energy efficiency, support sustainable material selection and life cycle assessments, and promote efficient construction waste management. Consequently, these applications significantly reduce the environmental impacts of construction projects. The study underscores the critical importance of widespread adoption and utilisation of immersive technology to foster sustainable construction practices globally, highlighting its potential to mitigate environmental degradation and promote environmentally conscious decision-making throughout the construction industry. Future research could focus on developing advanced algorithms and tools within immersive technology platforms to optimise sustainable design parameters. This could involve incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to automate the process of energy simulations, material selection, and life cycle assessments, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of sustainable design optimisation.</span>\n</div>"}}

The OCL is one of the most vulnerable components of the train traction power system as it is subjected to multiple impacts from the pantographs and to unpredictable environmental conditions. Wear, mounting imperfections, contact incidents, weather conditions and inadequate maintenance leads to increased degradation of the pantograph-OCL current collection performance, causing degradation on contacting elements and assets failure. Incidents involving the pantograph-OCL system are significant sources of traffic disruption and train delays. E.g., Network Rail statistics show that, on average, delays due to OCL failures are 2500 hours per year. In recent years, maintenance strategies have evolved significantly with improvements in technology and the increased interest of using real-time and historical data in decision support. This has led to an expansion in sensing systems for structures, vehicles and machinery. The railway industry is currently investing in Condition Monitoring (CM) technologies in order to achieve lower failure rates, and increased availability, reliability and safety of the railway service. This work presents a comprehensive review on the current CM systems for pantograph-OCL, including their advantages and disadvantages, and outlines future trends in this area."}}

This study presents enhancements to the SMARTEN v2.0 framework, a cutting edge time series forecasting algorithm designed to predict energy consumption and production with high precision. A key innovation is its scaling technique, which adjusts for seasonal and daily fluctuations, improving reliability in dynamic environments. SMARTEN v2.0 was tested using high-resolution datasets from two distinct locations: the Mafate microgrid in a tropical climate with minimal seasonal variation, and the GreEn-ER building in a semi continental mountainous region. These contrasting sites provided a robust basis for evaluating the model’s adaptability across diverse energy profiles. Performance metrics including RMSE, R², and MAE demonstrate SMARTEN v2.0’s strong ability to replicate energy trends, particularly under stable conditions. In both annual and monthly simulations, the model closely matches measured values, confirming its effectiveness in capturing long-term energy dynamics. Importantly, the normalized RMSE (nRMSE) remains below 20%, aligning with benchmarks found in scientific literature for similar forecasting studies. This supports the model’s credibility and places its predictive accuracy within accepted standards. However, the model faces challenges when forecasting irregular consumption patterns, such as those occurring during weekends and public holidays. These anomalies highlight the need for further refinements to improve accuracy in scenarios with non-standard behavior. Despite these limitations, SMARTEN v2.0 performs reliably in contexts involving photovoltaic production and consistent energy use."}}

The findings suggest statistically significant but diverse convergence tendencies, with better synchronization in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya, while Egypt and Mauritania continue to diverge. Notably, the analysis finds strong bidirectional causality between inflation, exchange rates, and economic growth, underscoring inflation's critical role in regional macroeconomic interactions. Conversely, the weak causal relationship between exchange rates and growth highlights structural impediments to effective monetary transmission. These findings have significant implications for policy coordination, inflation targeting, and regional monetary integration, particularly in the context of a possible North African monetary union.

This paper introduces the Capital Efficiency Switch (CES), a comprehensive legal-financial engineering framework designed to enable internal liquidity optimization across diverse jurisdictions without breaching existing tax, FX, or regulatory boundaries. By strategically utilizing synthetic financial positions, intelligent legal entity structuring, internal hedging mechanisms, and matched domestic funding arrangements, CES creates economic equivalence to capital movement without initiating physical crossborder transfer events. The framework's practical applicability and tangible benefits are illustrated through successful implementations within Fortune 500 corporations and global financial institutions. This framework has enabled global firms to unlock over $1 billion in idle liquidity and reduce FX and tax costs by up to 40% in some jurisdictions."}}

We do this by analyzing the performance of de-SPAC transactions that solicited private investment. These private investments in public equity are known as PIPEs. Because PIPE returns are publicly available, we are empirically able to determine whether the limited PIPE investors are getting a fair deal in these investments. We find that de-SPAC investors lose about forty-five percent of their investment within two years of the de-SPAC transactions. Furthermore, we find that almost all these losses are limited to those cases when the SPAC sponsors resort to PIPE financing, losing about fifty-five percent of their value abnormally. Hence, our evidence suggests that limited private-fund investors suffer substantial and systematic losses when they make PIPE investments in de-SPAC transactions. Our evidence at least partially justifies the SEC's new rules regarding the regulation of the private funds industry. Moreover, the need to address this matter has become more urgent in light of the August 7, 2025 Executive Order further opening pension funds' access to private equity markets, thus also exposing the retirement investments of retail investors to these risks."}}

Deviations in operational timing or sequence can signal errors, operator fatigue, or inefficient workflows. This paper presents a non-invasive, intelligent monitoring system for detecting both timing and sequence anomalies in a repetitive manual assembly task using synchronized multi-modal sensors, spatio-temporal deep learning for state estimation, and advanced temporal modeling. The system integrates millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar (TI IWR6843ISK) for capturing hand motion, Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors (VL53L0X-V2) for automated ground-truth labeling of box interactions, and optional video for debugging. A robust data collection pipeline, featuring detailed mmWave packet parsing, ensures frame-level synchronization across sensors via a centralized Frame ID generator. Raw sensor data is processed, and a CNN-GRU model is trained to estimate the current hand-box interaction state from spatio-temporal mmWave features. Subsequently, a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) network is developed for state sequence anomaly detection, and a statistical Z-score approach is employed for state duration anomaly detection. We demonstrate the system&apos;s ability to learn normal operational patterns from baseline data and effectively detect deliberately introduced timing and sequence anomalies. Our results highlight the potential of this combined approach—synchronized multi-modal sensing, CNN-GRU state estimation, TFTs for sequence analysis, and statistical methods for timing—for robust, real-time monitoring of manual industrial processes."}}

However, the scarcity of modeling data caused by physical equipment limitations and high measurement costs severely restricts the modeling performance. To address above challenge, this paper proposes a reverse virtual sample generation (VSG) method named output-reconstructed global-local conditional generative adversarial network (ORGL-CGAN). Specifically, a decomposition-reconstruction framework is employed in ORGL-CGAN, which decomposes target output data into high-frequency and low-frequency components. During reconstruction, white noise is added to the high-frequency components to enhance sample diversity, while the low-frequency components are preserved to maintain the primary data characteristics. Furthermore, the ORGL-CGAN framework integrates a gating mechanism to fuse global features extracted via multi-head attention mechanism with local features derived from convolutional operations. This design endows the model to simultaneously handle global information processing and local detail description, thereby improving the quality of generated virtual samples. A three-dimensional numerical case and an industrial debutanizer column case are employed to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that ORGL-CGAN can generate high-quality virtual samples with strong distributional alignment to original data, which are beneficial for enhancing the soft sensing model performance."}}

The empirical results reveal that bribery facilitates the introduction of new product innovations, with informal competition moderating negatively this relationship. Although financial accessibility stimulates directly firm innovation, it does not weaken the association between bribery and new product introductions.

The main idea is to deliver support effectively, donors should cover the needs of businesses and host regions, considering non-emergency and emergency times. Displaced business needs are logistics, mental health support, equipment displacement, support of displaced business employees, supply chain restoration, innovative development, new equipment, access to the new markets, contribution to the host community, and network. Information support infrastructure, physical infrastructure, innovative development, investment attractiveness, smart specialization industry companies’ support, supporting people (job market and new skills), and strengthening community measures are the primary needs of host regions.

This study was done to check how well natural materials like Moringa seeds, banana peels, and Aloe vera can clean dirty water. Two types of water were tested: one from the Beas River and the other from drainage water. Before treatment, both water samples had high turbidity (cloudiness), low pH (acidic), and in the case of drainage water, a high amount of dissolved solids (TDS). After treating the water with natural coagulants, Moringa seeds worked the best, reducing turbidity to very low levels and also improving pH and TDS. Banana peel and Aloe vera also helped, but not as much as Moringa. The colour and smell of the water improved after treatment. Microbial tests also showed fewer bacteria in the treated water, especially in the samples treated with Moringa. This study proves that natural coagulants are eco-friendly, low-cost, and effective alternatives to chemicals for water purification."}}

We use a comprehensive event study methodology to test the proposed hypotheses. We draw on Capital IQ's Key Development database, which provides operational closure events. Further, we merge the operations closures events with the Compustat data to obtain a sample of 1,501 US manufacturing firms with 10,883 events between 2002 and 2019. Though implied volatility is not significantly related to market performance, the relationship of implied volatility with a firm's market performance is strengthened by positive sentiment and TFP. The findings have implications for operations managers aiming to manage revealed uncertainty. This paper is the first attempt at empirically evaluating uncertainty management strategies under uncertainty conditions characterized by an environment of high implied volatility. The suspension of primary corporate operations reflects disruptions that must be carefully managed to improve business performance."}}

In this paper, a novel real-time red-light violation detection framework, termed DEYO-RL, is proposed. This framework integrates vehicle detection and tracking based on deep learning methodologies with intelligent trajectory analysis. A hybrid detection architecture is utilized, combining YOLO’s computational efficiency with DETR’s transformer-based contextual understanding, which ensures high accuracy and robustness across diverse urban scenarios. Additionally, a Contrastive Denoising Module (CDM) is introduced to enhance detection stability. At the same time, a TinyDet module, featuring sparsely-connected convolution (SCConv), is employed to improve the recognition of small-sized vehicles. The tracking pipeline is developed using an enhanced ByteTrack algorithm, effectively reducing identity switches and track fragmentation in multi-object tracking scenarios. Moreover, a trajectory-based analysis module is incorporated to accurately differentiate illegal red-light violations from legitimate right-turn maneuvers, thereby significantly minimizing false positive detections. Experimental evaluations conducted on the UA-DETRAC and Vietnamese Vehicles datasets illustrate that DEYO-RL surpasses state-of-the-art models in both detection and tracking performance metrics while maintaining real-time operational capability. Therefore, the proposed framework presents a viable AI-driven solution for enhancing intelligent traffic enforcement and urban safety."}}

Moreover, the two biases interplay: compared to long links, short links are more likely to be added when underage cues appear, and less likely to be removed under overage cues."}}

Through empirical analysis of four federal court decisions unanimously striking down executive orders, documentation of nearly $1 billion in coercive settlements, and real-time analysis of professional chilling effects, this study establishes that systematic law firm targeting violates First Amendment speech and association rights, Due Process protections, and separation of powers principles. The research contributes to constitutional coercion scholarship by extending doctrinal analysis to private professional entities while providing empirical measurement of constitutional harm through judicial unanimity and professional behavior changes. Findings suggest that legal profession independence requires heightened constitutional protection as a structural democratic safeguard rather than merely individual professional rights."}}

Fundamentally, ILC works by filtering both repetitive and non-repetitive errors over multiple repetitive control tasks, and iteratively compensating for the repetitive errors to achieve extremely high control precision. In engineering applications, the low-frequency components of errors are typically considered repetitive, while the high-frequency components are regarded as random and non-repetitive. Based on this, ILC often utilizes low-pass filters to filter out repetitive errors. However, the causes of multi-axis contour errors are far more complex than those of single-axis tracking errors. We believe that directly using frequency characteristics to distinguish whether contour errors are repetitive is insufficiently accurate, despite the extensive use of this approach in prior studies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel ILC method for contour error control based on the selection of repetitive errors. The method determines whether the errors in corresponding frequency bands exhibit repetitive characteristics based on the spectral features of the contour errors, thus enabling more precise filtering of repetitive errors. This approach effectively avoids the issues of convergence speed and precision degradation caused by the introduction of non-repetitive components during the iteration process in traditional ILC. Furthermore, we conducted a series of validation experiments on a multi-axis motion platform, which fully demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods under various experimental conditions, effectively addressing the shortcomings of ILC in error filtering."}}

Despite strong evidence and national support, uptake remains limited, with little known about therapists delivering iCBT or factors influencing engagement.ObjectiveUsing an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study aimed to provide a national overview of therapists delivering iCBT, their work environment, and acceptance, as well as explore group differences between clinics established through different implementation approaches.MethodsThe study identified all therapists using iCBT in routine care. Using a cross-sectional survey, data regarding therapists’ characteristics, their context, and TAM constructs was collected. Therapists were grouped by whether their clinics used bottom-up or top-down implementation approaches and compared on all TAM constructs.ResultsSixty-seven therapists were identified as actively delivering iCBT nationally. Of these, 45 therapists from 18 clinics responded (67% response rate). Therapists were experienced clinicians with varying backgrounds and work environments. High acceptance was found across all TAM dimensions except for Image. Therapists in clinics with structured top-down implementation and ongoing supervision reported highest acceptance.ConclusionDespite high therapist acceptance of iCBT, experienced loss in professional regard presents a cultural barrier hindering widespread adoption. Despite a decade of use, iCBT remains a small part of routine care. However, successful implementation across diverse therapist backgrounds is achievable, and mandated top-down implementation appears useful when supported by experienced supervision."}}

By predicting the furnace lining temperature, unreasonable operations can be identified, and the thermal state of the blast furnace can be better controlled. However, due to the varying reaction time and the spatial distribution of the blast furnace ironmaking process, the influence of process parameters on the lining temperature exhibits dynamic time delay. To address this issue, a lining temperature prediction model incorporating dynamic feature extraction across numerous time series is presented, and an innovative attention mechanism is introduced to capture the dynamic features of time series. Finally, a convolutional neural network is employed to enhance the ability of the prediction model to perceive local temporal patterns. The originality lies in integrating gated recurrent units with attention mechanisms to address varying time delays among process variables, resulting in improved prediction accuracy compared to existing methods. Based on the actual production data, the feasibility and effectiveness of the model are demonstrated."}}

Hybrid frameworks combining complementary heuristics enhance global exploration but commonly rely on fixed switching rules, resulting in premature stagnation and prohibitive computational costs under complex landscape deformation. Although integrating human preferences can guide optimization, current implementations mostly utilize preferences for parameter tuning or weighting schemes rather than dynamic algorithm coordination. To address this limitation, we propose User Preference-Driven Hybrid Optimization with Dynamic Switching (UPHODS). UPHODS constructs a Gaussian-process surrogate that unifies designer-generated pairwise ranking feedback and objective metrics into a hybrid-utility surface. At each decision epoch, the framework dynamically selects the optimizer whose population maximizes expected hybrid utility. When projected gains surpass a hysteresis threshold, an elite subset preserving solution similarity warm-starts the selected algorithm. Experiments on high-dimensional benchmarks demonstrate a 10.66% average performance improvement over fixed-rule hybrids. In an industrial vehicle-body lightweighting scenario, UPHODS reduces design iterations by 18.5% and achieves 14.9% additional mass reduction, confirming the effectiveness of integrating user-defined preferences with utility-driven dynamic algorithm coordination in complex design tasks."}}

Through extensive long-term experimentation, this study reveals that thermal error models established from low-temperature ambient batches consistently demonstrate superior robust accuracy compared to those from high-temperature conditions. This paper systematically investigates the fundamental basis of thermal robustness models. Our findings indicate that temperature-sensitive points (TSPs) exhibit a significantly stronger correlation with thermal error under lower ambient temperatures, thereby preserving more comprehensive thermal deformation information essential for maintaining prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, contrary to conventional assumptions linking high correlation with pronounced multicollinearity, our comparative analysis of temperature-sensitive points (TSPs) between thermal groups revealed statistically indistinguishable multicollinearity levels. Accordingly, this study establishes a novel ambient temperature selection criterion for constructing thermally robust models, achieving a 50\\% improvement in thermal robust accuracy performance (annual average root mean squared error) compared to an inappropriate selection criterion for ambient temperature ranges."}}

Existing studies have recognized the combination of numerical and functional flexibility as an effective strategy. However, research on the joint application of this strategy is mostly confined to the theoretical level, and studies targeting practical application scenarios also primarily rely on static workforce assumptions (such as fixed skill sets and established personnel structures), and lacks dynamic mechanisms for managing multi-skilled internal employees and external temporary workers when coping with uncertainty. To address this gap, this study proposes a multi-objective robust optimization model, which primarily focuses on solving the proper decision-making problem of internal employee capability enhancement and external temporary worker recruitment under the condition of dynamic changes of required skill levels. The model explicitly accounts for uncertainties in task demands. To effectively solve the resulting complex optimization problem, we develop a dual-level reinforcement learning-enhanced multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (RL-NSGA-II-ALNS). This approach adaptively adjusts evolutionary parameters of NSGA-II and controls the invocation of ALNS local search modules based on real-time learning feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional evolutionary algorithms in terms of convergence, solution diversity, and robustness. This study provides an intelligent and adaptive decision-making framework for workforce planning in uncertain and demand-driven manufacturing systems."}}

Study 1 shows that, in moral dilemmas, giving into temptation is a much more influential factor in moral judgement than experiencing temptation. Studies 2 and 3 show that, in non-moral dilemmas, agents who overcome temptation are rated better than untempted agents. This effect is unchanged regardless of whether agents are adults or children, but is diminished when untempted agents lack intentionality in choosing virtuous actions. Study 4 uses a within-subjects design to replicate the effect from Studies 2 and 3 and show that, in moral dilemmas, untempted agents are rated better than agents who overcome temptation. However, the effect in moral dilemmas is more robust than the effect in non-moral dilemmas.

These networks too, are a marvel. But they also carry a kind of poison with them.

While extremism in the U.S. military is not a new threat, the events of January 6, 2021, brought the threat into much sharper focus. It exposed three preexisting trends, each sitting in plain sight but not yet woven together. These trends include a growing acceptance of extremist views and ideologies in U.S. military and veteran communities, an increase in violent extremist acts committed by individuals with military backgrounds, and the enhanced use of digital platforms by extremist groups to target their messaging to and strengthen their recruitment of individuals with military experience. To return to the metaphor, the extremist poison is teeming through the pipes at an alarming rate, and the number of pipes has increased to include social media platforms, encrypted chat tools, gaming platforms, podcasts, and music streaming apps, including YouTube, Discord, Gab, Telegram, and WhatsApp, among many others. In offering these observations, the author is mindful of not overstating the threat and takes seriously warnings as to the adverse consequences that follow from hyperbole and exaggeration. Indeed, a fundamental difficulty is the lack of understanding as to scope and scale of the extremism threat in the U.S. military. This Article attempts to draw the contours of that threat, exposes the structural and legal obstacles that make countering extremism in the military such a fraught exercise, and identifies actors, tools, and mechanisms—beyond the conventional options––able to overcome these long-standing structural and institutional obstacles."}}

It explores how innovations such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), gamification, and Learning Management Systems (LMS) are transforming traditional teaching and learning models. Despite the growing adoption of these technologies, there remains a gap in research regarding their long-term effectiveness, the adaptability of educators, and the disparities in access across different educational settings. This study aims to address this gap by identifying the most influential technologies in education, assessing their impact on pedagogical strategies, and examining the challenges educators face in integrating these tools into their practice. Using a secondary research methodology, this study synthesizes existing literature, reports, and case studies to evaluate trends and challenges in educational technology adoption. Key findings indicate that while these technologies offer significant benefits, including personalized learning, increased student engagement, and improved accessibility, their implementation is often hindered by barriers such as resistance to change, infrastructure limitations, and digital equity concerns. The paper highlights the importance of aligning teaching methodologies with technological advancements to foster dynamic, student-centered learning environments. Understanding the intersection of these technologies with contemporary pedagogies is essential for educators, policymakers, and institutions to effectively navigate and adapt to the evolving educational landscape."}}

Resilience strategies integrating multi-level fortification, capacity backup, multi-sourcing, temporary outsourcing, and multiple transportation routes are used to mitigate disruption risks and ensure a stable supply of raw materials for enterprises. A new two-stage stochastic 4PL network design model for e-waste recycling is proposed, using a scenario-based approach to characterize disruption scenarios.

The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated using a real case study from a home appliance recycling company in northern Turkey, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on important parameters such as the minimum recycling rate to provide management insights for 4PLs."}}

However, OD matrix prediction faces several key challenges: (1) high-dimensional sparsity and imbalanced distribution of data, (2) monotonous feature representation, (3) exponential growth of computational complexity with matrix size, and (4) insufficient model interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel feature selection Mamba model based on multimodule architecture and state-space modeling (MF-Mamba). The model incorporates three key innovations: First, it implements a multi-module parallel architecture to process heterogeneous data including spatial geometric information and temporal numerical features, effectively mitigating the data sparsity issue. Second, it introduces an adaptive feature selection mechanism that learns the contribution weights of different features, simultaneously enhancing both prediction accuracy and model interpretability. Finally, it constructs a sequence modeling module based on the state-of-the-art Mamba state-space model to efficiently capture both long- and short-term temporal dependencies in OD matrices. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset from Shenzhen Metro demonstrate that MF-Mamba significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly achieving accurate predictions for high-traffic routes. This research provides reliable technical support and practical reference for intelligent operation management of urban rail transit systems."}}

This paper proposes a novel deep evidence mining framework to enhance the trustworthiness of open-set fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The framework integrates evidence theory with deep learning, enabling the model to extract and quantify evidence from input data. A multi-layer evidence mining paradigm is introduced to guide feature extraction towards evidence acquisition, improving the model&apos;s adaptability to complex architectures.

Many retail platforms passively allocate the prominent positions by selling them to sellers in exchange for advertising revenue (i.e., advertiser-driven model). Otherwise, a platform can actively select sellers at the prominent positions to maximize its profit from commission (i.e., platform-guided model). How does different ways of managing prominence affect the strategic interactions between sellers? When and why can the platform benefit more from advertiser-driven model than platform-guided one? We answer these questions with a game-theoretical model that features competing asymmetric sellers and consumer heterogeneity over brand preferences and search costs. We find that when the platform sells prominence, the strong (weak) seller is more likely to take the prominent position when search cost is high (low), both sellers' valuations towards the prominence may present a non-monotonic relationship with the search cost, and counterintuitively, the weak seller might even form a negative valuation towards prominence in some cases. In contrast, the platform is more likely to place the strong seller at the prominent position, regardless of the level of search cost, when selecting the prominent seller itself. Surprisingly, under certain scenarios, the platform-guided model, which sacrifices the platform's advertising revenue in exchange for a better control over sellers' pricing, can result in more intensified competition between sellers and therefore can be strictly dominated by the advertiser-driven model."}}

The central thesis posits that while the fundamental economic pattern of \"creative destruction\"-entailing short-term job displacement followed by long-term net job creation and productivity growth-remains a constant, the AI revolution presents a historically unique challenge due to its unprecedented velocity of diffusion and its capacity to automate non-routine cognitive tasks. The methodology involves a qualitative synthesis of economic history, labor market data, and institutional reports to identify recurring dynamics and critical distinctions across these eras. Key findings indicate a consistent pattern of task reallocation over job elimination, persistent skills gaps driving transitional inequality, and the critical role of policy and institutional adaptation in mitigating social costs. The paper concludes that the societal impact of AI is not technologically determined but will be shaped by strategic choices in education, corporate governance, and social policy. It identifies key limitations, including the predictive uncertainty of historical analogies, and proposes future research directions focused on the efficacy of retraining programs and the evolving nature of human-AI collaboration."}}

To shed light on this problem, we present findings across two research contexts that support a theory of diminished nudge effectiveness where AI use has been disclosed, and the reversal of this effect when the disclosure is paired with transparency about how the AI works, leading to an overall increase in nudge effectiveness. Modelling shows that AI Reputation is a primary factor in how AI Transparency is operationalized on trust and nudge effectiveness.

This paper presents a novel integrative approach that combines AI-driven forecasting with behavioral interventions to help businesses optimize energy consumption under critical peak pricing (CPP) schemes, reduce costs, and align with sustainability initiatives. In partnership with En-Pro, an energy consulting firm, we conducted a multi-phase longitudinal study with large organizational clients, leveraging neural network time series modeling to improve peak energy demand predictions and behaviorally informed communications leveraging planning prompts to enhance compliance with curtailment recommendations. The results demonstrate significant financial savings, improved operational efficiency, and reduced environmental impact, benefiting clients, regulators, service providers, and society. We contribute to previous research on resource management, systems thinking, and nudging in an organizational context by aligning technological tools with human processes. This work offers a practical, business-oriented solution to real-world challenges, creating value for multiple stakeholders and positioning firms for long-term success in an increasingly resourceconstrained world."}}

We study this question in the context of mobile apps, where price variations are common. Specifically, we examine how price promotions in Apple's App Store affect consumer evaluations measured by subsequent star ratings. Our results suggest that consumers tend to evaluate the product less favorably during price promotions than before the promotions. We provide evidence suggesting that reduced prices increase the likelihood of attracting consumers with lower valuations. Despite the reduced price, the app still represents a poor fit to these consumers' tastes. As a result of the mismatch between a consumer's taste and product characteristics, consumers who purchased during the promotion rate the app less favorably. These findings highlight a potential downside of aggressive price promotions for digital products, suggesting that firms must closely monitor online product evaluations to mitigate any negative impacts."}}

For supernet pruning, we present Train-Time Progressive Pruning (TPP), which integrates the traditional “pre-train → prune → fine-tune” cycle into a single training phase. TPP progressively reduces the supernet size during training, accelerating the process without compromising convergence speed. After each pruning step, we further refine the search space by eliminating weak candidates, effectively narrowing the search space and speeding up subsequent subnet selection. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that PS2NAS significantly reduces computational costs while achieving a favorable trade-off between model size and performance."}}

Despite growing investment in off-grid solar, biogas, and improved cookstoves, adoption rates remain uneven and slower than expected, particularly among rural and low-income households. This study examines how behavioral heuristics influence household decisions around renewable energy adoption in Rwanda and assesses the poverty-related impacts of such adoption. It also aims to provide policy-relevant insights for improving uptake. A mixed-methods approach was used, combining a structured survey of 500 households across rural and urban areas with focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) involving policymakers, energy providers, and community leaders. Behavioral factors, such as present bias, status quo bias, risk perception, mental accounting, and social influence, were assessed using survey indicators and thematic analysis. Logistic regression was applied to estimate predictors of adoption, while poverty outcomes were measured using income, time-use, and health-related data. Findings indicate that present bias and risk aversion significantly reduce the likelihood of adopting clean energy technologies, while social proof and awareness campaigns substantially improve uptake. Households that adopted clean energy reported a 20.1% increase in income, a 54.6% reduction in firewood collection time, and notable health improvements. However, mistrust in technology and poor-quality awareness efforts continue to hinder adoption, especially in rural areas and among women. The study recommends embedding behavioral interventions into Rwanda's energy access strategy, including targeted nudges, improved quality assurance, flexible financing mechanisms (e.g., PAYGO), and community-led awareness initiatives. Addressing behavioral barriers is critical to improving policy effectiveness and accelerating a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable energy transition."}}

For example, corporations can run to bankruptcy court to shed collective bargaining agreements and class action torts judgments such as sexual harassment and race discrimination suits. However, when unions and workers fight back, corporations respond by filing tort suits against unions for actions taken during an organizing campaign or a strike and chase them into bankruptcy. If unions were treated like corporations, then they would be able to discharge those tort claims. But that is not what is happening. Instead, corporations are asking courts to deny unions the same protection that they receive on the basis that unions are filing for bankruptcy protection in “bad faith.” When examined through a law and political economy lens, this tension concerning the applicability of discharge raises questions about whether bankruptcy’s promise of a “fresh start” exists only for “fake people” such as corporations but not for “real people” such as workers and their unions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n This Article examines bankruptcy law’s role in shaping collective power for labor unions and workers.

Second, if bankruptcy law provides no refuge for unions seeking relief from tort judgements arising out of their organizing and strike related activity, then it will further limit the economic weapons available to unions to inflict damage on their employers during economic strife.

We assemble a longitudinal panel of street view images from 2016 and 2023, apply a pre-trained Place Pulse deep-learning model to score six perceptual attributes (safety, beauty, liveliness, wealth, boredom and depression), and link the resulting measures to 1,543 housing transactions through hedonic price models that control for structural, locational and temporal factors.The analysis reveals two intertwined patterns. First, perceived safety, beauty and liveliness improved or held steady in the historic center but deteriorated across many peripheral streets, accentuating a long-standing core–periphery divide. Second, the housing market rewarded positive perceptual change in the center, yet showed little response where perceptions darkened, leaving vulnerable districts without either improved surroundings or compensating wealth effects.These findings demonstrate the value of integrating computer-vision perception metrics with property data to provide planners with a timely, low-cost diagnostic of neighborhood appeal. Targeting streets where perceptual decline is deepest and market signals are weakest could prevent demographic shrinkage from further entrenching spatial inequality."}}

Contrary to established literature, we find that patent output does not significantly contribute to either income or profit among the sampled firms. Further investigation reveals that patents may primarily serve a signaling function to external investors and policymakers, rather than reflecting true innovative productivity. In contrast, R&amp;D expenditure shows a consistent and positive association with firm performance. Through mechanism analysis, we explore three channels-organizational environment, employee quality, and policy-driven incentives-to explain the impact of R&amp;D, identifying capital inflow and valuation as key drivers of R&amp;D investment. Finally, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the effects of R&amp;D are more pronounced in sub-industries such as smart terminals and digital creativity, and for firms based in Shenzhen.

It enables construction across generations, jurisdictions, and institutions. Yet trust must continually be earned-especially in the public domain, where risk, uncertainty, and historical memory converge. The idea of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) emerged as an attempt to renew that trust: by blending the agility and innovation of private actors with the responsibility and scale of the state. The UK led the global charge through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), which later matured into PF2-a model that sought greater transparency, better risk allocation, and a deeper understanding of the public interest. And then, PF2 was shelved. But was it truly dead? This essay traces the philosophical and institutional arc of PPPs, with PF2 as its focal point. It revisits the early days of private finance in infrastructure-from Brunel to the great rail syndicates-and examines the wartime pivot that birthed the modern state-led model. It explores the revival of private finance in the neoliberal moment, the political theatrics that declared its demise, and the subtler rhythms of collaborative contracting that suggest its afterlife. Drawing on historical episodes, global institutions, and theoretical insights, the discussion argues that PPP is not a technique but a way of seeing-a means of negotiating complexity in the shared public realm. Shelving PF2 may have been politics; but partnership, in a complex world, remains perennial."}}

The effect operates through behavioral adaptation: reduced Dengue risk encourages households to shift from airconditioning to natural ventilation. Consistent with this mechanism, we further find larger electricity reductions during cooler periods and in blocks with better ventilation potential. By documenting the environmental co-benefits of public health interventions, our study links health policy, energy use, and climate resilience, showing that disease control can foster sustainability in tropical cities."}}

According to data from the World Bank, Rwanda has consistently increased public investment in education, leading to significant improvements in national literacy levels and school accessibility (World Bank, 2004). The expansion of inclusive education for historically marginalized groups has further reinforced social integration and contributed to the formation of a more unified national identity; these educational advances played a central role in facilitating Rwanda's post-conflict recovery (The Guardian, 2011). However, the recent escalation of tensions with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) introduces new geopolitical conflicts that threaten Rwanda's social gains achieved through these reforms (Lawal, 2024). As such, the sustainability of Rwanda's educational progress increasingly depends on the government's ability to manage emerging regional threats while maintaining internal stability."}}

We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in collaboration with a Dutch online energy-saving platform, where more than 7,000 homeowners were randomly assigned to one of five groups.

Theoretically, while shorter working hours may constrain the time available for innovative activities, it could also foster innovation by improving employees' work-life balance, thereby creating an environment that is favorable for innovation. For our empirical analysis we exploit the 2018 Korean Working Hours Reform-which capped weekly working hours at 52-as an exogenous shock to working hours. We find that the quantity of innovation either increased or remained stable, as indicated by the rise in patent applications and the steady number of granted patents following the reform. However, there is a significant increase in rejected patent applications, along with decreases in both patent citations and the number of patents ever cited, suggesting a decline in innovation quality. Moreover, this effect is more pronounced in firms that undertake significant R&amp;D investments. These results suggest that restrictive working-hours policies, while maintaining quantitative innovation output, may impede the development of more radical and groundbreaking innovations. Our findings broaden our understanding of how working hours, a key aspect of the work environment, influences innovation and offer important insights with organizational and regulatory implications."}}

This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of Mongolia's planned SSB tax by estimating its effect on health outcomes, healthcare costs, and changes in SSB consumption patterns. Using a Markov cohort model, we project outcomes over 10-year, 20-year and lifetime horizons. The model incorporates changes in obesity prevalence, noncommunicable disease (NCD) incidence, and associated costs, with primary outcomes measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. To improve precision, disease risk estimates are informed by biomarker data, such as blood sugar and lipid levels, minimising reliance on self-reported health indicators. The ad valorem tax of 20% is projected to reduce consumption of SSBs by 31%. Across the three time horizons, it could avert 13, 260 and 2,255 deaths; yield 2,899, 14,362 and 33,613 QALYs; and reduce healthcare cost by $1.98 million, $9.81 million and $22.95 million, respectively. Compared to no tax, the ad valorem tax is both cost-saving and more effective, making it a dominant strategy. These findings support the implementation of the SSB tax as it will reduce Mongolia's NCD burden and generate long-term fiscal and health benefits."}}

We find that social media sentiment significantly predicts crude oil market returns, with its predictive power stemming from both fundamental information and noise. Positive sentiment is primarily associated with fundamental information, leading to lasting price changes, whereas negative sentiment is largely noise-driven, resulting in temporary price changes that eventually revert. In addition, only positive sentiment predicts crude oil inventory changes, further emphasizing its link to fundamental information. Furthermore, we isolate social media insights from news media and find that social media provides unique, incremental information beyond traditional news outlets."}}

China’s decarbonisation goal reflects its ambition to develop internationally competitive clean energy industries and achieve green industrialisation. While China’s clean energy manufacturing capacity has rapidly surged in the past two decades, the progress in deploying clean energy resources to decarbonise the energy system has been less notable. Aligning the dual goals of decarbonisation and green industrialisation in China’s clean energy development remains challenging.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Given the vast divergence among Chinese provinces and cities, it is difficult, if not impossible, for the central government to prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach and uniformly implement it nationwide. Local authorities in China should retain the discretion in crafting policy measures to address climate change and facilitate low-carbon transition based on their respective circumstances. This chapter selects the Guangdong province as a case study and explores its regulatory and policy efforts in facilitating the clean energy transition to exemplify climate change governance at China’s local level. The significant role of Guangdong as China’s local-level policy laboratory on various fronts has been extended to the climate and energy areas, too. Guangdong’s recent experiments with novel market-oriented approaches in the energy sector, particularly the power market, to boost clean energy integration and advance decarbonisation are notable yet insufficiently discussed. This chapter aims to bridge this important gap by critically analysing Guangdong’s decarbonisation policy experiment as a significant component of the province’s climate change governance. The lessons from Guangdong’s experiences will offer useful insights for other localities inside and outside China.\n</div>"}}

A value-weighted spread portfolio, cANCHOR, which goes long on cryptocurrencies with high N earness 52 and short on those with low N earness 52 , generates an average return of around 130 basis points per week. Additional analyses help rule out competing explanations based on risk exposure or market frictions.

To strengthen causal identification, we exploit Sino-U.S. trade war as an exogenous shock, and our findings remain robust across a series of sensitivity tests. Mechanism analyses indicate that D&O insurance promotes such transactions through two channels: enhancing active risk-taking and improving investor protection. Further analysis shows that the effect of D&O insurance is amplified in settings with more pronounced institutional deficits, i.e. when acquirers operate in weaker domestic legal environments or targets are located in stronger legal jurisdictions. These results suggest that D&O insurance not only enhances firms&apos; overall capacity for active risk-taking, but also acts as a complement to inadequate domestic investor protection. Collectively, our findings highlight the important role of D&O insurance in helping emerging-market firms address institutional deficiencies in reverse cross-border M&As, providing evidence of how financial instruments can function as effective complements to legal infrastructure in weak institutional environments."}}

Using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) approach, this study examines both the long-term relationship and short-term dynamics between variables. The Johansen cointegration test indicates the presence of a significant cointegration vector, suggesting a long-term relationship among the four variables. The Granger causality test results show that inflation significantly causes changes in the BI Rate, while the exchange rate and IHSG exhibit a two-way causal relationship. The impulse response function (IRF) analysis reveals that inflation and the IHSG respond significantly to BI Rate shocks, while the exchange rate shows a very limited response. Variance decomposition shows that inflation contributes the most to BI Rate variation in the long term, up to 35%. These findings confirm that the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission is strongest through the inflation channel, while its impact on the IHSG and exchange rate is more limited. This study emphasizes the need to strengthen transmission channels and policy coordination to enhance national monetary effectiveness."}}

It argues that the AI-driven creative economy replicates colonial patterns of appropriation, transforming human expression into commodified outputs while marginalizing the creators whose work makes these systems possible. Through the figures of the fruit seller, the buyer and the artist, the article interrogates who is valued, who is erased and who reaps the rewards in this evolving landscape. The analysis turns next to the banana itself as an object of constructed value, exploring how copyright’s doctrines of authorship, originality and fair use struggle to accommodate the layered and distributed nature of AI-mediated creation. These doctrinal limitations, the article contends, leave creators vulnerable while enabling dominant platforms to entrench extractive practices under the guise of innovation. Finally, the article examines the ‘wall’, the metaphorical and institutional surfaces against which generative AI is made legible and legitimate. It begins by situating current AI governance within broader global trends of legal fragmentation and jurisdictional arbitrage, highlighting how regulatory divergence reflects deeper normative commitments—some prioritizing innovation, others dignity and distributive justice. It then critiques reactive proposals that rely on private licensing regimes or piecemeal litigation, arguing that such approaches risk entrenching opacity and extractive control. In their place, the article advocates for structural reforms grounded in transparency, attribution and participatory design, legal scaffolding that can recognize distributed authorship and protect against enclosure. Without these interventions, the generative AI economy may replicate the very conditions that Comedian satirizes: spectacle without substance, progress without equity."}}

We develop an equilibrium model of tariff administration with costly verification of declared values that explains these twin trends: Administrative capacity allows Customs officials to disaggregate goods and assess tailored specific tariffs, obviating misvaluation while minimizing price distortions. The model successfully predicts several additional empirical patterns: Specific tariffs tend to be assessed on goods that are homogeneous, cheap, or lightly taxed."}}

Studies indicated that adopting Hybrid Rice Technology (HRT) improved profitability, although it often involved higher investment costs. While research explored factors influencing HRT adoption and its yield benefits, a notable gap remained in understanding its economic impact. This highlighted the need for more comprehensive, region-specific studies to capture the nuanced economic implications of HRT adoption, addressing issues such as self-selection bias and potential endogeneity in seed choice. This study aimed to bridge knowledge gaps regarding the effectiveness of agricultural technologies, specifically HRT, by examining its impact on the income and yield of farmers in Camarines Sur, the rice granary of the Bicol region, Philippines. A total of 323 farmers were randomly selected and personally interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire. The farmers were classified into adopters and nonadopters. Propensity score matching (PSM) procedures were applied to address endogeneity and selection bias, as the study relied on cross-sectional data. A two-stage econometric model was used, with the first stage involving an adoption decision through the Probit model to determine the likelihood of HRT adoption. The second stage employed PSM to estimate the impact of HRT adoption. The findings revealed that hybrid rice technology positively influenced both yield and profitability. However, realizing these benefits fully depends on the quantity of labor, right application of inputs (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, etc.), and proper management practices, which are essential to maximizing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of hybrid rice cultivation."}}

It examines key economic concepts such as cost-effectiveness, value-based care, and return on investment, highlighting both direct costs related to implementation, training, and maintenance, and indirect benefits including error reduction, shortened hospital stays, and improved workforce productivity. The discussion addresses disparities in AI adoption between high-income and low- and middle-income countries, emphasizing infrastructural barriers, potential for leapfrogging technologies, and the necessity of international collaboration and standardization. Ethical, legal, and social implications are considered alongside technological limitations, data quality, interoperability, and bias mitigation.

This study delves into the prevalence of VREs, while examining the nurse's knowledge of VREs and their reporting attitudes, and practices. Study design: Cross sectional analytical study. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 129 nurses working in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a major tertiary care hospital located in the southern part of India. The study involved the administration of a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey questionnaire. Results: The findings demonstrate a deficiency in the comprehension of VREs among ICU nurses, which subsequently affects their attitudes and reporting practices. Only a small percentage of nurses possess good knowledge (13.2 %), attitude (7 %), and reporting practices (5.4 %). Many nurses identified issues with ventilator performance, including component failure (17 %), design issues (14 %), and alarm problems (14 %). They also reported battery-related problems (9 %), lack of awareness of the instruction manual (7 %), software challenges (6 %), and wear and tear (6 %). A significant association between VRE knowledge and staff experience (p &lt; 0.05) and attitude (P &lt; 0.001) was found. Reporting practices are influenced by staff attitudes (moderate, P &lt; 0.001; good, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study highlights the significant impact of VRE on patient safety, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive understanding and effective preventative measures in healthcare settings."}}

It also recognises the need to account for the different developmental states of nations to achieve a Just Transition. The paper reviews the role of patents in technology transfer and recognises that it is often not the patent, but rather the associated know-how and capacity that prove a hurdle to implementation of adaptation and mitigation technology in DCs and LDCs. It also reviews the general approaches to green taxation before focusing on the use of patent boxes.

Building on recent frameworks for knowledge creation and decision making under uncertainty, it distinguishes between specialists, who engage in costly \"on the spot\" reasoning to generate tacit knowledge around a focal point, and generalists, who search for and interpolate existing knowledge but deliver answers subject to error. The model characterises how these two types of workers should be allocated across a continuum of questions, given the location of codified knowledge points and the distribution of problems. It shows that optimal task assignment depends on the cognitive process through which information is processed rather than on skill endowments or task complexity. When specialists operate around both knowledge points, their allocation is shaped by their absolute advantage over generalists, leading to non-contiguous specialist domains interspersed with generalist regions. When specialists cluster around a single point, a natural boundary emerges between specialist and generalist domains that shifts but persists despite changes in question distribution. Extending the analysis to a two-period setting, the paper identifies when specialists should sacrifice static efficiency to codify their tacit discoveries, creating bridges that allow generalists to operate more effectively in the future. These results provide a formal microfoundation for Babbage's insights into the division of cognitive labour and offer predictions about how knowledge work responds to changes in the knowledge environment, the distribution of questions, and the patience of capital."}}

Using both standard asset pricing factors and a wide range of anomalies, we document that, while factors related to low leverage, low risk, profitability and quality tilt towards green firms, those related to value, size, accruals, seasonality, and short-term reversals invest disproportionately in brown stocks. The underlying firms also vary in their social, and governance scores. However, there is ample variation even within a given investment style so that an investor can reduce their exposure to firms with poor non-financial scores by picking the right characteristics to implement their chosen strategies. In addition, we build trimmed factors by gradually excluding firms with the worst scores from the investment universe, and show that investors can improve the non-financial performance of the majority of them substantially at little to no financial cost. A more engaged investor can also build factors within a subset of highly rated stocks, but at the risk of deviating more in terms of performance. Our findings have implications for the rapid development of smart-beta and other indexing strategies in the context of sustainable finance."}}

This study provides a novel insights to examine how multidimensional macro-level risks, including political, economic, social, and technological factors, influence trade transitions, and how these effects are conditioned by policy coordination and technological adaptation. Using panel data from 2002 to 2022 across China and 10 ASEAN countries, we used fixed-effects regressions and Cox proportional hazards analysis to assess both time-invariant and dynamic risk effects. The results showed that political, economic, and technological risks significantly accelerate the transition, supporting the “risk-induced institutional adaptation” mechanism. While social risks are not directly significant, their interaction with policy coordination has negative effects, indicating that high regulatory convergence may reduce reform pressure and weaken risk-induced transformation dynamics. Technological adaptation does not significantly moderate risk effects, suggesting that innovation capacity alone is insufficient without embedded institutional mechanisms. This study proposes an interdisciplinary framework integrating Political, Economic, Social, Technological (PEST) and survival modeling to assess the dynamics of Cleaner Production-Oriented Trade Transformation (CPOTT) as an indicator of sustainable trade resilience. The findings emphasize the importance of transforming external risks into drivers, fostering institutional alignment, and integrating innovation into governance to support a robust green trade system in the China–ASEAN region."}}

These profiles show strong internal structure and are significantly associated with life satisfaction, psychological well-being, and financial health. By capturing deeper drivers of financial behavior, our approach moves beyond conventional demographic or transaction-based segmentation. The resulting framework is replicable, scalable, and well suited to behavioral finance applications, including financial advising, wellness interventions, and the design of personalized tools and communications aimed at improving financial decision-making and well-being."}}

Often framed as neutral tools for enhancing productivity, these systems embed continuous algorithmic oversight into daily work routines, intensifying managerial control and reshaping the employment relationship. Drawing on legal, philosophical, and socio-technical scholarship, the article argues that privacy and dignity are mutually reinforcing values, both of which are undermined by pervasive surveillance practices. Privacy is not treated here as a waivable entitlement grounded in individual consent, but rather as a structural safeguard that protects autonomy and supports workers' collective identity and rights. Dignity, in turn, requires that workers be treated as individuals rather than instruments of output. Time-tracking technologies challenge both by normalising constant monitoring, restricting discretion, and reducing labour to data. The article critiques the reliance on individual consent as a regulatory safeguard, highlighting its inadequacy in the context of structural power imbalances. It calls for recognising privacy and dignity as non-waivable rights requiring collective and institutional protections. A regulatory framework based on worker representation in surveillance-related decisions is proposed, shifting oversight away from unilateral employer control. By foregrounding the normative stakes of algorithmic management, the article calls for a measured reassessment of labour law's role in protecting autonomy and dignity in the digital workplace."}}

It is suggested that the Black Scholes model has historically maintained a dominance as the premier option pricing model because the risk free rate is often equal to the Moore's R value particularly near the money. Moore's R leads to correct option prices by definition. At-the-money options are often characterized by a convergence of the risk-free rate and the Moore's R value.at or near the money. This convergence of the discounted cash flow effects embedded in Moore's R (derived from the Fokker-Planck equation) with the risk-free rate for at-the-money options leads to similar expected payoffs and valuations between the two models. Consequently, the bias inherent in the Black-Scholes model is likely minimal or non-existent in this range, which helps to clarify the mispricing tendencies often seen in standard Black-Scholes option valuations. This may explain why the Black Scholes model is relatively useful even without its implied volatility adjustment."}}

The empirical findings reveal that the AML leads to an 8.04% relative increase in labor share among high-monopoly firms and an 8.47% increase on average across all firms, primarily driven by workforce expansion. Theoretical analysis and mechanism analysis demonstrate that the AML increases labor share through \"factor composition effect\", \"cost effect\", and \"administrative regulation effect\". Heterogeneity analysis finds that the AML generates relatively stronger enhancement effects on the labor share of administrative monopoly firms and non-manufacturing firms. This paper further reveals that the AML strengthens SOEs' monopsony power, thereby suppressing the growth of labor share."}}

Thus, we examine how regional changes in the additional rate from the basic regulated fees affect the location of home-visit care establishments under the Public Long-Term Care Insurance Scheme in Japan. Since the additional rateknown as the regional additional rate-varies between municipalities and is revised every three years, we examine the locations of home-visit care establishments three years before and after the April 2015 revision. Other regional attributes correlated with the regional additional rate also affect the location of home-visit care establishments. Therefore, we adopt a double-differencing strategy, focusing on the differences in border areas of each municipality before and after three years of the revision of the regional additional rate. Our findings indicate that the regional additional rate significantly affects the location of these establishments. A 1% increase in the regional additional rate in one of two adjacent municipalities raises that municipality's share of establishments within the pair by approximately 1.26% over the two and a half years following the revision. Therefore, when regional disparities become apparent in the provision of long-term care in the near future, adjusting the regulated fee would be an effective method to address them. These findings have important policy implications, i.e., adjusting regulated fees can be effective in addressing regional disparities in home-visit care services supply."}}

Previous research has focused on infrastructure, such as roads, sewage systems, and electricity, as well as title formalization. However, the impact of the highly-variable quality of dwellings is not fully understood, partly because gang violence has impeded fieldwork. Working with local organizations, we deployed teams of engineers into Colombian informal dwellings, allowing us to quantify their indoors investment deficits and to collect data from a novel household survey. We also trained an LLM using 11,000 photos taken by our field team, producing indoor and exterior AI quality ratings that are highly correlated with expert assessments. In turn, our investment metrics are important determinants of hedonic rental valuations. We find neighborhood violence to be associated with poor mental and physical health. Steep terrain and higher housing investments are associated with greater satisfaction with one's home. Contrary to concerns about crowding, unit size does not predict improved well-being. Surprisingly, only <i>subjective </i>assessments of housing satisfaction stand as significant and consistent predictors of positive family outcomes."}}

These off-platform options generate justified envy, as students may reject their centralized assignment in favor of an outside offer, leaving vacant seats in programs that others would have preferred to their current match. We examine whether sequential assignment procedures can mitigate this inefficiency: they allow students to delay their enrollment decision to potentially receive a better offer later, at the cost of waiting before knowing their final admission outcome. To quantify this trade-off, we estimate a dynamic model of application and acceptance decisions using rich administrative data from the French college admission system, which include rank-ordered lists and waiting decisions. We find that waiting costs are large. Yet, by improving students’ assignment outcomes relative to a standard single-round system, the sequential mechanism decreases the share of students who leave the higher education system without a degree by 5.4% and leads to large welfare gains.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34105\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

To rationalize this, we propose a New Keynesian model that diverges from the existing workhorse model by adding path-dependence (to a forward-looking model) and potentially imperfect central bank credibility. We show that achieving low inflation (hitting the target) requires more aggressive monetary policy reactions, and is costlier from an output point of view, when individuals’ past inflationary experiences shape their inflation expectation formation. In turn, we provide empirical evidence of the need for these two theoretical additions. Countries that experienced a high level of inflation before adopting the IT regime tend to respond more aggressively to deviations of inflation expectations from the central bank’s target. We also point to the existence of a credibility puzzle, whereby the strength of a central bank’s monetary policy response to deviations from the inflation target remains broadly unchanged even as central banks gain credibility over time.

We find little evidence that fossil-fuel plants were disproportionately sited in counties with higher Black population shares on average. However, event study estimates indicate that Black population share grows in the decades after the first fossil-fuel plant is built in a county, with average increases in Black population share of 4 percentage points in the 50-70 years after first siting. These long-run demographic shifts are driven by counties that first hosted a fossil-fuel plant between 1900-1949.

However, when P ≫ T , the RFF-based forecast becomes a weighted average of the T training sample returns, with weights determined by the similarity between the predictor vectors in the training data and the current predictor vector. In short training windows, similarity primarily reflects temporal proximity, so the forecast reduces to a recency-weighted average of the T return observations in the training data—essentially a momentum strategy. Moreover, because similarity declines with predictor volatility, the result is a volatility-timed momentum strategy. The strong performance of the RFF-based strategy thus stems not from its ability to extract predictive signals from the training data, but from the fact that a volatility-timed momentum strategy happened to perform well in historical data. This point becomes clear when applying the same method to artificial data in which returns exhibit reversals rather than momentum: the RFF approach still constructs the same volatility-timed momentum strategy, which then performs poorly.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34104\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

In Davis and Gertler (2015), we used household-level microdata from Mexico to predict future air conditioning adoption as a function of income and temperature. Revisiting these predictions with 12 years of additional data, we find that air conditioning in Mexico has accelerated, significantly exceeding our predictions. Neither errors in predicting income growth or rising temperatures, nor migration patterns, nor an overly restrictive model can explain the large prediction gap. Instead, our results point to the failure to account for falling electricity prices and technological changes in air conditioner efficiency as key drivers of the prediction gap.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34101\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

In both scenarios, we derive optimal tariffs that balance terms-of-trade considerations with strategic incentives to encourage political alignment. We find that when geopolitical concerns are active, the optimal tariff exceeds the classic Mill-Bickerdike level. In a bipolar world, optimal tariffs reflect both economic and political rivalry, and may be strategic complements or substitutes.

Emissions result from consumption and production of a tradeable dirty good, and their intensity depends on the emissions technology.

Policies include emissions taxes and permit trading systems. The costs of collecting emission taxes and administering a permit trading system are lower for the regional governments that the federal government because of informational advantages. Unlike the regions, the federal government internalizes the social costs of emissions borne by both regions.

Using panel data from the German SOEP, I estimate 2SLS models that instrument realized WFH in 2022 with WFH feasibility.

The present study assessed fish abundance and diversity (assemblage composition, alpha and beta diversity, indicator species, and the Species Contribution to Beta Diversity, SCBD) in the Itacaiúnas and Parauapebas river basins in eastern Brazilian Amazonia during the dry and rainy seasons. The study tested the hypothesis that basins near areas impacted by mining have reduced fish abundance and diversity in comparison with control areas. To test this hypothesis, four sampling points were selected per basin (two controls and two impacted areas), for a total of eight points. Fish specimens were collected using gillnets, with the physicochemical parameters of the water being recorded simultaneously. Fish abundance and alpha diversity were greatest during the rainy season, but did not vary significantly between control and impacted areas. Beta diversity was greatest in the Parauapebas basin. Species such as Plagioscion squamosissimus and Pygocentrus nattereri were associated with the control areas, while Satanoperca jurupari was characteristic of the impacted areas. A Redundancy Analysis (RDA) revealed a correlation between environmental variables (temperature, salinity, and conductivity) and species distributions, reflecting the influence of water quality on the fish fauna. The data indicate that phenotypic plasticity may be masking the negative effects of mining by favoring the persistence of the more generalist species. Although abundance and richness do not differentiate impacted areas clearly from preserved areas, the patterns of beta diversity and the presence of indicator species reinforce the need for continuous and integrated monitoring to better assess potential ecological shifts over time."}}

Leveraging transformer-based natural language processing, our model captures contextual and semantic nuances often missed by traditional text classification techniques, enabling more accurate detection of financial constraints. A key contribution is to differentiate between constraints that affect firms presently and those anticipated in the future. These two types of constraints are associated with distinctly different financial profiles: while firms expecting future constraints tend to accumulate cash preemptively, currently constrained firms exhibit reduced liquidity and higher leverage. We show that only firms anticipating financial constraints exhibit significant cash flow sensitivity of cash, whereas currently constrained and unconstrained firms do not. This calls for a narrower interpretation of this widely used cash-based constraints measure, as it may conflate distinct firm types – unconstrained and currently constrained – and fail to capture all financially constrained firms. Our findings underscore the critical role of constraint timing in shaping corporate financial behavior."}}

It introduces the notion of the Tragedy of the Accounting Commons, wherein centralized, top-down governance—primarily through the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)—has led to a disconnect between regulatory frameworks and the diverse needs of stakeholders. As a corrective, the book proposes a decentralized model of financial accounting standards setting, empowering the 50 U.S. states to establish their own elected accounting standards bodies. Two complementary models are articulated: one at the federal level and another at the state level, both designed to reflect the preferences of their respective commons. To address regulatory conflicts and delays, the book also advocates for the creation of Special Accounting Adjudication Courts to facilitate timely resolution between regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and registrants. The analysis further examines the implications of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, particularly Section 704, and the evolving dynamics between U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). By foregrounding the perspectives of commoners—those most affected by accounting regulations—the book envisions a transformative shift in the governance of financial reporting standards. </span>Kindle Edition&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lnkd.in/g56kx7ec\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lnkd.in/g56kx7ec</a>&nbsp;Author Interview&nbsp;<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.elivapress.com/en/news/__;!!K-Hz7m0Vt54!jRHnbSk_m6UeT-bec8jhgkAXZJnvZgb7rgXbDOjD9XM0q0FJonvvkxvuz6wG0vmNg5CjIz2NxQ6jhcYixrXzpcU$\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.elivapress.com/en/news/</a></p>"}}

Moreover, national cultural traits moderate this relationship: the effect strengthens in more individualistic societies, while it weakens in those with higher uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation.

It explores the functions of disgorgement and normatively suggests its ideal relationship with expectation damages through critical analysis of three potential approaches from a law and economics perspective. The most radical approach advocates for the complete replacement of expectation damages with disgorgement, ultimately proven to be infeasible primarily due to the uncertainties over the profits from breach. The second approach considers disgorgement as a generally available alternative to expectation damages. However, existing empirical evidence cannot persuasively support this over the conventional rule of using expectation damages as the primary remedy, thereby to some extent justifying the significant reluctance towards disgorgement on the positive-law level. In this sense, this article contends that the third approach is the most convincing, whereby the plaintiff is entitled to disgorgement only in specific circumstances with particular economic characteristics. Furthermore, this article provides a refined taxonomy of applicable circumstances based on varied underlying economic rationales for justifying the award of disgorgement in each category of circumstances. This taxonomy not only provides robust economic justifications for case laws and legislative provisions explicitly or implicitly endorsing contractual disgorgement across both common law (represented by English and U.S. law) and civil law (represented by German and Chinese law) jurisdictions, but also highlights how to expand the recognition of this remedy in practice."}}

Although national averages of disabled adults have crept upwards, the percentage of students with disabilities in law school appears to be outpacing that increase by significant margins.

Academic disabilities now dominate the ADA-compliance landscape in law schools.<br><br>Based in part on the first survey of ABA-accredited law schools focused onacademic disability accommodations, this Article frames the current landscape in law school higher education. Although disability accommodations in law school far outpace those of the general population, they reflect similar accommodations already granted in undergraduate institutions and by the Law School Admission Council for the LSAT. On the other hand, many state bars do not offer disability accommodations as generous as LSAC or the schools do themselves, leading to pernicious deltas between school-based expectations and licensure reality for disabled students, not to mention expectations in the practice of law. As reflected in the survey, law schools are aware of this and are concerned.

This threat will escalate as these companies increasingly provide genAI-generated custom news articles and videos instead of links to third-party news content. Legislative history makes clear the paramount goal of the antitrust laws is to prevent overconcentration in private industries from impairing the nation’s democracy. Because only the news industry is essential to the functioning of the democratic system, in the landmark 1945 <i>Associated Press</i> case the Supreme Court held that in news market antitrust cases in which liability is found the First Amendment imparts to federal courts a duty to impose remedies designed to assure sufficiently “diverse and antagonistic” news publisher competition to support a well-functioning democracy. Therefore, in the infrequent five-alarm fire instances like now when national news industry overconcentration threatens the democratic system, the enforcement agencies and the federal judiciary may eliminate the threat by enforcing existing antitrust law. Moreover, enforcing the antitrust laws to preserve a sufficiently unconcentrated news industry follows from application of standard antitrust law for differentiated product markets recognized in the Merger Guidelines. That the enforcement agencies are presently not seeking to reduce the news market shares of Google and Meta is one of the greatest abdications of law enforcement responsibility in U.S. history. In the current Google search antitrust trial, the district court should impose remedies that will with certainty reduce Google’s news market share to a non-threatening level. It may do so by imposing a news market share limitation. The Supreme Court made this principle clear in&nbsp;<i>Associated Press</i> when it held that a news publisher may not engage in unlawful anticompetitive conduct to \"keep others from publishing.\" This principle is not surprising since it is like asserting that it does not violate the First Amendment for a court to reduce a news publisher's news market share by requiring it to return printing presses it stole from its competitors.&nbsp;One reason the antitrust enforcement agencies have lost sight of their paramount mission is that the Chicago school of antitrust policy advocated that federal courts ignore the congressionally mandated antitrust goal of protecting the democratic system—even in news market antitrust cases where improved democratic system functioning is a main direct intended benefit of news as a product. (Citizens consume news in part out of civic duty to make more informed voting decisions and the express mission of publishers like <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i> is to publish news to enable better informed voting decisions and policy debates.) Advocates of economics-based antitrust law should promptly help correct this antitrust policy incoherence before it leads to democratic system failure which, if it occurred, foreseeably would harm Americans by on the order of an estimated $290 trillion.</p>"}}

First, fiscal policy plays a critical role in determining both the price level and the long-run rate of inflation. Second, emergency fiscal transfers can be viewed as either funded (backed by future austerity measures) or unfunded. Unfunded fiscal transfers function as “helicopter drops” of money directly to the private sector. Whether this wealth takes the form of new money or new debt is largely irrelevant. Third, at full employment, for a given interest rate structure, injecting nominal wealth leads to a temporary burst of inflation and a permanently higher price level. Fourth, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, central bank interest rate policy can at most influence the inflation dynamic – not the total amount of inflation ultimately realized.</span></p></li>\n <li>\n  <p><span>Normally, a central bank can ignore fiscal policy, or government spending, in pursuing its mandates. However, this can change during major national emergencies – such as unexpected wars or pandemics – when large-scale fiscal expenditures are required. In these events, an unexpected increase in the price level (a short-term increase in the rate of inflation) can lower the cost of capital for financially strained firms. Interest rate policy aimed at curbing inflation in these situations may be counterproductive.</span></p></li>\n <li>\n  <p><span>Viewed in this light, criticism that the Bank of Canada was slow to react to inflationary pressures may be off the mark.

Using 245 PCE sub-indices spanning 1959-2024, we construct an exact bottom-up inflation measure that transparently maps sectoral price-setting behavior into macroeconomic aggregates. Our decomposition reveals fundamental asymmetries in inflation formation: inflationary pressure exhibits dramatic variation (2.35%-12.68%) while deflationary pressure remains remarkably stable (0.72%-5.18%), indicating inflation episodes are primarily driven by surges in upward pricing momentum rather than retreats of downward movements. Historical analysis shows distinct pressure regimes across major macroeconomic episodes: the Great Inflation featured extreme inflationary pressure volatility, the Great Moderation achieved balanced dynamics, the 2008-2009 crisis uniquely witnessed deflationary pressure dominance creating deflation risk, while COVID-19 saw dramatic inflationary pressure resurgence. We reassess the price puzzle using Bayesian local projections with alternative monetary policy shock identifications. Conventional narrative shocks generate sustained inflationary pressure increases with minimal deflationary response, while informationally robust shocks resolve the puzzle completely through both increased deflationary pressure and reduced inflationary pressure, with the deflationary channel providing the dominant contribution consistent with demand-channel transmission. Extensive robustness checks across specifications and estimation methods confirm these findings while revealing the diagnostic value of pressure decomposition for evaluating shock quality. Results demonstrate that the price puzzle reflects informational frictions rather than genuine economic phenomena, and suggest successful monetary policy operates through managing pressure balance with important implications for real-time policy diagnosis and central bank communication."}}

Food and nutritional security is a fundamental right of every person. However, many Africans are deprived of this right. Reports by the FAO and WFP indicate the emergence of an acute food crisis in at least 27 countries. This crisis has escaped the attention of the general press and the political sphere in the West. Yet this is crucial for understanding the reasons behind current migration flows, as well as for stimulating the necessary solidarity interventions. Poverty and malnutrition result from uncontrolled rapid population growth, inefficient agricultural and industrial practices, the high debt profiles of many African countries due to poor governance and corruption, and diseases such as the AIDS epidemic, malaria, the Ebola virus and the current pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Other factors include poor and inadequate health infrastructure and armed conflicts. Despite an abundance of natural resources, the gross domestic product per capita of many African countries is among the lowest in the world. According to FAO data, over 200 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were undernourished between 2014 and 2016. The prevalence of undernourishment in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 181 million people in 2010 to 222 million in 2016. In 2016, Africa had the highest prevalence of undernourishment in the world, estimated at 20% of the population. Poverty is the main cause of hunger and malnutrition in Africa, while hunger and malnutrition exacerbate the problem of disease on the continent. Poverty continues to plague Africa as a result of poor economic policies, conflict, war, environmental factors such as drought and climate change, population growth, poor leadership and greed. This situation is further exacerbated by the vicious cycle of poverty, disease and illness. Whether directly or indirectly, due to inadequate food consumption and poor diet quality, it is also accountable for over half of all deaths among children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sociocultural barriers are major hindrances in some communities, with female children usually being the most affected. Corruption and lack of government interest and investment are key players that must be addressed to solve this problem. Malnutrition was highest within countries in East Africa and West Africa compared to the WHO Millennium development goals target for 2015. The system dynamics simulations forecast a rather gloomy future for the agro-food sector in SSA. Even the historically highest development rate of agricultural production will not be enough to meet the rapidly increasing demand for food. --"}}

RVE 2.0 formalizes an accountability triangle-citizens ↔ governments ↔ employers-with clear cost dashboards, versioned budgets, and feedback loops.

The problem embeds in Samuelson's axiomatic principle-the \"factual assumption\" that natural units of capital designated as unaugmentable dollars that only accumulate and labor as workers that primarily augment frames the tautological result that \"requires technical change to be labor augmenting, and nothing else,\" thereby precluding readily-observable technology-augmenting capital investment. Our theoretical frame uncovers the \"inside anatomy\" of technology and growth by specifying Four Levels of Augmentation: A) Households and firms functioning as platforms for augmentation, optimizing and translating new technologies into growth; B) The brain and machine subsystems serving as the loci of recombinant processing, transforming oldto-new ideas and objects; C) Neural networks and molecular compounds, the \"natural units,\" remixed by brains and machines to augment the A-Level host production factors; and D) Human and physical capital investment animating the (A,B,C) physical processes of augmentation. A foundational principle of recombinant innovation emerges; that is, while conventional theory represents gL and gAL as perfect growth substitutes with gK functioning alone, recombinant innovation requires that factor accumulation and augmentation of physical matter be inseparable-gAL requires gL; gK induces gAK. Hence, the steady-state equation transforms from K ̇=sY to ȦKK=sY and the Harrod function, Y=F(K,AL), to Y=F(AKK,ALL). Consistent with Laibson's assertion that economics need engage with the natural sciences, the paper recognizes the consequential role of nature's physical endowment and its ubiquitous laws in framing modern technical change."}}

Specifically, we argue that China's silver policy risk triggered massive silver outflows that induced a severe credit crunch and further weakened the government's perceived commitment to the silver standard. In turn, such weakened perceived commitment made the silver standard unsustainable. Notably, a contemporaneous comparison with Hong Kong reveals that rising global silver prices did not cause persistent silver outflows or a credit crunch in the absence of silver policy risk. These findings underscore the crucial role of policy risk in shaping economic outcomes in developing economies."}}

These assets have the potential to drive significant economic growth and development. However, despite a decade of resource-driven investments and export growth, the broader socioeconomic impact has remained limited. This study critically examines the role of natural resources in Mozambique's development trajectory, with a focus on how they have been utilized and governed, and what strategies can enhance their contribution to inclusive and sustainable growth. The research adopts a qualitative, case study methodology based on secondary data from government reports, international organizations, academic literature, and policy analyses. Using a political economy framework, the study explores four key dimensions: the structure of the extractive sector, governance and institutions, socioeconomic outcomes, and policy effectiveness. Findings reveal that while extractive industries have increased export earnings and attracted foreign investment, they have failed to generate broad-based benefits for the population. Weak institutions, governance deficits, regional inequalities, and poor implementation of local content and environmental regulations have undermined the developmental potential of resource wealth. The study also highlights the risks of overdependence on fossil fuel exports in the context of global energy transitions and climate change. The article concludes that Mozambique's natural resources can support long-term economic transformation only if supported by transparent governance, institutional reform, economic diversification, and inclusive development policies. It offers policy recommendations focused on strengthening governance, promoting value addition, empowering local communities, and ensuring environmental sustainability. These insights contribute to the broader discourse on the challenges and opportunities of resource-led development in low-income, resource-rich countries."}}

This study aimed to investigate parent interest and preferences in a school-provided meal offering for Australian primary schools. An online survey incorporating a discrete choice experiment was administered to parents of primary school-aged children across Australia. The discrete choice experiment involved 12 choice tasks, where parents were required to choose between two hypothetical school-provided lunch offerings. Six attributes with varying levels were used to describe the choice options: cost, nutrition and quality, environmental sustainability, access, menu options, and the school approach to food. A d-efficient design was constructed, with data analysed using multinomial logit models and the Krinsky and Robb method to calculate willingness to pay. The final sample consisted of 383 participants, predominantly women (90%). A majority expressed interest in school-provided meals (93%). The most significant influence on parent choice was nutrition and quality (β=0.71), followed by menu options (β=0.47), environmental sustainability (β=0.35), and a whole-school approach to food (β=0.28). A negative cost coefficient indicated a preference for lower-cost options. Parents were willing to pay for enhancements, indicating the attributes were financially valued by parents. Results demonstrate Australian parent support for comprehensively designed and delivered school-provided lunches, aligned with their preferences. Parental preferences should be considered in system design, alongside other stakeholder perspectives, to achieve an acceptable and financially equitable school-provided meal system in Australia."}}

Normatively, these tilting responses to low rates are inefficient, but higher capital taxes are not an ideal response. We find empirical support for our tilting mechanism over the last 60 years in the U.S. Quantitatively, we show that the endogenous human capital investment response to low interest rates can account for a 17% rise in cross-sectional labor income variance (higher inequality) and a 7% higher parent-child labor income intergenerational elasticity (lower mobility).\n</div>"}}

Modelers often base these profiles on a single year of data. Because weather impacts generation performance and electricity demand, it is important to ensure CEMs use same-year load and renewable energy production profiles. However, the user is often left to decide which base year to use. Because different years have different load and renewable energy shapes, future projections based on any particular year might yield different optimal futures. The purpose of this study is to test that assumption and assess the impact of the baseline weather year selection on investment decisions made by CEMs for future generation development. We ran twenty CEM simulations of ERCOT from 2022-2050, each with a distinct base weather year from 2002-2021. We find negligible variation with weather year for the bulk grid-wide capacity and energy results, but found that variations in regional capacity, total costs, and emissions were more significant. While these deviations might be tolerable for many projects, we conclude that utilizing multiple weather years will improve model accuracy. Our results indicate that the share of electricity generated by variable sources is consistent across weather years, although the specific mix exhibits noticeable variation. We discover that the precision of simulations with multiple temporal stages can be improved without additional computational cost by utilizing data from a separate weather year during each model period."}}

In real-time forecasting, the cyclical SRU achieves an out-of-sample R2 of up to 14.22%, outperforming both a constant expected return model and a range of widely used macroeconomic and financial predictors. Furthermore, it delivers substantial economic value for mean-variance investors, enhancing utility gains and Sharpe ratios. The cyclical component exhibits stronger linkages to interest rates, economic activities, and investor sentiment compared to the slow-moving component, which accounts for its superior predictive performance. Within the present-value framework, we demonstrate that the predictive power of SRU primarily stems from its ability to forecast future cash flows."}}

Specifically, we estimate outcomes using areas 10-15 km from camp boundaries as the control group, and we also use propensity score matching on pre-treatment forest and settlement cover in combination with a DID specification. We explore the parallel trends assumption further using the HonestDID approach. Within the local area 0-5 km outside of camps, forest cover falls by 7-8 percentage points (ppt) after camp openings and settlement cover increases by 10-11 ppt. Heterogeneity analysis reveals no significant impacts of camp opening on nearby protected areas. A robustness check using the Global Land Cover 30m resolution data supports our main findings but yields smaller coefficient estimates due to greater random error in a globally calibrated product."}}

These impacts disturb local residents and have triggered public complaints to wind power projects. However, research on the negative externalities of wind power and their associated costs remains scarce in China. To address this gap, this study employs the Contingent Valuation Method to quantify wind energy externalities and their costs through a survey of 185 residents near the Changgao Wind Farm in Northeast China. We reveal that noise is the most pronounced externality, showing a distance-dependent attenuation pattern: 75% of residents within 600 meters of wind turbines report moderate-to-significant noise, decreasing to 58% between 600 and 1,000 meters, and 54% between 1,000 and 1,500 meters. Beyond 1,500 meters, no significant noise is heard, and 71% report negligible impact. Other notable externalities include landscape changes, shadow flicker, concerns about turbine accidents, precipitation impact uncertainties, and unpleasant odors. Positive perceptions include an increased power supply and environmental benefits. The median willingness to pay (WTP) to prevent construction is 4.0 CNY/month/household, and the willingness to accept (WTA) compensation is 9.6 CNY/month/household. Factors such as age, household size, noise perception, landscape changes, safety concerns, land compensation, and perceived benefits significantly influence WTP/WTA values. These empirical results provide valuable insights for establishing science-based buffer zones and equitable compensation mechanisms in China&apos;s wind energy development."}}

However, achieving high perceptual quality while preserving crucial structural details remains a challenge, often at the expense of computational efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce ESTPSR, an efficient GAN-based framework specifically designed for enhanced structure and texture reconstruction. ESTPSR incorporates Attentionguided Mixed Dilated Residual Blocks (AMDRBs), which efficiently extract both local and global features by combining standard and dilated convolutions with the parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism. Additionally, its gradient-guided branch generates high-resolution gradient maps that serve as structural priors, guiding the super-resolution process. To improve training stability and perceptual quality, a Residual Relativistic average Patch Discriminator (RRPD) is developed that evaluates patch-wise relative authenticity, leveraging residual connections. Compared to the baseline SRGAN model, ESTPSR achieves up to +0.84dB gain in PSNR, a 36% reduction in LPIPS, and a 12% improvement in Perceptual Index (PI) on the Set14 dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ESTPSR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and perceptual evaluations, while maintaining a significantly lower parameter count (1.35M) compared to state-of-the-art models."}}

To overcome these challenges, we propose a new PFL framework, termed SPAlign, which uses structure-aware smooth perception for heterogeneous feature alignment. Specifically, SPAlign integrates: Intra-client structure rectification: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with intra-class standardization yields perceptual logit, enhancing intra-class compactness; Inter-client representation alignment: Unified statistical space mapping reduces τ-sensitivity by >30% and eliminates cross-client scale discrepancies. Under guidance from historical personalized models, SPAlign optimizes distillation to harmonize client adaptation and global consistency. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of SPAlign over existing state-of-the-arts. Notably, SPAlign exhibits enhanced robustness and personalization, especially under highly heterogeneous data distributions and large-scale client settings."}}

The hypothesized return drift is premised on the notion that investor sentiment and market dynamics are significantly altered by the information disseminated at these conferences. Investors, reacting to both anticipatory signals and post-announcement adjustments, tend to drive prices in a measurable manner in the windows immediately preceding, during, and after the events. By systematically analyzing stocks of companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, this study aims to validate the existence of these drift patterns and shed light on the underlying mechanisms, thereby enhancing mutual understanding of event-driven asset pricing dynamics."}}

The analysis identifies environmental regulation stringency and firms’ financial trading capacity as key factors influencing capacity adjustment, while interregional power transmission plays a mitigating role. This paper introduces and conceptualizes the phenomenon of “passive idleness” as a novel form of overcapacity, contributing to the theoretical understanding of electricity market reform. The findings offer important policy implications, highlighting the need to balance market efficiency with institutional equity in the ongoing transition toward a more market-oriented power sector."}}

The short-sell hedging demand is inelastic to fees. The positive fee effect with increased hedging becomes significantly strong for expensive-to-borrow stocks that have liquid at-the-the-money warrants. Traders who engage in such hedging have a solid motivation to manage downside risk due to price fluctuations and active hedge re-balancing requirements because of the sensitive delta. This risk management requirement is reflected in fees charged by lenders. Our analysis provides insights into whether regulators and investors should be wary of increased bearish trading strategies in the derivatives market, which could inflate short-selling costs in the lending market. We further find that derivatives hedgers’ demand is sensitive to fees before negative earnings announcements, i.e., hedgers’ short-selling demand declines with higher loan fees. This effect reflects the fact that such hedgers short when they expect higher selling pressure, i.e., they sell low. In contrast, we find that the short-selling demand of traders who are not hedgers is positively associated with costs before the negative earnings information because they feel an urgency to generate profit with overvalued stocks; in other words, they sell high when in receipt of private bad news."}}

However, this task presents several challenges, including the inherent disorder of point cloud data, the irregularity of geometric structures, and the uneven distribution of point density. In unsupervised 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, performance is hindered by two key obstacles: limitations in the sample distribution of feature learning and insufficient discriminability of feature representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates a Memory Enhancer and an AttnPnP module. The framework employs cross-batch diverse contrastive learning to mitigate pseudo-label noise and enhance feature discriminability, issues stemming from reliance on single-batch features. Additionally, InfoNCE loss is applied at the superpoint level to reinforce intra-primitive feature compactness and inter-primitive separation. Finally, the AttnPnP module refines feature representations by enforcing local geometric and global semantic constraints.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the mean intersection over union from 44.5% to 47.04% on the S3DIS dataset and from 13.1% to 14.79% on the SemanticKITTI dataset, surpassing the baseline performance. The proposed approach significantly enhances feature generalization and semantic clustering precision in unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation, offering an innovative and practical solution for advancing unsupervised 3D scene understanding."}}

We report that Te is moderately enriched (~21 ppm) in the Shuimuchong tailings (Tongling, China) with distinct vertical stratification. Multi-scale analytical techniques (ICP-MS, XRD, TIMA, XPS) reveal trace Te occurring as native Te and telluride minerals (e.g., tetradymite), encapsulated in garnet and pyrite near the surface and present as larger discrete phases at depth. Te concentrations peak at ~26-27 ppm around 10-20 cm depth, coinciding with less-weathered horizons. Redox stratification governs Te speciation: surface oxidation produces soluble Te(IV) oxyanions (tellurite) while deeper anoxic conditions preserve elemental Te(0). Consequently, oxidized Te(IV) in shallow tailings is more mobile and poses greater leaching and ecotoxic risk, whereas reduced Te(0) at depth remains immobile. Our findings underscore occurrence patterns of tellurium, as a strategic mineral in the tailings: the risk of toxic Te release from surface weathering with the secondary-resource potential of Te sequestered in deeper layers."}}

These students are always at considerable risk of exclusion and further marginalization in education and societal processes. This study aims to investigate the existing scenario of marginalization and exclusion of young students in Bangladesh and find plausible ways to solve the issue.  This paper is based on a qualitative phenomenological study combining an ethnographic research approach and thematic analysis with empirical data. Primary data were collected through in-depth interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire from teachers, parents of marginalized students, and education officers. After collecting data, they were transcribed into Word files. This study analyzed data using NVivo-15 software and found several themes and sub-themes through coding the interviewees’ descriptions. The study has explored the major causes of marginalization and exclusion, which are parents’ illiteracy and unconsciousness, the impact of family poverty, social environments, and the adverse role of teachers and school authority. Lack of counselling and negative attitudes of teachers and school authorities lead the marginalized students to exclusion. The authors have found several recommendations from respondents to fight against marginalization and exclusion; those are shown in five sub-themes: economic development, social movements, communication and counselling, government and legal actions, and supervision and collaboration. Additionally, this study has revealed the inconsistency between education theory and policy and education practice. The circumstances in which disadvantaged children grow and the interactions they experience at school have a deep impact on their future development because school instigates marginalization, failing to consider individual pupils’ needs."}}

We develop an endogenous growth model featuring expanding product varieties, in which data is generated as a by-product of consumption and utilized as a nonrival input in production. Firms incur a one-time fixed cost to undergo digital transformation, creating multiple equilibrium possibilities depending on the presence of a data market. Our results demonstrate that digital transformation sustainably enhances economic growth only when supported by an active data market. Although digital transformation initially crowds out market entry, this effect is temporary and does not resolve persistent entry insufficiency caused by monopolistic markups. Extending the analysis to heterogeneous firms, we further reveal that early adopters of digital technologies gain stronger market power, highlighting additional distributional implications of entering the data economy"}}

In our advanced online experiment, we introduce (1) policy regulation, i.e., fines or incentives; (2) scenarios with high or low risk of penalty fines; and (3) bronze, silver, and gold Ecobadge tiers that could be attained by adopting pro-conservation practices. We recruited 399 participants to make decisions over a cumulative 7,980 simulated years, observing that participants sacrificed a higher USD payout to achieve, most commonly, tier two `silver&apos; Ecobadge (45\\% of all decision years). This nonmonetary award system embedded within our simulation based experiment allows us to identify effects of policy and social interaction on farm management decisions. We found that installing a riparian buffer strip significantly increased the odds that participants would apply a higher amount of manure. We also unveil potential ripple effects of policy: combining a fine for excess nutrient runoff with an incentive for no-till management increased the odds participants applied less manure. In our post-experiment survey we asked participants to rate their agricultural knowledge, and then tested their actual knowledge, finding that correct answers were significantly correlated with pro-conservation behavior and vice versa. Interestingly, self-reported agricultural knowledge correlated with anti-conservation farm management when risk of a fine was high. To improve the efficiency of future conservation policies seeking to motivate farmers, here we use serious games to examine the effects of nonmonetary awards and policy interventions."}}
