Despite numerous bibliometric indicators proposed to capture novelty, previous efforts of measurement validation remain insufficient. This study addresses this gap by evaluating a range of novelty indicatorsemploying various operationalisation strategies-against self-reported novelty assessments obtained from our originally designed questionnaires covering multiple novelty dimensions. Correlation analyses between the self-assessed scores and bibliometric indicators offer several insights. First, while most indicators detect some aspects of novelty, an indicator may not capture all forms of novelty. Second, a disciplinary comparison reveals that the indicators' performance varies across fields-some indicators demonstrate consistent correlations across disciplines while others show correlations only in limited disciplines. Third, as using language models in novelty evaluation has become common, our analysis shows that indicators based on a contextual language model outperform those based on a static model. Fourth, we examine ex-post indicators, which require post-publication data (e.g., forward citation), and find that they offer no clear advantages over ex-ante indicators. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current indicators and offer implications for future indicator development and the application of the indicators."}}

Unlike informal social media channels, these platforms enable official responses from firm representatives, typically board secretaries, under direct regulatory oversight. By analyzing rumor-related Q&amp;A pairs with regression models and several robustness checks, we find that firms can benefit from strategic response messaging. Our results show that prompt responses from management have a positive effect on the stock market. Interestingly, responses that closely match the questions do not necessarily lead to improved ARs. Responses that convey more positive emotions are associated with higher subsequent gains in ARs. Further, we investigate the role of specific conditions, including prior stock performance, investor sentiment in questions, and question topics, in the relationship between response behavior and investor reaction. These findings offer new insights into the consequences of management responses to unconfirmed events and highlight the potential value of Q&amp;A communication between firm managers and potential investors."}}

To provide foundational insights, we conduct a survey of investors to assess their awareness, usage, and perceptions of firm-investor Q&amp;A platforms. In the subsequent empirical study, we specifically focus on the substance of managers' responses, which are primarily aimed at clarifying firm events or information. In terms of linguistic properties, our attention is directed towards the use of causal explanations within managers' responses on investor interactive platforms. Through an examination of user-generated content, i.e., Q&amp;A pairs on the investor interactive platform, we discern a positive correlation between the use of causal language in managerial responses and subsequent investor engagement in firm-investor Q&amp;A communications. In addition, we highlight the role of negation words and response relevance, two language attributes indicating the diagnosticity and informativeness of responses in corporate communication efforts. These findings contribute to a more profound understanding of online communications between firms and potential investors, emphasizing their significance in the management of investor relations.

This paper examines how algorithmic personalization affects the visibility and demand for service providers from non-preferred demographic groups on online platforms in the presence of consumer bias. Using a simple theoretical model and simulations, we compare uniform and personalized ranking algorithms. While both ranking methods disadvantage non-preferred groups as bias increases, personalization can mitigate these effects by shielding them from aggregate discrimination. Specifically, non-preferred service providers are more likely to appear at the top of rankings and receive greater demand under personalization when consumer bias is high and search costs are nontrivial. These findings challenge the prevailing view that personalization necessarily exacerbates social inequities in digital marketplaces. The implications can be extended to various platforms that incorporate user preferences--explicitly or implicitly--into their ranking algorithms."}}

Although prior literature has explored the binary provision of virtual agents in gaming, research on technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) powered virtual opponents, remains limited. In this study, we investigate how introducing AI agents as virtual opponents (versus rule-based opponents) influences human players’ engagement and performance. Leveraging a large-scale quasi-field experiment in a multiplayer online racing game, we employ difference-in-differences analyses with matching strategies and show that, on average, the introduction of AI opponents can have ‘discouragement effects’ on players, resulting in reduced player engagement and decreased performance. Our research also reveals differences in the long-term effects of AI opponents on engagement and performance. In addition, our mechanism exploration reveals that introducing AI opponents increases competition intensity and immersion in the game, and these two factors exhibit opposing influences on players’ subsequent behavior. Specifically, heightened competition hinders players’ further engagement and performance progression, whereas a more immersive experience encourages more gaming participation and better performance. Further, we find the effects of AI opponents on player engagement and performance vary by player motivation and skill levels, such that competition-oriented and highly skilled players are more receptive to AI opponents. Moreover, our findings indicate that optimal engagement and performance outcomes occur when players compete against opponents with comparable and low competence levels, respectively. Lastly, we observe an inverted U-shaped relationship between the proportion of AI opponents and players’ engagement and performance, wherein both insufficient and excessive exposure to AI opponents lead to diminishing outcomes. Our study contributes to the literature on human-AI interactions by offering novel empirical evidence on the impact of AI opponents on human players’ experiential and instrumental outcomes and disentangling the underlying mechanisms. This work also offers practical implications for game designers and policymakers regarding the design of AI-integrated competitive environments.&nbsp;"}}

In this paper, we build on social influence theory and integrate it with the concept of inferences of manipulative intent (IMI) to develop a model that examines how perceptions of sender characteristics—cybersecurity expertise, coercive power, and similarity—can yield positive and negative influence on message outcomes, captured in recipients’ message compliance intentions. We test our model in four different studies using field and scenario experiments across three target populations: the general public, students, and employees. Perceived expertise, power, and similarity had similar effects among the general public and students: Perceived expertise was positively associated with message outcomes, but perceived power and similarity were negatively associated. In contrast, employees reacted differently from the general public and students in that they responded positively to perceived power, with perceived expertise and similarity having negligible effects. Across these three target populations, we found that participants reacted to senders high in perceived power and similarity with IMI, which reduced their message compliance intentions. Our results suggest that senders must be chosen carefully, depending on the target population, because selecting the wrong sender can increase the likelihood of a message being rejected.</span></p>"}}

These systems help reduce paperwork, speed up transactions, and allow businesses to stay competitive in an everchanging marketplace. However, as more sensitive information flows through these online platforms, SMEs face mounting cybersecurity risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and even tampering with transaction records. Unlike large corporations with dedicated IT teams, many SMEs lack the technical expertise and financial resources needed to implement robust security measures. This makes them particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks and fraud, which can have devastating effects on their operations and reputation. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a security framework specifically designed with SMEs in mind, lightweight enough to run efficiently on limited hardware but strong enough to safeguard sensitive data. My approach builds on existing security methods like HTTPS, OAuth2, and digital signatures, but goes further by addressing their limitations in low-resource environments. I incorporate symmetric encryption to protect data efficiently without overwhelming systems and use blockchain-based anchoring to create immutable, verifiable audit trails that keep transaction histories transparent and tamper-proof while maintaining confidentiality. For managing user access and authentication, the framework leverages Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) combined with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which offer scalable and privacy-respecting identity management suited for SMEs. I also compare centralized and decentralized deployment options, weighing trade-offs in latency, scalability, and operational costs. My simulations demonstrate that this balanced approach not only improves security, but also remains practical and affordable for smaller businesses. By tailoring cryptographic tools to real-world SME constraints, this framework empowers smaller companies to confidently embrace digital procurement processes, helping them build trust with partners and customers in a rapidly evolving ecommerce landscape."}}

It sustains the ecosystems on which organizations depend, while simultaneously being threatened by organizational activities. By highlighting this dynamic of impact and dependence, the integration of biodiversity into management discourse offers an opportunity to foster a more holistic understanding of the business-nature relationship, grounded in a systems perspective. At the same time, however, there is a risk that biodiversity will be reduced to yet another environmental variable subsumed within the prevailing business-case logic that views nature primarily as a source of economic value. This approach has proven inadequate to drive the transformative change needed to address the environmental crisis. Drawing on a discussion among scholars, this essay outlines six critical challenges-measurement, strategic decision making, innovation, public policy, interdisciplinary approaches, and dominant ontologies-which, depending on how they are addressed, may either catalyze a rethinking of the business-nature relationship or merely perpetuate existing paradigms."}}

Using PLS-SEM analysis of 675 consumers, we find that environmental consciousness serves as the primary strategic lever for green food purchase intentions, mediating relationships between information availability and purchase behavior. Product attributes demonstrate dual strategic pathways: directly influencing purchase intentions while simultaneously strengthening consumer environmental consciousness. Information availability requires mediation through environmental consciousness to effectively drive purchase behavior, challenging traditional direct-marketing approaches. Demographic analysis reveals that female, older, and more educated consumers demonstrating stronger environmental consciousness and green purchase intentions. These findings contribute to sustainable consumption literature by introducing the Environmental Consciousness Mediation Model and providing empirical evidence for consciousness-driven business strategies in emerging markets. The research offers strategic guidance for green food businesses, emphasizing environmental consciousness-building approaches over product-focused marketing strategies, with implications for competitive advantage in sustainability-conscious markets.</span>"}}

Using a qualitative and descriptive research approach, the study conducts a comprehensive literature review to analyze how these intrinsic motivations shape digital consumer behavior. Findings reveal that online shoppers are motivated not just by product needs but by emotional desires such as stress relief, entertainment, trend exploration, and social validation.

By treating stars as \"fossils\" that record the conditions of their birth, we can decode the assembly history of the Milky Way. We dissect the Galaxy's main components-the thin and thick disks, the stellar halo, and the bulge/bar-using their distinct chemical signatures (e.g., [α/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]) and kinematics to reveal a complex, multi-stage formation process. A detailed case study of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger illustrates how a single major accretion event profoundly sculpted the early Galaxy by heating its proto-disk and triggering a massive starburst. Finally, we look to the future, where next-generation observatories like the JWST and the Roman Space Telescope will extend these archaeological techniques to external galaxies, transforming the study of our Milky Way into a truly comparative science of galactic assembly."}}

This article examines the relationship between creative thinking variables and student outcomes in Spain using 30,800 15-year-old students from 966 schools in the PISA 2022 data set. A two-level cross-sectional multilevel modeling (MLM) approach was implemented to examine the relationships between student-and school-level predictors on outcomes of mathematics achievement, life satisfaction, and stress resistance. The analysis found that creative thinking was a statistically significant positive predictor of mathematics achievement at the student level (β = 3.95, p &lt; .001) and school level (β = 2.55, p &lt; .001). On the other hand, well-being outcomes were predicted by different factors; creative selfefficacy was a strong, positive predictor of both higher life satisfaction (β = 0.17, p &lt; .001) and greater stress resistance (β = 0.10, p &lt; .001), whereas student creative thinking performance had no significant relationship with stress resistance and a small negative relationship with life satisfaction. This study helps clarify the different roles of creative performance and creative self-efficacy, suggesting that while cognitive creative skills are associated with academic success, it is a student's belief in their creative ability that is the most important for their well-being. Additionally, this study emphasizes the importance of school context and suggests that it is an important next step for educational policies in Spain to support creative thinking for academic use and nurture students' creative self-efficacy for all-around development."}}

The literature on Fair-Division-Problems has developed several algorithm to reallocate goods among two or more actors in a way which features desirable properties, such as efficiency, equitability, or envy-freeness. The idea is, that these features assure that the resulting allocation is voluntarily accepted by the actors involved. Fair-Divisionalgorithms, classic one like Knaster, \"Divide and Choose\", or Moving Knife, but also more recent ones, such as the Adjusted Winner developed by Brams/Taylor (1996), are based on the assumption of linear-additive preferences. An alternative for reallocation problems are exchange models, such as the one elaborated by Coleman (1990), which are based on the assumption of Cobb-Douglas preferences. Typically, assumptions and algorithms constitute a package, which is also linked to the application: Algorithms for linear-additive preferences are used for fair-division problems, exchange models with Cobb-Douglas preferences for other economic problems. This paper asks whether the assumptions or the algorithms itself produce allocations with certain, desirable properties. First, the paper evaluates the exchange model proposed by Coleman in terms of the fair division criteria, notably envy-freeness. Second, it compares algorithms and their outcomes to inquire into whether the properties of the resulting allocation-notably using Proportional Allocation, Adjusted Winner and Exchange Models-are a consequence of the assumed preferences or inherent to the allocation algorithm."}}

This study investigates how firms at varying stages of the product life cycle respond to regulatory reforms designed to lower the costs of going public. Exploiting the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act as a quasi-natural experiment and employing a difference-indifferences framework, the paper provides novel evidence that a firm's product life cycle stage critically influences its innovation trajectory following regulatory relief. Early-stage newly public firms experienced increased access to capital and R&amp;D spending but produced fewer patents of lower technological quality and market value compared to mature-stage firms. Mature-stage firms, in contrast, translated the regulatory changes into significant improvements in both innovation output and quality. Additionally, early-stage post-JOBS firms acquired fewer external innovations and faced higher failure rates than their mature counterparts. These findings underscore the importance of considering product life cycle dynamics in designing policies aimed at fostering innovation and ensuring the viability of newly public firms. The results also offer important insights into the ongoing discourse on promoting a vibrant IPO market and the role of tailored regulatory approaches."}}

This paper derives the optimal disclosure policies for competing, cross-owned firms, showing how these are affected by technological spillovers, the intensity of competition, and the nature of product markets. The results show that cross-ownership induces more firm disclosures, which can promote a firm's own profit (at low-spillover values) or the rival's profit (at high-spillover values). The increased transparency under cross-ownership can generate Pareto gains, improving consumer surplus and firm profits relative to separate ownership. This unifying finding holds under quantity and price competition, challenging the view that cross-ownership leads firms to collude, hurting consumers. Additionally, with cross-ownership, we find that high-spillover disclosures occur more under price than quantity competition. Thus, price competition can generate Pareto gains, contradicting the view that such competition favors consumers but at the expense of firms."}}

In developing regions such as Ekiti State, Nigeria, the integration of ICT into the educational sector has the potential to bridge communication gaps, improve access to information, and facilitate collaborative learning and administration. However, the effective use and impact of ICT in enhancing communication within this sector remains inadequately explored. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to assess the role of ICT in enhancing communication across various levels of the educational sector in Ekiti State. Specifically, it evaluated how ICT tools are being adopted by teachers, administrators, and students, and examined the extent to which these technologies have improved communication effectiveness and educational outcomes. <b>Method:</b> The research employed a mixed-method approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques. A total of 150 respondents comprising teachers, school administrators, and students were selected using stratified random sampling across public and private secondary schools in Ekiti State. Structured questionnaires were administered alongside semi-structured interviews to gather comprehensive insights. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics (mean, frequency, and percentage) and thematic analysis for qualitative responses. <b>Results:</b> The findings revealed that a significant number of schools had begun to adopt ICT tools such as email, WhatsApp groups, interactive portals, and educational platforms for communication purposes. Respondents reported improved coordination between teachers and administrators, enhanced access to academic information by students, and increased engagement in academic discussions. However, challenges such as inadequate ICT infrastructure, irregular power supply, and limited digital literacy among staff and students were identified as major barriers to effective ICT utilization. <b>Conclusion:</b> The study concluded that ICT plays a pivotal role in enhancing communication within Ekiti State's educational sector, contributing to more effective teaching, administrative coordination, and student engagement. Nonetheless, for ICT to be fully optimized there is a need for investment in infrastructure, capacity-building for stakeholders, and supportive policies to address the digital divide. Future efforts should focus on expanding access, promoting ICT literacy, and integrating ICT tools into all facets of educational communication."}}

The scope of CSOs is diverse and expansive, encompassing the third sector, nonprofit organizations, non-governmental organizations, public charities, independent departments, foundations, community organizations, and more. In other words, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide are facing rapid changes and challenges. Many civil concerns and issues are evolving rapidly, while governmental systems may face constraints and lengthy policy-making processes, leading to potential delays in addressing public needs and resulting in government failure. Therefore, nonprofit organizations play a crucial role in this dilemma, contributing to public affairs and social welfare.This study investigates how Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Taiwan contribute to alleviating poverty, particularly by providing services to homeless populations. It will examine how these organizations leverage their resources, what strategies they employ, and how they collaborate to assist the government and society in jointly alleviating poverty. This paper addresses three core research questions: (1) How these civil society organizations leverage their resources and what strategies these civil society organizations employ? (2) What specific strategies do civil society organizations employ in addressing homelessness and alleviating poverty? (3) How do civil society organizations collaborate with the government and broader society to jointly alleviate poverty? This paper will conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with key informants from both traditional and emerging CSOs, including \"Do You a Flavor,\" \"Homeless Taiwan Association,\" and the \"Buddhist Tzu Chi Charity Foundation.\" The findings reveal that CSOs play a complementary role in public governance, offering flexible, empathetic, and localized responses where state mechanisms fall short."}}

Since real-market testing is not feasible, we use laboratory experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of redemption fees and gates in reducing money market fund runs, in a setting where investors may withdraw preemptively. We find that fees significantly reduce the propensity to run compared to the baseline without liquidity management tools, whereas gates do not lower the propensity to run. However, the effect of fees on withdrawal behavior is relatively small and takes some time to materialize. Overall, our experimental results indicate that preemptive runs are a real concern and that liquidity management tools are unlikely to eliminate fund fragility, which is consistent with the experience of the 2020 money market fund turmoil.\n</div>"}}

We further explore the determinants of IPO performance, emphasizing the predictive power of issue rating as an indicator of both immediate and long-term outcomes. Our findings reveal that investors can enhance returns by selling stocks immediately upon listing to capitalize on initial underpricing, repurchasing highly rated stocks after initial effects subside, and avoiding long-term holdings of poorly rated issues.

It explores whether cooperatives, by their collective nature, enhance or hinder competition and how legal exemptions shape their operation within market economies. Drawing on statutory frameworks, case law, and economic theory, the paper investigates whether cooperation and competition are reconcilable goals, especially in the context of multi-tiered cooperative models such as India's Anand Pattern. The analysis highlights that while cooperatives can foster inclusive growth and market fairness by enabling smaller producers to compete with dominant firms, they may also exhibit cartel-like behaviors that risk violating antitrust principles. U.S. jurisprudence has attempted to strike a balance by granting limited exemptions under the Capper-Volstead Act, treating cooperatives as single entities for antitrust purposes while curbing predatory conduct. In contrast, Indian law lacks such sector-specific exemptions, leading to ambiguity in how cooperatives are treated under the Competition Act. Using case studies such as dairy cooperatives (e.g., AMUL, KMF) and hypothetical models like commuter transport cooperatives, the paper explores tensions between producer welfare under cooperative law and consumer welfare under competition law. It critiques judicial endorsement of \"avoiding unhealthy competition\" as a legacy of India's socialist past and analyzes the Competition Commission of India's inconsistent treatment of cooperative members as both unified entities and individual competitors. Ultimately, the paper argues against a blanket Capper-Volstead-style exemption in India. Instead, it proposes a functional approach where cooperatives must demonstrate adherence to cooperative principles and economic efficiency to qualify for protection. By conceptualizing cooperative members as productive investor-divisions rather than independent competitors, the paper suggests a framework that preserves the collaborative ethos of cooperatives while aligning with the objectives of antitrust law."}}

However, increased access to domestic high-income markets was not as transformative as exporting. While wages increased, this was limited to production workers, who are typically less skilled than non-production workers. It also did not lead to more intensive use of non-production labor. Moreover, there were no effects on the prices of intermediate inputs or the share of imported inputs, suggesting that plants did not use higher-quality inputs.

We examine whether voters punish or reward incumbent mayors for these events and how the electoral fortunes of challengers are affected. We employ a quasi-experimental event study design using a two-way fixed-effects regression model on a comprehensive dataset of U.S. mayoral elections. This approach allows us to isolate the causal effect of a mass shooting on candidate vote share and win probability while controlling for time-invariant city characteristics and national trends. Our findings reveal a stark paradox of accountability. A mass shooting precipitates a substantial and durable electoral penalty for nonincumbent candidates, reducing their vote share by approximately 10 percentage points. Conversely, incumbent mayors are completely insulated from this blame; the electoral effect for them is statistically indistinguishable from zero. We find no evidence that these events affect broader electoral dynamics such as voter turnout or candidate entry. These results challenge standard models of retrospective voting. They suggest that in the face of community trauma, voters engage in a form of \"biased attentiveness,\" shielding the incumbent as a symbol of stability while punishing challengers who are perceived as introducing political conflict. This dynamic insulates leaders from accountability, reinforces the status quo, and raises critical questions about the functioning of democratic accountability in an age of crisis."}}

In spite of the CBAM's focus on products whose production heavily relies on fossil fuels, agri-food products are not yet directly subject to carbon pricing at the farm gate However, on top of agricultural production inputs such as nitrogen fertilisers, all farm-to-fork transport will be subject to the EU's carbon pricing system when entering the EU. The review and analysis in this paper focus on the potential impacts of different conceptualisations of the CBAM, especially on African countries, from a joint economic and legal perspective that includes issues related to World Trade Organization rules and trade and investment treaties. Our enquiry aims to provide a more holistic perspective on the CBAM than previous works, also by including related policy items within the Green Deal that may have potentially bigger trade impacts on Africa than the CBAM, such as the EU deforestation mitigation regulation (EUDR). These Green Deal regulations take on board European producer and consumer food security concerns, yet they fail to account for similar concerns of African farmers, food traders, processors and consumers. Applying a qualitative research approach, we conjecture that the impact of the CBAM on the food value chain could affect African food trade even more than other regions. We find that the CBAM is a unilateral measure adopted in Brussels without consultations with the EU's trading partners. We suggest that, initially, the CBAM will likely have only a limited 'knock-on' impact on Africa's agri-food exports. However, the CBAM, the EUDR and other measures aimed at promoting greener production, trade and investment have raised numerous development, efficiency and equity concerns. African policymakers and value chain operators, as well as stakeholders with social and environment concerns, will want to adapt production, processing and export standards to maintain market access and profitability."}}

Utilizing both Input-Output Analysis (IOA) and Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) models, the research assesses how cost shocks propagate from primary producers to final consumers. The findings reveal that energy price fluctuations significantly impact agricultural input costs, with knock-on effects on food processing, retail, and hospitality sectors. Scenario analysis using the IOA model indicates that between January 2021 and August 2022, a 55% increase in agricultural input costs would led to a 33.8% rise in final prices. Additionally, between January 2021 and December 2023, output price increased in agriculture, which alone would have contributed to an 11.3% rise in food industry prices. With the SVAR, we estimate the persistence and transmission of shocks through the supply chain, revealing that energy price fluctuations contribute approximately 20% to inflation in the specialty food retail sector, while sector-specific factors account for the majority of the change. Cumulative impulse-response functions show that a (revealed during the cited period) 120% increase in energy price growth leads to a 30% rise in primary sector price growth and a 12% increase in food industry price growth, with delayed but significant effects across industries. The study highlights key policy considerations, including the need for supply chain resilience measures, targeted price stabilization mechanisms, and safeguards for vulnerable consumers against inflationary pressures."}}

Traditional time series and machine learning approaches have performed well under stable consumption patterns. However, the rise of active consumers with flexible assets, such as solar-plus-storage systems and electric vehicles, introduces new complexities. These consumers exhibit behind-the-meter behavior that is generally unobservable to system operators and retailers, who can typically only measure net demand at the boundary meters which are located at the connection points to the grid. Net demand reflects the aggregate of baseload consumption, flexible load shifting, and self-generation, all of which may respond nonlinearly to market prices. As these unobservable components grow, existing forecasting models may fail to capture the true dynamics of consumer behavior. This work develops and implements a data-driven inverse optimization framework to reveal behind-the-meter consumption patterns using only net demand data. By analyzing net demand as revealed at the grid connection point, we estimate parameters for a latent optimization model, enabling predictions that infer the unobservable components. This enables more accurate point and probabilistic forecasting of electricity demand under varying price signals.

We then investigate the optimality of a subsidy financed by the policy maker covering a percentage of the renovation cost.Our results show that the cost of reducing carbon emissions increases exponentially with CO2 abatement. Furthermore, without subsidies, only 15% of the investments recommended to improve energy efficiency result in a positive private net present value (NPV) and are likely to be implemented, while the adoption of a subsidy that covers 50% of the upfront costs increases the percentage of recommended investments with positive private NPV to 29%.Finally, we combine EPC data with information on household characteristics (from the Census) and expenditure (from the Households Budget Survey) using a probabilistic matching technique. We find that, without any subsidy, renovation investments represent an average upfront cost of approximately 23% of annual household spending, while a 50% subsidy reduces the incidence in the annual household budget to 11%. Finally, we show that household characteristics play a far less important role than dwelling attributes in determining the likelihood of a recommendation being implemented. (227)"}}

This has raised concerns about potential negative effects on liquidity in long-term electricity markets, but the scientific literature has yet to conduct corresponding analyses. To address this gap, we developed a modelling approach to quantify expected futures market volumes and evaluate resulting churn rates. We demonstrated it for the German electricity futures market and found that in the beginning of the considered period, general market characteristics dictated liquidity developments. Yet, CfDs became increasingly more decisive for the market outcome. We found that the impact of CfDs on liquidity can largely be altered through specific design decisions, such as duration, share, and reference price design. While some measures were more suitable for addressing either minimum or average churn rates, different combinations emerged to be able to reach similar liquidity targets. Lastly, we demonstrate the importance of selecting an appropriate counterfactual for evaluating modelling results and drawing conclusions."}}

This research examines the intricate relationships among technological advancement, energy intensity, reliance on fossil fuels, and environmental sustainability in 27 low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2021. This study employs a nonlinear STIRPAT framework alongside advanced econometric techniques, such as Driscoll–Kraay fixed-effects and Method-of-Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR), to reveal a U-shaped relationship between technological progress and CO₂ emissions. During the initial phases of industrial development, emissions typically increase; however, notable reductions in emissions are achieved as innovation progresses. The consumption of fossil fuels consistently increases emissions, whereas renewable energy and enhanced energy efficiency play a significant role in promoting sustainability. It is important to note that institutional quality exhibited varied or negligible impacts on environmental performance. The findings emphasize the importance of transitioning to clean energy and implementing innovation-focused policies that are customized to the emission profiles and developmental stages of individual countries. This study enhances the existing literature by providing detailed, distribution-sensitive insights into the environmental impacts of growth, technology, and governance in low- and middle-income countries. The findings present significant implications for environmental planning, green finance, and institutional reforms. Fostering clean innovation and reducing reliance on fossil fuels are essential for attaining sustainability objectives while ensuring development in resource-constrained economies is not hindered."}}

Pleas for the government to help by inflating the currency occurred immediately. Responses to the panic by President Grant and the New York Clearing House are discussed and shown, together, to have effectively mitigated the effects of the panic. The article then turns to Grant’s post-panic national financial actions; namely, his veto of the Currency (or Inflation) Bill of 1874 and his sponsorship of, and signature on, the Specie Resumption Act of 1875. Both actions, along with Grant’s reduction of the national debt in seven of the eight years of his presidency and quiet leadership approach, contrast sharply with modern national financial policies, practices and beliefs.

A novel class of covariance impulse response functions is introduced to trace the dynamic transmission of structural variance innovations in linear processes, with closed-form solutions. For estimation, we propose a quasi-maximum likelihood procedure that is easy to implement and consistent under weak conditions. We derive its asymptotic properties and demonstrate via extensive simulations the robustness of the estimator across a wide range of data-generating distributions. An empirical application to oil markets highlights the framework's practical relevance. We identify two distinct oil price shocks-each driving volatility in the spot and futures markets through different transmission mechanisms. The model yields new insights into the joint dynamics of oil prices and provides high-resolution historical decompositions around major geopolitical events."}}

Its subject is inter-firm relations. Corporate law, also called company law in some countries, governs how business organisations are formed and managed. In all its national variations, corporate law across jurisdictions commonly provides a set of legal attributes to business enterprises, such as legal personality and limited liability, that facilitate and encourage the conduct and organisation of business.&nbsp;These characteristic legal features single out corporations from other business organisations. At first glance, competition law and corporate law seem to operate within very distinct conceptual arenas. While competition law typically operates outside the boundaries of the firm, corporate law is concerned with the internal organisation of corporations. Competition law treats firms as units and discourages cooperation between them for the benefits that competition in the market brings. Corporate law, on the other hand, is very much about encouraging cooperation among corporate constituents for the organisation to work seamlessly and maximise value. While competition law's core purpose may be consumer welfare or more generally the protection of the competitive process for the benefit of consumers (sometimes along with different goals),&nbsp;corporate law may be regarded as traditionally centred on the protection of shareholders’ interests.&nbsp;Competition law may well be considered to have a public interest flavour, whereas corporate law is commonly structured to align and serve private interests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Beyond the surface, however, corporate law and competition law are closely intertwined fields.

Our unique dataset allows us to separately estimate effects on negative sentiment categories including anger, anxiety, and sadness. Our results suggest sentiment as one candidate mechanism, besides physiological and cognitive pathways, to explain the increasingly evident non-health damages from air pollution exposure on work productivity, road safety, sleep and crime."}}

Using proprietary parcel-level data from a major logistics firm, we find that a 10-percentage-point increase in tariffs raised monthly parcel volume by 3% in panel regressions and by 7% in long-difference specifications. These estimates imply that trade-war tariffs increased e-commerce imports by 5.3%–13.5%—substantial, yet modest compared to the spectacular overall ecommerce growth over 2017-2019. The response is stronger in more densely populated ZIP Codes but does not vary by income or race."}}

To investigate this difference, we first estimate a probit model of thrift failure over the housing bust and show that this difference holds even when controlling for local economic shocks and differences in thrift characteristics. Furthermore, we find that a concentration in construction and land development loans is the only type of loan concentration that is predictive of failure. Second, we calculate several measures of risk during the housing boom period and find that mutual thrifts increased their risk less than stock thrifts. We compare our results with earlier studies that examined thrifts during the savings and loan crisis. In our sample, thrifts supervised by the Office of Thrift Supervision failed at a higher rate than other thrifts.

This paper investigates the impact of expanded borrowing limits on business cycle dynamics through a two-pronged approach.

Second, we utilize a structural heterogeneous-agent dynamic stochastic general equilibrium framework that incorporates leveraged banks and occasionally binding collateral constraints to analyze the macroeconomic effects of shocks to credit limits. Our findings show that only the complete model, encompassing both financial intermediation and occasionally binding borrowing constraints, successfully replicates the empirically observed co-movement of output and consumption in response to shocks in borrowing limits. This underscores the crucial role of integrating these two elements for an accurate understanding of macroeconomic fluctuations."}}

The framework processes heterogeneous data from satellite imagery, UAV-mounted multispectral sensors, IoT soil monitoring networks, and weather stations to provide actionable insights for precision agriculture. Through 18 months of continuous field operations, we achieved 94.2% accuracy in crop health prediction, 87.3% precision in pest detection, and demonstrated 23% improvement in resource utilization efficiency compared to conventional methods. Our robotic platform successfully operated in challenging field conditions including varying weather patterns, diverse soil types, and multiple crop varieties across wheat, corn, soybean, and cotton fields. The system's interpretable AI components generated farmer-actionable recommendations that resulted in measurable improvements in crop yield and sustainability metrics."}}

The study assesses the benefits and drawbacks of blockchain-based asset storage using a mixed-method approach that consists of a literature review, and case studies. Legal recognition, data immutability, private key security, and user adoption in many regulatory environments are among the important issues discussed. According to the research, blockchain and NFT technologies present viable ways to improve transaction transparency, ownership verification, and asset security. Technical and legal issues, particularly those pertaining to interoperability and regulatory ambiguity, continue to be significant obstacles to widespread implementation, nonetheless. This study supports the incorporation of blockchain technology into actual asset management systems by offering empirical observations and useful suggestions."}}

LLM investor personas disagree in economically meaningful ways: political disagreement spikes around Presidential elections, income-based disagreement rises around tax cuts, and race-based disagreement increases around the George Floyd protests. Turning to market outcomes, LLM-derived disagreement correlates strongly with abnormal trading volume, and this relationship is not explained by existing high-frequency disagreement measures.

Far from being synonymous with laissez-faire, a commitment to formal equality provides a counterweight to the key neoliberal maxim that regulation of market economy should focus on efficiency alone.

The political changes and presentation of contemporary society in the five major novels of Ayi Kwei Armah- The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born, Fragments, Why Are We So Blest?, Two Thousand Seasons and The Healers constitute a chronological survey of society from colonialism to post colonialism. It is true that the chief characteristic of the postcolonial literatures is to go up against the colonizer’s supremacy. Each work of art in&nbsp; postcolonial literatures in some way or the other is concerned with its national culture. The important features of post colonial literature across the world are the issues like history and myth, language and landscape and other subject like education, population, poverty, employment, corruption and peace etc. The postcolonial writers used English language efficiently in their writing. Language is a result of culture and language is not just a medium for message but a transporter of culture also. Culture takes account of history, myth, rituals, morals and aesthetic values and it passed on generation to the other through language. The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born presents wrong means adopted by the corrupt politicians to remain in power. It shows the true picture of democracy which is corrupted at various levels by native people who are still under the influence of foreign culture after independence in the third world countries. The characters in The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born are stereotypes as Armah intends to satire post colonial society which witnesses’ political corruption under the democratic rule. All these events ultimately results in civil war. The tone of the novel is pessimistic but it ends with optimistic note."}}

This study evaluates the economic viability of household-based Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) systems in Mongla, a salinity-prone upazila in Bagerhat district. The primary objective is to assess whether investing in RWH infrastructure is a financially sound solution for households facing water scarcity and related health burdens. Using a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) framework, the study calculates key financial indicators including Net Present Value (NPV), Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period over a 20-year project lifespan. Real-world data from 100 RWH users and 100 non-users were collected through surveys, incorporating capital, operational, health, and time opportunity costs. Findings indicate that RWH adoption results in an NPV of 293938.6 BDT, a BCR of 20.9, and an IRR of 236.09%, with a payback period of less than one year. Additionally, RWH systems substantially reduce the time and medical costs associated with water collection and waterborne diseases. Sensitivity analyses confirm the system's resilience under fluctuating cost and benefit scenarios. These results strongly support RWH as a cost-effective and scalable solution to address drinking water insecurity in coastal Bangladesh. The study recommends policy integration of RWH into national water strategies, financial incentives for low-income households, and technical training for system maintenance to enhance community-level resilience and sustainable water access."}}

Using Norway’s invasive pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) as a case study, this study evaluates anglers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for management programs through contingent valuation (n=272). Advanced econometric models, including Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), Double-Hurdle Negative Binomial (DHNB), Heckman, and Two-Part Model (TWOPM), were employed to address zero-inflated and overdispersed data. Results reveal that 45% of anglers reported reduced fishing satisfaction due to pink salmon, driven by ecological concerns such as resource competition (73%) and disease spread (71%). The mean WTP was NOK 589 (€52), rising to NOK 1,952 (€175) among contributors. Key drivers of WTP included perceiving pink salmon as pests, angling frequency, and prior catch experience. Older anglers were less likely to contribute, while frequent anglers and those viewing pink salmon as pests were more likely to participate. Model comparisons identified ZINB and DHNB as the most effective for handling protest responses and overdispersion. These findings provide actionable insights for designing funding mechanisms, enhancing stakeholder engagement, and informing policy for invasive species management. The study also offers a transferable framework for valuing management interventions, balancing ecological risks with socioeconomic opportunities in environmental decision-making."}}

Theoretically, urbanization can impact the environment both in beneficial and harmful ways. On the one hand, it can increase energy demand, contributing to environmental harm. On the one hand, urban-driven economic growth often leads to increased energy consumption, which can exacerbate environmental degradation. On the other hand, urbanization has the potential to mitigate environmental harm by fostering agglomeration effects, economies of scale, improved education, technological innovation, and the development of sustainable infrastructure. Empirical studies on the relationship between urbanization and emissions present mixed results, consistent with the theory. To address heterogeneity in empirical studies, we performed a meta-analysis of 172 studies, generating 1,598 effect sizes. Our FAT-PET analysis indicates the presence of publication bias in previous research, but we do not find an overall significant effect of urbanization on emissions. However, when we disaggregated the studies conducted for different regions, we found that urbanization decreases emissions in Latin America, while it has no significant impact in Africa, Asia, and the West."}}

This study conducts a rigorous comparative evaluation of two leading ensemble learning algorithms, XGBoost and Random Forest, within the context of credit risk assessment. Utilizing the benchmark German Credit Data dataset, we implement a comprehensive methodological framework encompassing meticulous preprocessing, class imbalance mitigation via the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and systematic hyperparameter optimization using a 5-fold cross-validated GridSearchCV. The predictive efficacy of the models is benchmarked through stratified 10-fold cross-validated F1scores and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC). Critically, this research addresses a significant gap in the literature by moving beyond point-estimate comparisons to formally test for statistical significance using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and by dissecting model behavior through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for enhanced interpretability. Our findings reveal a nuanced performance landscape: while Random Forest exhibited a marginally higher mean F1-score, the Wilcoxon test yielded a p-value of 0.064, indicating no statistically significant difference in the models' predictive capabilities. Both models achieved high discriminative power with ROC-AUC scores exceeding 0.90. SHAP analysis confirmed the primacy of features like 'Duration' and 'Credit Amount' while also uncovering subtle distinctions in feature interaction between the models. This study concludes that XGBoost and Random Forest demonstrate functional equivalence in this application, suggesting that model selection for practitioners could be guided by secondary criteria such as computational overhead, scalability, and the specific demands for model transparency."}}

Since education institutions have embraced the use of technology to deliver learning services and student records, assessment information, learning resources, etc., may be hosted by third-party cloud service providers. It uncovers information to such threats as the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, data theft, and unauthorized access and other related risks. The HFABE algorithm responds to these challenges by incorporating a competent encryption approach, and safe key distribution. It entails creating private and public keys using a secure Key Escrow Agent and sending these keys directly to users' secure email accounts for validation and integrity with secure means. The solution that was proposed was in C# and benchmarked it with DES and RSA algorithms. The minor performance delay due to enhanced security measures and anti-DOS measure, HFABE showed better security than the other schemes. When it comes to encryption effectiveness, the HFABE method outperforms RSA and DES by almost 95% across all file sizes that were examined.

Accounting for measurement error, we find significant variation in gender bias and generosity across students. Furthermore, we uncover that bias varies systematically by gender and field of study and that patterns of sorting are sufficiently large to place female faculty at a substantive disadvantage in some fields and male faculty at a disadvantage in others. Finally, we document that sexist attitudes are predictive of gender-based sorting and propose Empirical Bayes inspired measures of student-level bias to correct for instructor-specific advantages and disadvantages caused by sorting."}}

We create a sample of 2,821 estimates from 42 studies and gather 59 aspects reflecting the context in which each estimate was obtained, including type of data, programme characteristics, student population, estimation method and publication quality, among others. We employ both linear and non-linear techniques to correct for publication bias, and we use Bayesian model averaging to study heterogeneous effects and address model uncertainty. The results are consistent with small publication bias - with the exception of studies devoted to analysing test scores, which appear more selective when reporting results. Once publication bias is accounted for, we find that school-meal programmes in high-income economies have minimal impact on students&apos; behaviour, health and education. Our heterogeneity analysis documents the fact that means-tested programmes and breakfast initiatives yield the greatest benefits for children&apos;s outcomes."}}

This study examines public perceptions of wealth deservingness and preferences for taxing the wealth of the rich, focusing on how opinions vary based on the amount, use, and origin of wealth. Drawing on an original vignette experiment conducted in Germany (n=6,018), our results show a consistent pattern: as wealth increases, its perceived deservingness declines, while support for taxation rises. Similarly, spending on luxury items is seen as less deserving than philanthropic or nonprofit investments, leading to greater support for taxing the wealth of luxury spending rich people. However, wealth obtained through inheritance presents a puzzling exception: although it is perceived as the least deserving compared to wealth gained through entrepreneurship or management, this does not translate into a stronger preference for taxing inheritors over managers. These findings, which hold across different income and wealth groups as well as political affiliations, highlight the complex and sometimes contradictory public attitudes toward the rich and the taxation of their wealth."}}

The simulation is done by modifying the model parameters based on interest rate-growth differentials historic data from 2004-2019. It is found that the fiscal consensus does not hold when implementing Blanchard's (2019) analysis with Indonesian-based rate parameters. Increasing public debt makes the economy more volatile and high risk. Modifying other factors supports the initial finding, with lower initial endowment diminishing the benefits of public debt and higher capital share under Cobb-Douglas. When the threat of debt explosion appears, efforts to reduce debt share will reduce the welfare of the society. The policy implication is to be careful of the opportunity; increasing public debt may not be the way to go, avoiding possible dire consequences."}}

To provide intuition for this result, we introduce a new decomposition of the effects of monetary policy on consumption across the wealth distribution. Second, we show that introducing heterogeneous households does not come at the cost of forecasting accuracy by comparing the performance of our model to its exact representative-agent counterpart and demonstrating nearly identical results in predicting key aggregate variables."}}

This paper empirically explores a parallel concept in banking: the marginal propensity to lend out of unsolicited deposit inflows (MPLD). Using county-level dividend payouts as an instrument for deposit inflows, I estimate the MPLD for U.S. banks and show that before QE, the average bank operated “hand-to-mouth” — it transformed approximately every dollar of deposit inflow into new loans, consistent with tight liquidity constraints. However, since then, the MPLD has dropped to 0.35. Moreover, the MPLD decreases in banks’ cash-to-asset ratio and deposit market power. The findings suggest that the QE-induced abundant reserves regime significantly relaxed liquidity constraints for the majority of banks, but did not eliminate them entirely."}}

Rather than modifying the underlying option pricing model, such as the Heston-Nandi GARCH or the Heston stochastic volatility framework, we introduce a local M-estimation approach that conditions on key state variables including VIX, realized volatility, and time. Our method reweights historical observations based on their relevance to current market conditions, using kernel functions with bandwidths selected via a validation procedure. This adaptive estimation improves the model’s responsiveness to evolving dynamics while maintaining tractability. Empirically, we show that local estimators substantially outperform traditional non-local approaches in forecasting near-term option implied volatilities. The improvements are particularly pronounced in low-volatility environments and across the cross-section of options. The local estimators also outperform the non-local estimators in explaining future option returns. Our findings suggest that local information, when properly incorporated into the estimation process, can enhance the accuracy and robustness of option pricing models."}}

The term came to existence to highlight a recent financial phenomenon with potentially significant competitive implications: a small group of large and diversified institutional investors increasingly have parallel minority investment positions in many publicly listed companies, not only across the economy but also within one and the same industry. ‘Horizontal shareholding’ is an alternative term used to describe this phenomenon when common shareholdings are held in horizontal competitors specifically (Elhauge 2016). Common ownership by minority financial investors can be situated in the broader context of the theory of mergers and acquisitions. It is the latest manifestation of the manifold ways that rival industrial firms may come under common ownership and control: suggesting that, besides full mergers and controlling partial acquisitions, standalone non-controlling partial acquisitions may also give rise to significant antitrust concerns (Tzanaki 2022). Interestingly, common ownership may also produce efficiencies under certain circumstances. Yet, the extent to which merger control rules may capture and remedy common minority shareholdings is neither comprehensive nor uniform across jurisdictions.</span></p>"}}

While working from home, the company begins a performance evaluation on a new weight. Watch out for phoney websites that purport to provide jobs that can be done from home. Prospective employees worldwide can work remotely without worrying about obtaining a passport or visa. Software as a Service emerges as a new market to provide businesses with all services provided while working from home. To set up a home office, most employees spend money on furniture, with most of them spending RS 10,000 on furnishings. Working from home increases internet bills by Rs. 1000. We accepted technological innovation when we adopted the work-from-home paradigm. Employees with higher technological expertise are valued more highly than those with experience.

We sought to quantify the impact of GLP-1 use on coronary stent use among Medicare patients.Methods: We analyzed claims data for a 5% random sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2016 (n=1,847,213). Risk of CV events was derived using the REGARDS study CV risk algorithm. The unadjusted association between CV event risk and observed stent use (2017–2021) was modeled with a flexible linear spline. The impact of GLP-1 use on patients’ 5-year risk of stent use was calculated by applying SELECT estimates of coronary revascularization reduction (HR 0.77 95% CI 0.68–0.87) to patients’ CV event risk. We projected the impact on 5-year stent use as GLP-1 use increased from 0% to 100% under 4 CV risk-based adoption scenarios: highest risk first; lowest risk first; median risk patients first (base case); and random adoption.Results: Sixty percent adoption of GLP-1 by median CV risk patients first would reduce coronary stent use overall by 6.9% (95% CI 3.6%–9.8%).  The impact varied with the role of CV risk in GLP-1 adoption. Sixty percent use in the highest CV risk patients first resulted in a 21.5% (95% CI 14.3%–25.8%) reduction as opposed to 5.9% (95% CI 3.3%–8.3%) when driven by the population with 60% lowest CV risk.Conclusions: Widespread GLP-1 use among Medicare beneficiaries may reduce coronary stent use by as much as 21.5%, with attendant implications for physicians, hospitals, and manufacturers."}}

With heightened awareness and better data, we expect incentivized banks to expand transparency, adjust lending standards, and reduce their loan exposure to climate risks. Focusing on the 230 largest European banks from 2017 to 2022, we find that participants in supervisory climate stress tests significantly increase their transparency, mainly if they have previously shown commitment to climate issues, face outside ESG pressure, or are more exposed to climate risks. Corporate borrowers of such committed banks reduce their total and long-term loan financing and, in turn, display lower (fixed) assets and sales growth, but only if they are subject to high climate transition risks. In terms of aggregate loan portfolios, we find a shift from long-term to short-term maturities for committed banks but the opposite for the remaining stress-tested banks. The former also increase their climate performance along various dimensions. Our results suggest that, while on average we find no effects, supervisory stress tests can act as change agents and elicit feedback effects for banks facing strong climate-related incentives, impose funding and investment constraints on high-risk borrowers, but also trigger (unintended) substitution to less committed and less tightly regulated banks."}}

This process marked by growing socioeconomic , political, and technological transformations requires us to reconsider how we adapt to the emerging global order described as deglobalization by Walden Bello (2004 and 2007). In this research, we propose a new tool called the Desglobalization Index (Ð-Index) to quantify and analyse this transition. The accelerating pace of deglobalization is shaped, in part, by recent U.S. economic and military policies. On the economic front, this includes the implementation of protectionist trade measures (such as tariffs), anti-immigration policies (including the detention and repatriation of undocumented migrants), tax reforms (primarily tax cuts), and revised monetary strategies (such as interest rate reductions). These policies are largely a response to the rise of China as a major global competitor increasingly positioned to challenge U.S. leadership in the global economy. Such measures clearly contradict the core principles of globalization. Furthermore, U.S. military strategies such as the sale of advanced weapons and anti-air defence systems to Europe (in relation to the Russia-Ukraine conflict) and the Middle East (involving the Israel-Hamas-Iran conflict) further contribute to the rapid acceleration of a large-scale deglobalization process. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to quantify and measure the deglobalization process to better understand the ongoing global transition from globalization to deglobalization. To this end, we introduce the Desglobalization Index (Ð-Index) as a new and original analytical tool."}}

Building on earlier Australia-New Zealand comparisons, I examined six highincome countries (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK, Ireland, USA) to identify how regulatory, cultural, systemic, legal, economic, and service-delivery factors shape open disclosure policy and practice. <b>Methods: </b>I performed a qualitative comparative policy analysis of national legislation, guidelines, and implementation reports published through December 2024 across the six jurisdictions. Data extraction captured policy objectives, governance structures, legal mandates, economic incentives, and implementation strategies. Nine theoretical frameworks-including Institutional Theory, Policy Diffusion, Implementation Science, and Cultural Competence-guided thematic coding. I then integrated country-specific findings to identify cross-jurisdictional patterns, interrelationships, and trade-offs. <b>Results: </b>Approaches ranged from Australia's standards-based governance model to New Zealand's legally mandated framework. Canada, the UK, Ireland, and the USA exhibited varied combinations of statutory duties, apology laws, accreditation requirements, and communication-and-resolution programs. Key differences emerged in legal enforceability, definitions of harm, enforcement mechanisms, equity considerations, and economic incentives. Cultural competence provisions varied markedly, with New Zealand demonstrating the most comprehensive Indigenous rights integration. Common challenges included resource constraints, medico-legal concerns, and inconsistent implementation, while strong clinical leadership and feedback mechanisms were identified as facilitators of effective open disclosure. <b>Conclusions: </b>A hybrid model-integrating clear legal mandates for serious incidents, explicit apology protections, accreditation linked to quality outcomes, cultural competence provisions, and transparent economic assessments could enhance open disclosure effectiveness worldwide (Figure 2). Policymakers and healthcare leaders can use these insights to foster trust, learning, and accountability in diverse contexts. Future empirical evaluation of such hybrid frameworks is needed to assess implementation feasibility and impacts on patient safety outcomes."}}

The direct and spillover effects on expectations and actions are significant and of comparable magnitude. Higher expected future real GDP growth increases prices and employment, while greater uncertainty about it reduces prices, investment, and employment. We show that spillover effects on the connected firms' expectations are driven by inter-firm communication, as opposed to observable actions. This matters as we find communication to be symmetric upstream vs downstream, while propagation via actions is asymmetric. We embed inter-firm communication along the supply chain in a New Keynesian pricing problem and discuss implications for the transmission of aggregate uncertainty to prices and inflation."}}

Under the new rules, banks must either recognize all fair value changes in the profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement or exclude them entirely. The reform sparked political controversy grounded in the academic debate about the impact of accounting standards on real investments by firms. While standard-setters aimed to curtail incentives for gains trading and opportunistic earnings management, critics argued that the lack of recycling would discourage long-term equity holdings, harming sustainable investment. Using global data on IFRS 9 adoption by banks, this study examines whether and how the rules for gains realization impact banks' equity investments. We present three main findings. First, banks' equity investments did decline overall, particularly those previously classified as fair value through OCI. Second, the decline was most pronounced among banks with a record of gains trading and earnings management, and for instruments most suited to these practices. Third, banks' long-term equity investments shrank barely, if at all. Overall, our findings suggest that rules on the realization of unrealized gains matter for banks' investment decisions. However, the investment change is attributable to equity securities that were primarily used for gains trading and not held for strategic long-term objectives. This latter purported outcome rather served as a convenient political excuse to oppose accounting rules that constrain opportunistic earnings management."}}

Through a doctrinal and comparative lens, the paper traces the evolution of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence-from property-based trespass doctrine to the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" standard in Katz v. United States 3 , and beyond to Carpenter v. United States 4 , where the Supreme Court signaled a growing sensitivity to digital-era intrusions. Drawing on case law, federal and state statutory frameworks, and recent municipal reforms 5 , the paper argues that existing Fourth Amendment doctrine is ill-equipped to address the passive, persistent, and pervasive nature of facial surveillance. Ultimately, it concludes that a doctrinal recalibration-whether judicial, legislative, or both-is urgently needed to align biometric surveillance with constitutional values of privacy, proportionality, and accountability."}}

The research provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to congestion in the area. A quantitative survey research design was used to collect data through an online survey administered between January and February 2023. A survey instrument adapted from relevant literature was used to collect demographic information about respondents and identify patterns of traffic congestion on both road networks. A total of 1,483, completed responses were obtained and analysed using descriptive statistics. The findings indicate that recurring congestion, primarily influenced by poor roadway conditions, lack of lanes, bottlenecks, and inefficient traffic management, accounts for 52.40% of the congestion. Non-recurring congestion, attributed to poor weather conditions, new development projects, festivals, and accidents, contributes to 47.60% of the congestion. The analysis further highlights the most congested roads during peak hours, with the Sulaman &gt; KKIP Sepanggar &gt; UMS route being the most problematic, followed by the Jalan Tuaran Bypass route. These routes experience heavy traffic due to their significance as major arteries connecting key areas, as well as the presence of construction work, narrow road width, and limited public transportation options. Addressing congestion in the Tuaran Bypass and Sulaman KKIP road networks requires prioritizing improvements in roadway conditions, increasing the number of lanes, optimizing traffic management, enhancing signaling systems, and effectively managing weather-related disruptions and new development projects. By implementing targeted strategies, it is possible to alleviate recurring congestion and mitigate non-recurring congestion, ultimately improving traffic flow and mobility in the area."}}

For example, the EU reform targets Temu and Shein, who have been argued not to \"play on a level playing field\" in terms of labour.

Firms now actively choose between on-site work (WOS), fully remote work (WFH), and hybrid work arrangements. Using a three-layer principal-agent model, we analyze how employers determine the optimal working mode under proper incentive mechanisms. The results suggest that if the probability of converting effort into output is high enough—such that employees decide to work harder on their own, even without direct (on-site) supervision, to maximize their wages—then WFH becomes optimal. Factors such as employee talent, education, experience, or the simplicity of a task could serve as proxies for a higher conversion probability, thereby raising the likelihood that effort translates into high output. In this manner, if an employee is talented, more educated, and more experienced, or the task is relatively simple, they are more likely to be offered remote positions. Conversely, if the task is complicated and the agent lacks sufficient hands-on experience, they may choose not to exert effort, knowing that their effort is unlikely to yield adequate compensation given the low probability of success. Therefore, jobs with a higher likelihood of success and experienced workers should be given the choice to work from home under the appropriate incentive structures."}}

Allowing the benevolent government to jointly optimize consumption taxes on 11 different consumption categories and labor income taxes, I find that necessities should be heavily subsidized (-52%) and that luxuries are optimally taxed at a positive rate of 7%. This increase in the rate differential is optimally compensated by a significant decrease in the progressivity of the labor income tax. Three main mechanisms explain why such differentiated tax rates are welfare maximizing: they provide consumption insurance by subsidizing essential goods of low-income households, imply a targeted taxation of the initial wealth of high-wealth households, and induce highly productive households to increase their labor supply."}}

Using novel quarterly-level data of receivable balances with major customers, I analyze trade credit outcomes at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for firms' public, private, and government buyers. While upstream firms extended credit terms toward all customers on average, this aggregation masks considerable cross-sectional variation: Credit extensions overwhelmingly went to large, publicly traded customers with presumably better access to capital. Firms extended terms with these customers by around 20 days, while privately held customers experienced a contraction of credit days of similar magnitude. Cross-sectional tests reveal suppliers consistently extended more credit to customers with better product market position and lower risk. The pattern is not driven by customer financial constraints or variation in downstream demand shocks. Instead, suppliers strategically extended credit to customers with greater downstream stability, resulting in subsequent sales growth, better customer retention, and higher profit margins."}}

Two systems for the monitoring and control of projects, Earned Value Management and Earned Schedule, are available. We model these systems and develop algorithms to minimize the expected total cost of a project under task time and cost uncertainty. This enables us to make structural comparisons between the optimal expediting decisions and expected costs of the two systems. This in turn reveals that the time profile of project workload is an important factor in the relative costs of the two systems. An extensive computational study validates these theoretical results, and shows that the expected loss from choosing the wrong monitoring and control system is typically significant. Our work provides theoretical support for the empirical performance of the two systems. We thus provide project managers with a theoretically justified, simple, and effective way to choose the best monitoring and control system at the start of a project, based on project characteristics that are generally known."}}

But existing theories for understanding organizational change generally focus on change within a single organization. This perspective misses important interconnectivity and dependencies that organizations have with other entities that both facilitate and impede organizational change. We explore these critical interconnectivities and dependencies and propose an Organizational Ecosystem Change Model (OECM) that considers how organizational change occurs within an ecosystem of organizations. We illustrate the relevance of this model by applying it to an organization's attempt to change in response to complex sustainability challenges that require the federal ecosystem of organizations to incorporate energy and environmental justice values into their work. Through interviews and analyzing official agency documents and internal archival documents with OECM, we demonstrate that organization change is (1) affected by the nature of hierarchy within the ecosystem, (2) requires significant coordination across the ecosystem, and (3) warrants codifying new organizational norms and processes that can create ecosystem-wide support for change. OECM model and our empirical application advance our understanding of organizational change theory and offer practical insights for organizational ecosystems dealing with similar change-related tasks to address complex sustainability challenges."}}

At the same time, concerns about greenwashing have risen as well, potentially undermining investor confidence, harming market integrity, and slowing down the transition to a sustainable economy.</p>\n<p>According to ESMA, identifying greenwashing cases could be challenging due to misleading financial disclosure or omission of information. Indeed, sustainability claims could suffer from absence of substantial backing or evidence, cheap talk, inconsistency (<i>i.e.</i>, mismatch between the company’s sustainability claims and its actual practices), cherry-picking, complexity and lack of transparency. In addition, market pressure due to consumer demands or investor expectations could lead companies to overstate their environmental credentials and expertise. Lastly, the absence of a specific and unique regulation on this topic at both national and EU levels could undermine greenwashing detection as well. Similarly, academic literature underlines various but somewhat interrelated interpretations of greenwashing such as ‘selective disclosure’, ‘unsubstantiated or misleading claims’, ‘gap between environmental information disclosed and actual environmental performance’ and ‘overly positive beliefs about an organization’s environmental performance’. All these definitions refer to firms manipulating communication with the aim of creating a favourable, social and eco-friendly company image.</p>\n<p><span>The aim of our research is to develop a first prototype that should be grounded in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which could support supervision activity by providing alerts for potential cases of greenwashing (</span><i>i.e.</i><span>, greenwashing alert system). Financial authorities increasingly recognize the need for supervisory technology tools (SupTech) to enhance their oversight capabilities. SupTech leverages advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning (ML) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory supervision. These tools enable authorities to quickly process vast amounts of data, potentially identifying risks early, and supporting compliance with regulatory standards.</span></p>\n<p>The developed prototype relies on large language models such as ClimateBERT and ESGBERT, combined with a proprietary dictionary that maps a defined set of keywords to each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), based on the alignment of the Green Bond Principles (GBP) with the SDG framework. First, the prototype can identify environmental phrases and environmental claims in selected documents such as sustainability reports, tagging them accordingly as ‘environmental’ or ‘environmental claim’. Second, the prototype highlights the sentiment of statements and classifies them into three categories: risk, opportunity, or neutral, depending on the tone of the content. Third, the prototype performs a dictionary-based search to extract SDG-related phrases, assigns them to the corresponding SDG and then computes <a rel=\"nofollow\">an SDG </a>mismatch measure that quantifies discrepancies between the declared and the detected SDGs. The overall system provides structured insights that can support regulatory and supervisory efforts. By automating these processes, the prototype can significantly reduce the time which analysts need to manually review sustainability reports and mitigate potential biases that can arise from subjective interpretation. This systematic approach could not only improve efficiency but also strengthen the reliability and transparency of analyses. The prototype has not yet been fully validated and tested, primarily due to the limited number of confirmed greenwashing cases; nonetheless, it shows potential for future implementation as a greenwashing alert system.</p>"}}

Using stock market reactions to earnings announcements, we document that hard-to-value stocks are associated with a more pronounced S-shaped response pattern around category thresholds.

These mental health gains are accompanied by higher partner employment and increased separation rates, suggesting that reskilling frees partners from costly relationship commitments. Together, the mental health and partner benefits add 83% to the direct labor earnings gains from reskilling."}}

SeenItRet strongly forecasts future market-wide stock returns up to two years ahead, with an annualized impact of 4-7% for a one standard deviation shift. Our framework is general and also predicts real economic outcomes, including recessions, inflation, and patenting activity. A virtue of our approach is its use of economic principles to reduce the high dimensionality of the underlying state space to an ex-ante measurable and intuitive unidimensional predictor.

In particular, this form of epistemic injustice arises when someone's knowledge can no longer be justifiably relied upon for actions that benefit the community. Drawing on a neo-republican approach, I frame the normative character of this injustice in terms of the undesirable dependence of an epistemic agent's contributive capacity on the benevolence of their listeners. I argue that this may occur as a consequence of implementing new decisionsupport technologies based on artificial intelligence (AI), drawing on a hypothetical scenario from the agricultural sector. In this scenario, AI-based predictive systems prove more reliable than workers' expertise in data analysis and decision-making. Under these circumstances, practitioners are not prevented from operating, but rather from contributing to the common good as knowers and by virtue of their epistemic capacity. This exclusion manifests through the formation of what I term 'epistemic culs-de-sac', referring to a body of knowledge that is marginalised for lacking robust empirical evidence to justify its use in broader epistemic or practical contexts."}}

Yet, the issue of how new technology itself affects financial innovation activity is not well understood. We argue that, although new technologies can spur financial innovation via knowledge spillovers, they can also lead to the \"crowding out\" of financial innovation by increasing the relative profitability of competing investment opportunities. To test our hypotheses, we use time-series data during 2005-2019 on the occurrence of major waves of non-financial innovation and their impact on firms' financial patenting and the hiring of financial inventors. We find evidence of aggregate-level crowding-out in the earlier part of the sample: firms tend to shift from financial to non-financial patenting following the onset of an innovation wave. A likely driver of this substitution effect is a relative labor demand shift away from financial inventors and toward non-financial inventors. This demand shift appears to be stronger among firms with fewer financial or real constraints and those with better access to local inventor human capital. In more recent years, substitution effects have diminished, likely due to the increasing breadth and attractiveness of financial patenting. Overall, our results shed light on the economic trade-offs that drive financial innovation and suggest that the growing integration of finance with non-financial technology has increasingly blurred the lines between different innovation types."}}

This study advances the literature by developing a novel mixed-strategy equilibrium framework that integrates capital market frictions, long overlooked in traditional finance models, with heterogeneous lenders' screening abilities. Departing from Modigliani-Miller's frictionless paradigm and pure-strategy competition, we model how structural asymmetries in screening ability (enhanced for FinTechs post-open banking) and funding costs (lower for deposit-funded banks) interact to determine credit market outcomes. Our analysis reveals that the lender incurring lower losses from high-risk borrowers captures full market profits. While open banking enhances loan efficiency by directing capital toward safer borrowers, it simultaneously reduces borrower surplus through intensified market concentration, potentially lowering social welfare. Crucially, we identify FinTech's friction-adjusted capital costs as an effective regulatory lever only when FinTechs dominate post-open banking, curbing monopoly rents without harming borrowers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of symmetric credit strategies over asymmetric ones in zero-profit equilibria, maximizing welfare when both lenders break even. These findings bridge operations management insights on resource-constrained competition with core finance theories, offering policymakers context-specific tools to balance innovation, stability, and consumer welfare across diverse regulatory environments."}}

Its ability to combine real-time interaction, entertainment value, and time-limited promotions has introduced a new dimension to online retail strategy. However, these same features also stimulate impulsive consumer behavior, which complicates pricing decisions, supply chain coordination, and profitability management. This study examines the strategic implications of impulsive buying behavior in a dual-channel supply chain comprising a manufacturer, a retailer, and two consumer segments: rational and impulsive. Specifically, we develop a game-theoretic model that captures consumer heterogeneity, channel pricing structures, and the value-added effects of live streaming. The model compares the wholesale price and marketplace models under varying degrees of impulsiveness, commission rates, and content quality. Our results yield several counterintuitive insights. First, stronger impulsive behavior does not always enhance profitsit may reduce them due to intensified channel interactions and demand volatility. Second, livestreaming prices may exceed those of ordinary online channels, reflecting the value-added content and behavioral biases associated with live streaming. Third, the wholesale price model may outperform the marketplace model when commission rates and impulsive tendencies are high, as it grants retailers greater pricing autonomy. Finally, rational consumers, often overlooked in promotional strategies, can act as a stabilizing force, helping mitigate channel conflict and restore profitability. These findings suggest several actionable strategies: retailers should avoid over-relying on impulsive demand and instead maintain pricing discipline across channels to reduce cannibalization."}}

The Supreme Court has tightened administrative law controls on agency power, and the Trump administration has stormed the bureaucracy in an unprecedented blitz designed to kneecap agency capacity and independence. For better or worse, many agencies and their civil servants are being sidelined as meaningful actors in the administration of government. Yet, this familiar account doesn't tell the entire story. At the same time that agencies are being stripped of the power to implement law-what this article calls \"legal administration\"-they are steadily accumulating extensive and largely unchecked powers to leverage information and communication to pursue controversial policy goals-what this article calls \"informational administration.\"&nbsp; \n<br>\n<br>\nWhile these powers are not new, they are becoming more potent as they are amplified by modern communication technologies and as their lack of legal encumbrance makes them into attractive policymaking tools for partisan overseers of the administrative state. As a result of these trends, which this article documents, informational administration stands poised to become both more of a focal point for real-world administrative action and more of a site for significant contestation over administrative power. Already, the last two presidential administrations have aggressively used informational administration to pursue policy goals that might prove beyond agencies' power in the more traditional domain of legal administration-for instance, using social media to fight pandemic misinformation or running nationally televised commercials to encourage self-deportation. Responding to these episodes, courts have begun to improvise in the administrative law vacuum that surrounds informational administration, seeking to curtail through legal means what used to be constrained largely by informal norms.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\nThese developments have the potential to change not only the degree of power wielded by the administrative state, but also the very nature of that power. This article seeks to draw greater scholarly attention to the problem by systematically charting the domain of informational administration, showing how it is mostly exempted from traditional administrative law constraints, explaining why it is poised to become more important and contested in a highly politically polarized information society, and venturing preliminary answers to questions about how informational administration might be both harnessed to accomplish goals that agencies are no longer able to accomplish through legal administration and regulated so as to prevent populist authoritarian cooptation. At its best, informational administration could be part of a resurgent administrative democracy in a time of informational and democratic crisis; at its worst it could be an instrument of democratic backsliding. Prevailing trends toward executive&nbsp;<span><span>power over administrative agencies make the latter far more likely, but in reality the present moment is an inflection point, and either future is possible. Which one prevails will be determined in part by how administrative law responds to the rise of informational administration.</span></span><span></span>"}}

Although technical obstacles are often blamed, key challenges may instead stem from organizational management. Through a simple principal-agent model centered on workforce digitalization, we demonstrate that without corresponding adjustments in compensation incentives, digital transformation fails to enhance labor productivity. In other words, compensation incentives play a pivotal moderating role in translating digital transformation into productivity gains. This insight is supported by a series of robust empirical analyses, leveraging a workforce digitalization index constructed via large language models and financial data from over 3,000 Chinese firms and 5,000 U.S. firms from WRDS and CSMAR. Our study challenges a prevalent managerial intuition that the success of automation is primarily driven by cost-cutting, by showing that such success of workforce digitalization does not, and should not, stem from reducing compensation cost. To facilitate more effective collaboration of human labor and digital technologies, organizations must ensure that employees perceive tangible benefits from the transformation."}}

Thereafter, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to determine the number of components needed to explain 95% of the variance and quantify dimensionality reduction. To further enhance the structural analysis, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-inspired approach extracts temporal patterns that improve noise detection and filtering capabilities.

The dataset combines quarterly financial reports with country-level indicators from Euromonitor International and Trading Economics. Special attention is given to systemic events such as the Arab Spring, currency devaluations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that Egyptian banks demonstrated relative resilience to these shocks. Capitalization positively influences ROA but negatively affects ROE, reflecting a leveragerelated trade-off. Liquidity risk, operational inefficiency, and weak financial structure are associated with lower profitability, while bank size and interest rates contribute positively. Macroeconomic variables-credit risk, inflation, economic growth, and money supply expansion-also significantly affect profitability. The findings highlight the dominant role of intra-bank factors over external conditions and offer policy insights for enhancing financial stability in emerging banking sectors."}}

Agencies increasingly rely on algorithmic systems to determine access to public benefits, assess risk, allocate resources, and inform enforcement. Often without sufficient transparency or oversight. When the government makes consequential decisions using AI tools, the basic constitutional requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard do not disappear. On the contrary, the use of automated decisionmaking raises the stakes: the risk of error, opacity, and institutional bias can be amplified when poorly designed or inadequately monitored systems are deployed.</p>\n<p>This paper argues that procedural due process must be enforced at both the design and implementation stages of government AI use. To that end, it proposes a regulatory framework grounded in three pillars: interpretability, auditability, and institutional accountability. Government agencies should not be permitted to shield decisions behind “black box” systems. Instead, due process requires systems to be interpretable to affected individuals and courts, subject to regular audits, and overseen by agency leadership with performance incentives tied to transparency and fairness.</p>\n<p>A risk-based oversight model, similar to the tiered approach of the EU AI Act, can help allocate compliance burdens in proportion to the potential harms of the system in use. This model preserves innovation while protecting constitutional rights. Although federal guidance remains fragmented, courts and lawmakers are beginning to recognize that meaningful due process cannot coexist with inscrutable or untested algorithms. Algorithmic accountability is a constitutional requirement.</p>"}}

These different \"crowd paradigms\" are grounded in different value creation logics and tend to involve different tasks for crowd members, offering different paths for human-AI interactions. While AI can automate the tasks of crowd members in some cases, it is more likely to augment human contributions or improve the management of crowds in others. In addition to thinking about how AI will impact crowd members and their tasks, however, we also move to crowd-level analysis to consider what it would mean for AI to challenge the different value creation logics of crowdsourcing in the first place. We hope that this essay will guide future research on crowds and AI, while also offering a fresh perspective for scholars thinking about the impact of AI on organizations more generally."}}

While widely used for its simplicity and modularity, PTO can lead to suboptimal decisions because the estimation step does not account for the structure of the downstream optimization problem. We study a class of problems where the objective function, evaluated at the PTO decision, is asymmetric with respect to estimation errors. This asymmetry causes the expected outcome to be systematically degraded by noise in the parameter estimate, as the penalty for underestimation differs from that of overestimation. To address this, we develop a data-driven post-estimation adjustment that improves decision quality while preserving the practicality and modularity of PTO. We show that when the objective function satisfies a particular curvature condition, based on the ratio of its third and second derivatives, the adjustment simplifies to a closed-form expression. This condition holds for a broad range of pricing problems, including those with linear, log-linear, and power-law demand models. Under this condition, we establish theoretical guarantees that our adjustment uniformly and asymptotically outperforms standard PTO, and we precisely characterize the resulting improvement. Additionally, we extend our framework to multi-parameter optimization and settings with biased estimators. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves revenue, particularly in small-sample regimes where estimation uncertainty is most pronounced. This makes our approach especially well-suited for pricing new products or in settings with limited historical price variation."}}

The accumulated literature has been systematically reviewed and organized to elucidate how second-degree price discrimination may be applied according to the nature of the relationships among the products offered-specifically, whether they are horizontally differentiated and substitutable, or vertically differentiated and substitutable, or complementary. Systematizing these accumulated research findings can broaden the range of practical pricing options available to companies. To ensure these ideas can be applied at the practical level of business operations, this paper has deliberately omitted the formulas and presented the concept of the sales method."}}
