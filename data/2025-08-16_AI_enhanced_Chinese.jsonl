It compares the two approaches of responsive web design (RWD) and adaptive web design (AWD) as to their origins, techniques, performance implications, accessibility considerations, and practicality of different forms of operation. The article identifies such design patterns (fluid grids, flexible images, media queries, device-aware content), the impacts of the frameworks in use (Bootstrap and other libraries), testing and UX evaluation challenges, and SEO considerations based on Marcotte (2010), Nielsen Norman Group reports, systematic review sources, and several empirical studies. The review identifies some gaps in cross-device testing, content personalization strategies, and standardized evaluation metrics and proposes future research directions in this regard, including unified benchmarks and accessibility-centric AWD/RWD evaluation.

By integrating local retail infrastructure with real-time logistics, HDS influence not only delivery operations but also has the potential to shape household consumption patterns. This study examines how HDS reshape shopping behavior and assesses their economic and environmental consequences. Leveraging a unique household-level panel dataset covering all offline retailers and product categories, and applying a difference-in-differences framework with propensity score matching, we estimate the causal effects of HDS adoption. We find that HDS increase both overall and offline spending and shopping frequency, while reducing average order size, suggesting a shift toward smaller, more frequent purchases. Contrary to the conventional \"substitution\" hypothesis, HDS complement rather than replace in-person shopping. To unpack this complementarity, we evaluate changes not only in shopping volume but also in cross-channel structure. Mechanism analysis shows the strongest effects among time-constrained households who reallocate saved time toward higher-order discretionary consumption, supporting theories of utility maximization and hierarchical consumer needs. The breadth of our data enables a more balanced view of HDS's externalities: while adoption boosts household demand and local economic engagement, it may also generate environmental rebound effects. These findings underscore how digitally coordinated retail platforms like HDS operate not only as logistical tools but also as socio-technical systems that reconfigure consumer time use, decision structures, and retail engagement at scale."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u914d\u9001\u670d\u52a1\uff08HDS\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u6539\u53d8\u8d2d\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0HDS\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6d88\u8d39\u9891\u7387\u548c\u603b\u652f\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5355\u6b21\u8ba2\u5355\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u7ebf\u4e0b\u8d2d\u7269\u5f62\u6210\u4e92\u8865\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u5bb6\u5ead\u53d7\u76ca\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u5f39\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "research_question": "HDS\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u8d2d\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ea7\u751f\u4f55\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "HDS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u914d\u9001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bb6\u5ead\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u9700\u6c42\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5bb6\u5ead\u5c42\u9762\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u548c\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1HDS\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "findings": "HDS\u589e\u52a0\u6d88\u8d39\u9891\u7387\u548c\u603b\u652f\u51fa\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5355\u6b21\u8ba2\u5355\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ebf\u4e0b\u8d2d\u7269\u4e92\u8865\uff1b\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u5bb6\u5ead\u53d7\u76ca\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u5f39\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HDS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86HDS\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, their adaptive autonomy and inter-agent coupling create systemic risks, such as goal drift, cascading errors, opaque decision logic, and responsibility gaps, that traditional governance cannot effectively address.This study develops the Agent Governance Playbook, a practice-oriented framework designed to enable organisations to capture the strategic benefits of autonomous AI agents while mitigating associated risks. Built on the Autonomy\u2013Coupling Risk Quadrant (ACRQ) Framework, the Playbook translates governance principles into actionable modules, measurable KPIs, and tailored escalation protocols. It provides managers with tools to detect early warning signals, align agent behaviour with strategic objectives, and integrate governance into design, deployment, and operations, reducing the need for costly retrofits.Key findings show that effective governance must be proactive, embedded within the agent architecture, and sensitive to the specific autonomy\u2013coupling profile of each system. The proposed KPIs, such as Alignment Drift Index and Cross-Agent Conflict Rate, offer measurable indicators for quadrant migration and governance erosion.By bridging conceptual governance models with operational practices, this work reframes governance as a strategic enabler rather than a constraint. It offers both academics and practitioners a roadmap for embedding trust, compliance, and resilience into AI-driven e-business ecosystems, ensuring that autonomous agents remain lasting assets instead of unmanaged liabilities."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u300aAgent Governance Playbook\u300b\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8eAutonomy\u2013Coupling Risk Quadrant (ACRQ) Framework\uff0c\u5c06\u6cbb\u7406\u539f\u5219\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684KPIs\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027-\u8026\u5408\u7279\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff1f", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u7ea7\u8054\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u7f3a\u53e3\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eAutonomy\u2013Coupling Risk Quadrant (ACRQ) Framework\uff0c\u5c06\u6cbb\u7406\u539f\u5219\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u300aAgent Governance Playbook\u300b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684KPIs\uff08\u5982Alignment Drift Index\u548cCross-Agent Conflict Rate\uff09\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "findings": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027-\u8026\u5408\u7279\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684KPIs\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u8c61\u9650\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u4fb5\u8680\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u6cbb\u7406\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u52a8\u8005\u800c\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6cbb\u7406\u878d\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u540e\u671f\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

It compares the two approaches of responsive web design (RWD) and adaptive web design (AWD) as to their origins, techniques, performance implications, accessibility considerations, and practicality of different forms of operation. The article identifies such design patterns (fluid grids, flexible images, media queries, device-aware content), the impacts of the frameworks in use (Bootstrap and other libraries), testing and UX evaluation challenges, and SEO considerations based on Marcotte (2010), Nielsen Norman Group reports, systematic review sources, and several empirical studies. The review identifies some gaps in cross-device testing, content personalization strategies, and standardized evaluation metrics and proposes future research directions in this regard, including unified benchmarks and accessibility-centric AWD/RWD evaluation. Practitioners might draw from these insights in choosing design strategies that match performance, maintainability, and user experience objectives."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u9875\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08AWD\uff09\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7f51\u9875\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08RWD\uff09\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3001\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u53ca\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "research_question": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u9875\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08AWD\uff09\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7f51\u9875\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08RWD\uff09\u5728\u8d77\u6e90\u3001\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u53ca\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f55\u5f02\u540c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u6d4f\u89c8\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u7406\u89e3AWD\u548cRWD\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u8df5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eMarcotte\uff082010\uff09\u3001Nielsen Norman Group\u62a5\u544a\u53ca\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AWD\u548cRWD\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6d41\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u3001\u5a92\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\uff09\u53ca\u6846\u67b6\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83AWD\u548cRWD\u3002", "findings": "AWD\u548cRWD\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u4ee5\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AWD/RWD\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Based on a novel measure of firm-level skilled labor mobility, we identify that skilled labor mobility exposed to climate disasters leads to increased liquidity buffers whereas routine-task labor does not. Additionally, firms with skilled labor mobility exposed to frequent climate disasters experience a decrease in sales growth and market shares, while firms with more routine-task labor remain unaffected. Furthermore, state-level climate adaptation policies can mitigate the adverse effects of climate disasters. Overall, the findings suggest that skilled labor mobility increases the cost of labor adjustment induced by climate change, but adaptation actions promote resilience to the challenges caused by labor market frictions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7f13\u51b2\uff0c\u800c\u5e38\u89c4\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5219\u65e0\u6b64\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u6c14\u5019\u707e\u5bb3\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u9500\u552e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u5e38\u89c4\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5dde\u7ea7\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u707e\u5bb3\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u76ca\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6469\u64e6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u5c42\u9762\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6c14\u5019\u707e\u5bb3\u5bf9\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u589e\u52a0\u4f01\u4e1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7f13\u51b2\uff0c\u4f46\u9891\u7e41\u707e\u5bb3\u4e0b\u9500\u552e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5e38\u89c4\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u65e0\u6b64\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u707e\u5bb3\u4e0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u8c03\u6574\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e94\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6469\u64e6\u3002"}}

Judges and scholars have tried to crystallize this dynamic with theories of \"dual federalism,\" \"process federalism,\" \"cooperative federalism,\" or \"federalism by integration.\" But all these models have been suddenly superseded, and rendered obsolete, by an unexpected step-change in the intensity of federal-state conflicts. In the place of longstanding federalism theories, this article demonstrates, a new form of intergovernmental relations has emerged. We call it \"agonistic federalism.\" The article's aim is to introduce and theorize this new form of intergovernmental relation by offering a parsimonious definition, a careful accounting of its current and future vectors, and a cartography of its underlying political economy and potential futures. <span>We define \u201cagonistic federalism\u201d as a zero-sum, no-holds-barred style of contestation between the national government and states that is <span>&nbsp;</span>characterized by mutual, partisan-driven antagonism and intolerance. It is \u201czero sum\u201d in the sense that political coalitions use national and state power not just to advance policy preferences, but to lock-up decisional authority, or power as such. It is \u201cno holds barred\u201d insofar as it is characterized by escalating assertions of formal sovereign power in disregard of judicial precedent, convention, and doctrinal constraints. So defined, agonistic federalism can be traced in the efforts of the national government to eliminate states and local governments\u2019 power to adopt policies disdained by the dominant national coalition even in areas of traditional state competence. As this hardball style of intergovernmental politics radiates from the center, it catalyzes countervailing efforts at self-defense by states. These too press against extant legal boundaries. Understood as a two-sided dynamic, agonistic federalism transforms the incentives, tactics, and ambitions animating federal-state relations. While resonating with certain antebellum-era struggles over tariff policy, fugitive slaves, and control of the territories, moreover, contemporary agonistic federalism has many novel features. As a result, it generates unprecedented strains upon the American body politic. Mapping the resulting uncertainties, we conclude with a catalog of the unsettled and difficult doctrinal questions thrown up by new tactics of agonistic federalism.

Using an internal instruments VAR approach, we find that information shocks associated with policy rate hikes have a statistically significant, economically meaningful, and highly persistent positive effect on R*. This finding supports the presence of feedback loops: when monetary policy reveals information about economic fundamentals, agents revise their consumption and investment decisions, thereby influencing R* and prompting further policy adjustments. We show that the response of R* to information shocks may operate through a productivity channel. Moreover, the effect is sign-asymmetric\u2014stronger following unexpected rate cuts than after rate hikes. These results remain robust when controlling for macroeconomic indicators reflecting recent shocks to the US economy, including fiscal stress, geopolitical risk, energy price fluctuations, and global supply chain disruptions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

We develop new identification and estimation techniques and provide a detailed empirical analysis combining macro time series for the U.S. and a time series of household panels from the PSID."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b8f\u89c2\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u4e2d\u603b\u4f53\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5546\u4e1a\u5468\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "(a) \u5546\u4e1a\u5468\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e2a\u4f53\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff1f(b) \u603b\u4f53\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b8f\u89c2\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\uff1f(c) \u8fd9\u4e9b\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5546\u4e1a\u5468\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u4e2d\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5546\u4e1a\u5468\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b8f\u89c2\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b8f\u89c2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548cPSID\u5bb6\u5ead\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51b2\u51fb\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u5468\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, in many settings, the quantity of interest depends on many inputs which are aggregated non-linearly. In these settings, decompositions need not sum to one and often depend on the order in which inputs are \"zeroed out.\" In this note we describe a simple but convenient alternative. We show that using the Shapley-Owen value, extended to inequality decompositions in Shorrocks (1999, 2013), provides an additive decomposition that sums to one and is easily interpretable in terms of the contribution of different inputs (or groups of them) to some aggregate outcome. We provide several examples to help implement the approach. We believe this is exceptionally well-suited to decompositions in rich-structural models of economic phenomena which are typically non-linear."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eShapley-Owen\u503c\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u52a0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u52a0\u4e3a\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Shapley-Owen\u503c\u53ca\u5176\u5728Shorrocks\uff081999, 2013\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u5206\u89e3\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Shapley-Owen\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u52a0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "findings": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5206\u89e3\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Shapley-Owen\u503c\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u793a\u4f8b\u3002"}}
