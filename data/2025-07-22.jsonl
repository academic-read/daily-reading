To structure our analysis, we introduce a model in which firms confront asymmetric information about heterogeneous consumer preferences and show that AI mitigates these frictions by sharpening firms' ability to learn demand patterns across markets. The model predicts—and the data confirm—that AI-intensive firms fine-tune their product mix and prices with greater precision: they are more likely to export, expand their product lines, and enter new markets.&nbsp; Crucially, this refinement appears as narrower price dispersion but wider quantity dispersion across destinations—effects strongest for differentiated goods, larger firms, and sales to high-income economies.&nbsp; Together, the evidence shows that AI eases demand-side information frictions, allowing firms to optimize their global reach strategies."}}

SMEs play an important role in the Indonesian economy, especially in their contribution to non-oil and gas exports. However, SME export activities are often constrained by volatile fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and suboptimal international marketing strategies implemented. Exchange rate stability is an external factor that greatly affects export performance, as exchange rate changes can significantly impact pricing, profit margins, and product competitiveness in the global market. Meanwhile, international marketing strategy as an internal factor includes product adjustments, pricing strategies, cross-cultural promotions, and the selection of the right distribution channels in the face of global competition. This study uses a quantitative approach with a survey method, where data is collected through the distribution of questionnaires to a number of SMEs who are actively carrying out export activities. The independent variables in this study were exchange rate stability (X1) and international marketing strategy (X2), while the dependent variable was international marketing success (Y). Data analysis was carried out using multiple linear regression with the help of SPSS software, and model testing was carried out through t-test, F test, and determination coefficient (R²) test, accompanied by classical assumption test to ensure model validity. The results of the study show that both partially and simultaneously, exchange rate stability and international marketing strategies have a positive and significant effect on the success of international marketing. A determination coefficient of 0.536 indicates that 53.6% of international marketing success can be explained by these two independent variables, while the rest is influenced by other factors outside of this study model. These findings reinforce the importance of synergy between the management of external factors such as exchange rates and the optimization of marketing strategies so that SMEs can improve their competitiveness and export performance in a sustainable manner. The implication of this study is the need for government support in maintaining macroeconomic stability as well as the provision of training and assistance related to international marketing for SMEs. This research is expected to be a reference for policy makers and business actors in formulating strategies to increase national exports through the empowerment of SMEs."}}

However, it is unclear why individuals voluntarily contribute knowledge, and how platform strategies can facilitate individuals' contributions through non-monetary incentives. I develop a stylized model of individual knowledge contributions where individuals have social motivation to gain reputation and instrumental motivation to obtain functionality privileges on the platform. Based on the model, I design and implement a large-scale field experiment, involving 12,182 individuals on one of the largest online question-and-answer platforms. I sample and manually treat participating platform individuals daily over the course of four and a half months. The treatment gives one anonymous upvote to eligible answers, exogenously shifting individuals' social and instrumental motivations. I then track comprehensive data on individuals' subsequent behavior on the platform daily for four months. I find that the treatment significantly increases an individual's probability of contributing additional answers by around 15% of the baseline, and the difference between the control and treatment groups persists over time. The treatment effect is the most pronounced for individuals with low-to-moderate answering experience or reputation and is slightly stronger for those who are close to obtaining additional privileges after the treatment. The overall quality and effort of future answers remain stable. Using data from the field experiment, I structurally estimate the model of contribution decisions to quantify the relative importance of social and instrumental motivation. Simulation results suggest that social motivation is more important, and platform strategies that boost social motivation are more effective in encouraging contributions."}}

Machine learning technologies will analyze network-related information and operate networks to meet service requirements. Network traffic is one of the most significant information that represents temporal changes of user behavior. Traffic consists of packet series captured at collection points, where the packet inter-arrival times are generally unevenly spaced. Machine learning models trained using large amounts of data, such as large language models, tend to achieve high accuracy. However, the large models are not feasible in real networks where billions of users are connected because the amount of raw traffic is more than thousands Gbps. Therefore, a method is required to maintain accuracy even when training a small amount of traffic. This paper proposes a method to extract features representing characteristics of input traffic. The proposed method determines the minimum length of features per sample, which is input to machine learning models, based on the periodicity analysis of unevenly spaced packet series. We also introduce a function to convert unevenly spaced packet series into evenly spaced time series to adopt periodicity analysis. The evaluation results show that the classification accuracy trained using only a part of traffic is comparable to the accuracy trained using the whole traffic. The results also show that the proposed method improves the accuracy when training only a part of traffic by determining the minimum length of features."}}

In this work, we study the service from a performance perspective across a variety of scenarios and locations. We show that for desktop users, iCloud Private Relay typically reduces speed test and web page performance. However, we find that the overlay routing introduced by the service may improve performance in some cases. Conversely, for mobile users using iPhones on cellular networks, we observe lower speed test throughput while finding negligible changes in web page performance. Our results represent the first detailed study of the effects of large-scale deployment of multi-hop privacy-enhancing architectures. To increase the impact of our work, we contribute our software and measurements to the community."}}

Existing manual detection methods are often inadequate for identifying complex fraud patterns within the growing volume of taxpayer data. This study proposes an integrated framework that combines predictive data mining techniques with a knowledge-based system (KBS) to enhance fraud detection and prevention capabilities within TRDA.The research utilizes historical taxpayer data sourced from TRDA&apos;s SIGTAS and TITCOS systems. Data preprocessing was carried out using SQL Management and Visual Studio .Net. Taxpayers were grouped into three clusters using K-means clustering. Classification algorithms—J48, Naive Bayes, and JRip—were applied using WEKA to identify the most effective predictive model. Among these, JRip achieved the highest accuracy (99.964%) and was selected for integration into the KBS.The rules derived from JRip were encoded into a knowledge base using Java (Apache NetBeans), while PROLOG was used to develop the user interface and integration shell, allowing seamless interaction with the fraud detection system. The prototype underwent rigorous testing, including user acceptance and system performance evaluations, achieving 92.0% and 87.5% success rates, respectively.The results affirm the effectiveness of combining machine learning with rule-based reasoning to detect fraudulent tax behavior in real time. This hybrid approach significantly improves detection accuracy and user interaction. The system demonstrates strong potential for operational deployment, offering a scalable, intelligent solution to support TRDA in protecting public revenue from fraudulent activities."}}

In this paper, we present Real-CATS, a Real-world dataset of Cryptocurrency Addresses with Transaction profileS, serving as a practical training ground that enables the development, evaluation, and comparison of AI detection methods. Real-CATS comprises 50,943 criminal addresses from real-world reports and 102,178 benign addresses from exchange customers. It satifies the C3R characteristics (Comprehensiveness, Classifiability, Customizability, and Real-world Transferability), which are fundamental for building robust detection systems in realistic scenarios. The dataset provides three main functions: 1) facilitating the evaluation of detection methods, 2) enabling the discovery of novel features, and 3) serving as a foundation to expand other cybercrime measurement studies. In particular, Real-CATS helps lower the entry barrier for cross-disciplinary researchers to explore cryptocurrency-related cybercrime detection using AI-based approaches. We believe it will facilitate practical model development and foster interdisciplinary progress in this emerging field. All datasets are available at https://github.com/sjdseu/Real-CATS."}}

Africa’s rising digital footprint, youthful population, socio-economic inequalities, and lack of AI governance laws make the relationship between data protection and deepfakes crucial. Our research examines how 21 existing African data protection laws publicly available in English can address rising deepfakes privacy concerns. We employed qualitative methods of thematic content analyses and structural coding to analyze these 21 data protection laws and then classified the definition into three: (i) expressly stated, (ii) implied, and (iii) narrow. Two independent researchers conducted the thematic coding to ensure reliability and achieved excellent agreement under Cohen’s Kappa agreement score. Our findings indicate that 14 of the 21 laws expressly mentioned deepfake identifiers, images, and voices or either one of them in their definition of personal data. Furthermore, six other countries did not explicitly list images and audio in their laws. Still, their data protection laws are detailed in a way that we can infer by implication that they covered deepfake identifiers. The definition of one Seychelles is so limited that it may not cover the identifiers. We argue that these data protection laws could serve as interim measures to address privacy issues arising from deepfake technologies while advocating for more comprehensive legislation and framework to address legal problems the arising and could arise from deepfake usage."}}

Based on the mathematical principles of commodity exchange, the proposed system establishes a labor-proof mechanism, replacing public ledgers with a peer-to-peer consensus protocol. This innovative approach ensures decentralization and anonymity while addressing the performance and storage limitations of blockchain technology. For the first time, the study defines a standard for measuring value and demonstrates how \"World Yuan\" functions as a substitute for traditional currency by fulfilling the roles of a measure of value, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. The system not only overcomes the common problems of cryptocurrencies such as high volatility and the dependence on fiat money, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to the blockchain, but also shakes the status of currency as the core of exchange. By elucidating the relationships among labor, value and price and exploring novel mechanisms for social exchange and consensus, this work lays the technical groundwork for a future global financial system free from monetary constraints, offering a fresh paradigm for economic and technological innovation."}}

Automation bias, defined as the tendency to excessively trust AI outputs while ignoring contradictory evidence or personal judgment, drives a three-phase cycle: (1) initial dependency development, fueled by perceived AI efficiency; (2) critical thinking atrophy via cognitive offloading; and (3) bias internalization and propagation, where AI biases are inherited and reproduced in human decisions, even without AI support (Kosmyna et al., 2025). Drawing on evidence such as the impact of AI on 40% of global jobs (Georgieva, 2024) and cognitive offloading in education (Kosmyna et al., 2025), we challenge the notion that technical fixes alone can mitigate these effects. We propose Wisdom as a Service (WaaS), a preliminary framework that integrates non-European wisdom traditions… This theoretical approach prioritizes epistemic pluralism and community validation as potential pathways to address the long-term societal consequences of AI over-reliance (inspired by Cleverly (2025), integrating non-European wisdom traditions (e.g., Ubuntu, Nyāya) and decolonized AI architectures to disrupt bias amplification). Automation bias is not just a human-AI interaction problem but a sociocognitive epidemic. Without systemic intervention (e.g., WaaS, decolonized AI), AI biases will become permanent fixtures of human reasoning. This framework prioritizes epistemic multiplicity, community validation, and culturally grounded reasoning to address the long-term societal consequences of AI over-reliance."}}

The discussion posits that AI now represents more than just a technological advancement; it could provide a groundbreaking organisational shift that will challenge traditional healthcare norms, advocating for a holistic organisational transformation rather than incremental updates to legacy. The author posits that by leveraging AI, there is now an opportunity to redefine roles, enhance collaboration, and improve patient outcomes through integrated workflows. However, the author emphasises the necessity of reimagining existing frameworks and embracing radical innovation whilst also addressing challenges related to data privacy and operational efficiency. The article advocates for a new healthcare model for Wales, leveraging AI's capabilities to enhance care delivery.

Traditional security systems often struggle to detect these novel threats due to the high dimensionality of network traffic data and the inability to adapt to unseen patterns. This study proposes an adaptive feature selection framework using swarm intelligence techniques to enhance the prediction accuracy of zero-day attacks. By integrating metaheuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), the model dynamically identifies and selects the most relevant features from high-dimensional datasets, reducing computational complexity while preserving critical anomaly indicators. The selected features are subsequently fed into machine learning classifiers to build a robust zero-day attack detection model. Experimental evaluations on benchmark cybersecurity datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves detection performance, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and faster response times compared to conventional feature selection methods. This research highlights the potential of swarm intelligence as a powerful tool for adaptive, real-time intrusion detection in the face of evolving cyber threats."}}

The introduction of the European Union's AI Act, the first comprehensive legal framework for AI, establishes a global benchmark for regulation, mandating stringent requirements for systems classified as high-risk. This paper examines the critical role of Technical AI Assurance in navigating this new regulatory landscape. We argue that achieving compliance and fostering public trust requires a paradigm shift from post-hoc explainability to by design decision defensibility. We analyse the requirements of the EU AI Act and map them to the operational framework provided by the ISO/IEC 42001 standard for AI Management Systems. Furthermore, we critique the limitations of current explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as their approximative nature and inability to provide causal reasoning, which fall short of delivering true enterprise decision defensibility. As a solution, we propose a \"glass box\" approach, demonstrated by a third generation AI, neuro symbolic platforms like the Tikos Reasoning Platform, which integrate logical reasoning with neural networks to provide end-to-end traceability and generate human-readable, causal explanations. This paper advances that such systems, which bake transparency and auditability into their core architecture, are essential for meeting regulatory demands and building a foundation of verifiable trust in the age of AI."}}

While similar approaches are evident in the EU's Digital Services Act and various national regulations, U.S. states offer particularly revealing cases for understanding how technical mandates get operationalized into specific requirements. Our analysis of recently enacted state-level child online safety laws (COSLs) demonstrates how techno-solutionist logic manifests in three interdependent patterns: (1) the checklist fallacy (reducing safety to discrete technical features), (2) the false promise of age verification (assuming identity verification will prevent harm), and (3) the design determinism myth (overestimating design's power to shape social outcomes). The U.S. offers unique insights through its state-level experimentation, while similar techno-solutionist approaches are emerging worldwide (e.g. UK's Online Safety Bill, EU's Digital Services Act).&nbsp; <br><br>The appeal of techno-legal solutionism transcends borders: from California to Brussels, it offers policymakers seemingly clear solutions to complex problems. However, our analysis shows that this approach fundamentally misunderstands both the social shaping of technology and the complexity of youth wellbeing. Technologies can influence outcomes by offering (or not) certain design features (i.e. affordances); yet these designs do not determine the outcomes. This overconfidence that technology can determine an outcome risks ignoring the more complex and nuanced forces shaping children's online experiences. Moving forward requires abandoning the fallacy that we can simply \"nerd harder\" our way to youth safety-and instead embracing the more challenging work of developing comprehensive, nuanced approaches that recognize both the limitations and possibilities of technical intervention."}}

This article argues that these failures stem from a combination of (1) pervasive information asymmetries that define the data economy and (2) four categories of legislative \"poison pills\" (weak definitions, inadequate disclosure obligations, overbroad exemptions, and insufficient enforcement) that allow corporations to leverage their information advantages to avoid accountability.<br><br> These legislative poison pills do not arise by accident. Instead, as this article describes, they ultimately stem from bills and amendments drafted by the tech industry and its lobbyists. The true objective of these industry interest groups—to stop states from regulating emerging technologies altogether—was laid bare in the summer of 2025 when technology companies and venture capitalists unsuccessfully pressed Congress to completely ban states from regulating ADSs, AI systems, and AI models.<br><br> The combination of information monopolies and legislative poison pills has resulted in a façade of reform that, instead of reining in harmful data economy practices, has allowed them to proliferate. Such toothless legislation is not merely ineffective; it is counterproductive. It enables corporations to further consolidate their information advantages, makes later efforts at regulation more disruptive and difficult, and undermines public confidence in the ability of democratic institutions to serve as effective checks on powerful companies and industries.<br><br> The article contends that legislators must purge tech legislation of these poison pills and require disclosures targeting the underlying information asymmetries, which otherwise prevent not only the detection of harm but the ability to determine the risks that data-driven technologies and practices pose to consumers and workers. It further proposes affirmative measures such as whistleblower protections, mandatory reporting, and fiduciary duties to pry open corporate black boxes and address hidden harms from data-driven technologies and practices. Genuine progress will require lawmakers to recognize the scale of corporations' information advantages and reject the poison pills by seeing them for what they are: an effort by the tech industry to obtain by sleight-of-hand the regulatory free pass that it has so far failed to obtain from Congress.<br> <br> <i>This article solely represents the views of the author, and not those of the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology.</i>"}}

Exploiting the European Union’s investigation on new energy vehicles (NEVs) from China, we find that firms in the NEV sector and export to the European Union experienced a statistically and economically significant negative market reaction of -2.3%. The value loss is more severe for firms with greater exposures to this investigation, i.e., firms with more foreign exports and more government subsidies for NEVs. Moreover, we find that <i>innovation capabilities</i> (R&amp;D investment intensity, non-self patent citations, and number of NEV-related patents), <i>financial viability</i> (bank-firm relationships and working capital efficiency), and <i>supply chain adaptiveness</i> (cost-sharing abilities along the supply chain and geographical diversification) help mitigate the negative price reactions. We further show that the value loss spills over to treated firms’ suppliers and customers. Our results provide direct evidence that tariff shocks create substantial impacts on the targeted high-tech firm and identify key characteristics that enhance high-tech firms’ resilience in the face of global trade frictions, offering valuable insights for firm managers and policymakers.<span></span></span></p>"}}

Our findings indicate that females tend to provide higher backward evaluations than males and exhibit less deviations in their evaluations. Drawing on the theory of social value orientation, we proposed interventions through motivational frameworks and confirm that different frameworks exert distinct effects on learners of different genders. Specifically, the competition framework was proved to be more effective in reducing unfair backward evaluation behaviors among females, while the cooperation framework was more effective for males. This study broadens the scope of research on backward evaluation and offers practical strategies to ensure its fairness in applications."}}

As the primary beneficiaries of higher education, university students are transitioning from traditional learning methods to intelligent learning methods. However, current research on artificial intelligence in education has been overly focused on rational dimensions such as knowledge transfer, intelligent assessment, and personalised learning, while severely neglecting the emotional experiences and intrinsic motivations that are crucial to the learning process of university students. Method: We combined the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model to analyse the emotional perceptions influencing their use of DeepSeek as a learning tool. This study collected 476 valid responses through an online questionnaire survey. Conclusions: This study reveals the critical role of emotions and motivation in university students&apos; adoption of generative AI learning technologies. The findings indicate that students&apos; perceptions of tool convenience not only enhance evaluations of practicality and usability but also stimulate positive emotional experiences—designs aligned with learning habits enhance a sense of control and pleasure, becoming the core drivers for sustained use. Students with high self-efficacy demonstrate unique advantages, as they can establish an emotional connection between the tool&apos;s functions and their personal needs, forming the belief that ‘I can use the technology effectively,’ thereby effectively reducing usage barriers. This helps to understand the key factors influencing university students&apos; sustained adoption of learning technologies and reduces perceived barriers to the adoption of generative AI learning platforms among university students."}}

Many organizations pursuing agile transformation mistakenly treat governance as overhead, resulting in superficial autonomy, risk accumulation, and accountability deficits. This paper presents agile governance not as a contradiction, but as an essential strategic function necessary for organizations in complex or regulated sectors. Drawing on systems thinking, regulatory case studies, and transformation insights, the paper outlines a framework for fit-for-purpose governance that balances autonomy with accountability. Key concepts include \"constraint literacy,\" governance as an embedded learning mechanism, and designing governance systems that dynamically integrate regulatory requirements without sacrificing adaptiveness. It further discusses governance through measurement, exploring how metrics can both undermine and enhance agile practices. Ultimately, agile governance must evolve beyond trust-based assumptions to deliberate systemic design. This paper provides practical guidelines and illustrative examples demonstrating how governance, when intentionally structured, can enable organizations to operate safely, adaptively, and sustainably within complex constraints."}}

(1) Formation of supplier coalitions can be beneficial for all stakeholders including the retailer, the suppliers, and the society and environment, but achieving such a win-win-win outcome depends on two key factors –the market’s consciousness rate (i.e., the percentage of socially conscious consumers in the whole customer group) and the efficiency improvement brought by forming the coalitions. (2) The grand coalition that maximizes the retailer’s profit and product CSR level is not always stable as free-riding phenomena among suppliers are prevalent; for example, the less efficient suppliers in a coalition are more likely to defect from an existing coalition because the defection enables them to save cost of making sustainable innovation effort, while enjoying the benefit of other coalitions’ high innovationefforts (cross-coalition free-riding). (3) From the supply side, adopting the Shapley value allocation rule enhances the within-coalition free-riding effect by assigning an even larger profit share to the the less efficient supplier, while it can mitigate these suppliers’ incentive to defect and thus strengthen the stability of the coalition; in addition, we find that a higher total efficiency and a smaller efficiency gap can further enhance the stability of the grand coalition. (4) From the demand side, we show that the effects of an improvement in the market’s consciousness rate are non-monotonic; hence, the retailer should be cautious, as improperly inducing consumers’ social consciousness could backfire, destabilizing thecoalition and leading to unintended consequences.</span>"}}

However, questions and controversies remain. Should the dishonest assistants be required to account for profits made from that assistance? If so, what principles govern the remedy?<br><br>The contemporary analyses concerning an account of profits in dishonest assistance are primarily driven by a “status” centric approach.

We formalize this concept mathematically using a stateupdate mechanism, demonstrating how awareness influences strategic behavior. The core of our contribution is the \"Shadow Auction\" game-a modified auction format where players submit an initial bid based on partial information and a shadow bid after seeing the opponent's move. By analyzing this game, we show that uncertainty awareness can lead to novel phenomena not captured by traditional Nash equilibria. This work expands game theory toward a more realistic model of bounded decision-making, incorporating adaptive learning and risk adjustment."}}

Drawing from the Parallel Pathways model-which conceptualizes hope and fear as neurobiologically linked by their relationship to action-this framework addresses a common but overlooked phenomenon in coaching: hopeful paralysis. The Preparedness Ladder offers a structured, four-stage process that supports coaches in identifying cognitive or emotional stalling, mentally priming action pathways, and establishing micro-commitments and pre-freeze protocols to bypass default freeze responses. Each stage is informed by distinct neural mechanisms, particularly the shift from ventrolateral to dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG to dlPAG) dominance. An accompanying Neural State Shifting protocol deepens the model's utility by enabling targeted interventions based on the client's neurochemical and behavioral state. While conceptual in scope, this framework provides a practical and ethically bounded tool for coaches working with action-resistant clients, and offers clear implications for future empirical study and potential application across organizational, educational, and health behavior domains."}}

Post-Keynesian economics models the economy as a private-sector-led system where the state intervenes reactively, while MMT positions the state as the constitutive architect of monetary systems, designing market operations through taxation, currency issuance, and fiscal policy. Key areas examined include treasury-central bank operations, external sector dynamics, unemployment, and interest rate policy. The paper also addresses MMT's intellectual origins in financial practice rather than heterodox theory and analyses sociological factors shaping its contentious reception within economics. We conclude that constructive MMT-PK dialogue requires acknowledging these ontological roots to reconcile divergent policy prescriptions."}}

Furthermore, component-level knowledge enhances innovation outcomes only when complementors also possess architectural knowledge, particularly when the latter is modeled as a binary variable. These results highlight the importance of combining structural understanding with prior development experience to produce high-performing complementary products.

It critiques traditional cognitive models (notably Kahneman's), integrates recent theories on emotion and value, and draws a clear distinction between human and machine consciousness. The argument is made that understanding cognition requires centering emotion and value as foundational, not peripheral, elements. Within this theoretical framework, \"Value\" represents: Definition of the term \"Value\": Represents an individual's dynamically constructed and contextually-dependent perception of worth, significance, or desirability-fundamentally shaped by their unique history, experiences, and evolutionary predispositions. It is not a static calculation or objective measure but rather an iterative process of cognitive appraisal and emotional response, resulting in a personalized valuation system that actively guides behavior toward perceived satisfaction and promotes individual growth. This system mirrors the broader dynamics of naturewhere non-human living beings, including plants and animals, operate through a similar process of value perception to drive growth, survival, and evolution. Just as a tree seeks sunlight or an animal pursues food, value guides behavior toward desired outcomes and promotes individual growth. This inherent drive to seek \"value\"-whether it's a resource, connection, or experience-is rooted in the very nature of consciousness and life itself, extending beyond humanspecific interpretations. This process is not solely driven by conscious intention, but also by ingrained instincts and physiological needs."}}

This paper introduces the concept of Circular Innovation Streams, a self-reinforcing model in which empowered individuals not only adopt emerging technologies but also drive their evolution. Unlike traditional linear models of innovation diffusion, Circular Innovation Streams emphasize recursive feedback: investor behavior generates innovation pressure, which reshapes platform features, further enhancing investor autonomy and influence. To formalize this dynamic, a recursive mathematical model is developed that links investor empowerment (Et), investor behavior (Bt), innovation outcomes (It), and platform evolution (Pt) over time. A stylized algorithm illustrates the core feedback mechanism, providing a foundation for future agent-based simulations and empirical validation. This formalization captures how digitally empowered investors fuel a continuous cycle of technological and financial innovation."}}

The proposed model improves upon conventional multi-objective programming by effectively handling the hierarchical decision-making processes, the uncertainties of interval and random factors, as well as the risk of constraint violation. Moreover, an integrated method combining singular spectrum analysis, seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average, Light Gradient Boosting Machine with Monte Carlo simulation is proposed to simulate the volatility of the passenger volume. Then, a real case is formulated that considers the relationships among government, airlines and consumers. In the short term, carbon trading has a greater impact on carbon reductions than sustainable aviation fuel. Narrow-body aircrafts in big carriers represent both a major source of carbon emissions and a substantial opportunity for decarbonization. The desired results can offer valuable recommendations for carbon abatement while significantly enhancing the operational efficiency of airlines."}}

Instead, recourse to robust consumer protection and mass tort litigation provides the best avenue for holding the firearms industry accountable. Chapters highlight three important interventions: the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, the Connecticut Sandy Hook Elementary School litigation, and the recent enactment of consumer protection and public nuisance firearms statutes in nine states. These innovative statutes have created an avenue for litigation that overcomes the firearm industry's historical immunity. Outgunned No More concludes that a firearms mass tort litigation, modeled after the resolution of claims in the tobacco industry, is the best path forward."}}

While the UK and the EU have similar worries about outward flows, especially to the U.S. markets, fundamental differences in their capital market ecosystems result in divergence in their regulatory responses. The paper highlights similarities and differences in key UK and EU initiatives aimed at improving capital market access for domestic growth companies and large privately-owned companies. The persistent difficulty of closing funding gaps for growth companies and providing exits for investors in privately-owned companies, coupled with the growing importance of private capital markets, has elevated this policy area to one of strategic importance. The paper explores the challenges faced by public growth markets and. considers how their competitive position may be impacted by the introduction, led by the UK, of a new ‘private plus’ type of stock exchange for privately-owned companies. Stimulated by the scholarship of Roberta Romano, this paper examines the UK and EU retention efforts through the lens of defensive regulatory competition. Key findings relate to (i) diversity in legal transplants; (ii) the limits of regulatory solutions in addressing market ecosystem problems; and (iii) the (mis)alignment between market friendly solutions and socially optimal outcomes.&nbsp;"}}

The Jhelum River originates from Verinag Spring in the Pir Panjal Mountain range. It is susceptible to extreme flooding events, including the recent devastating 2014 Kashmir flood, with continued flooding threatening lives and property in the region. Therefore, good hydrological prediction models are needed to forecast water levels, especially floods. In this study, we used 56 years (i.e. 1969–2024) of historical data for the study area, which included discharge (m3/s), rainfall (mm), temperature (°C), humidity (%), and wind speed (km/h) from five gauging stations and four meteorological stations. The study used four machine learning models: Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost to predict streamflow at Padshahi Bagh gauging station in Srinagar. We used an 80:20 train-test split to evaluate the performance of the models based on the training and testing errors. For the models analysed, XGBoost achieved the highest generalisation performance (i.e. R2 = 0.7736), while CatBoost had the best training accuracy (i.e. R2 = 0.9976), which indicates overfitting. The study demonstrates that ensemble learning models can be utilised for forecasting in a complex snow-fed basin such as the Jhelum River, with parameters from an actual basin observed for 56 years, where XGBoost provided a more robust and deployable solution for predicting streamflow of the Jhelum River. This research demonstrates the rationale to expand machine learning in hydrological modelling, while improving flood forecasting, water resource planning, and climate resilience through the prediction of streamflow in the Himalayan area."}}

Smart Building Energy Management Systems (SBEMS) play a crucial role in achieving this goal by leveraging automation and advanced analytics.

While traditional statistical methods have been widely used for load forecasting, recent advancements in deep learning provide robust alternatives to address the inherent complexity of nonlinear energy consumption patterns. This research employs regression analysis and state-of-the-art neural network architectures, including Single-Step and Multi-Step Dense Models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, K-means clustering is introduced to segment buildings into distinct energy-demand categories, ensuring optimal energy utilization. Unlike prior studies that often lack a comprehensive approach, this work integrates all critical features under a unified framework. By applying these advanced methodologies to a unique dataset, the proposed system demonstrates improved accuracy in energy load forecasting and clustering, providing a significant contribution to the field of smart building energy management."}}

Second, it provides insight into the contested evolution of essential corporate attributes by analyzing which features of the modern corporation the Act provided and which it omitted, contributing to ongoing scholarly debates about the truly indispensable characteristics of the corporate form. The statute's design reveals contemporary understanding of how corporate privileges could encourage high-risk entrepreneurial ventures by providing limited liability, centralized management, and rudimentary asset partitioning.

Methods and tools that can be used to assess the effectiveness of attracting financing in the public debt market are quite broad. However, the more factors are taken into account in such an assessment, the better and more reliable the assessment will be. The effectiveness of attracting financing in the country's public debt market should take into account the conditions that characterize the state of the country's economy. The best option is to take into account the macroeconomic parameters of economic development, such as: the volume of GDP in actual prices, state budget revenues, the size of international reserves, inflation index. After all, it is the macroeconomic situation in the country that determines the opportunities and the need to attract financing in the external and domestic markets of public debt. The effectiveness of attracting financing in the public debt market can be carried out using both qualitative and quantitative instruments. The calculation of the efficiency ratio refers to quantitative statistical evaluation methods. In this case, this ratio can be modified by adding a number of new factors that are defined as either positive or negative factors. The assessment of debt financing is carried out in terms of external and domestic debt of two countries – Ukraine and Poland, which are at different levels of economic development.

In this study, we developed an innovative modeling approach of hybridizing a process-based model and a data-driven model for the karst systems influenced by seasonal snow cover, and tested its application to a large, complex karst system in the Unica River catchment in Slovenia. For this purpose, the process-based model Génie Rural à 6 paramètres Journalier including the CemaNeige snow routine (CemaNeige GR6J) was hybridized with the Stacked Autoencoder Deep Neural Networks (SAE-DNN). A 60-year period of catchment discharge observations from 1962 to 2021 was used for model development, testing and evaluation. The performance of the stand-alone models CemaNeige GR6J as well as SAE-DNN, and the hybrid model CemaNeige GR6J-SAE-DNN was systematically compared. The results show that the hybrid model clearly outperforms the stand-alone process-based model and the data-driven model, especially during the extreme flow conditions. To better understand the hybrid model behavior, the Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) was used and showed that the slow and fast flow components contributed significantly to the overall performance of the hybrid model. Overall, the proposed hybrid modeling approach provides an innovative way to robustly predict the daily discharge behavior of karst systems influenced by seasonal snow cover, especially during extreme flow conditions, and can be easily applied to other karst systems with similar characteristics to support robust decision making in karst water resource management."}}

The second is based on the theory of effective public debt management, which recognizes the potential positive effects of rising public debt. This second theory is supported by the successful operation of countries with significant debt burdens.In this context, the uniqueness of the conditions for debt financing of state budget deficits in different economies has been demonstrated. Particular attention is given to the exogenous environment influencing Ukraine’s state debt formation, based on which thirteen factors causing the uncontrolled growth of Ukraine’s public debt were identified and substantiated.Using a hierarchization of threats, six levels of factors influencing the level of public debt were identified. Among the most significant threats leading to the growth of public debt are factors closely related to the budget deficit. In contrast, Ukraine’s dependence on energy imports, cyclical economic fluctuations, the influence of political business cycles, and the technical backwardness of a significant part of Ukraine’s national economy were found to be the least influential.These factors have the highest impact on all sectors of the economy and, therefore, exhibit the widest range of interconnections. The simulation results confirm that the existence of debt and its potential transition to an uncontrolled state of growth are different situations, each of which requires specific effective management.\n</div>"}}

Funded and unfunded firms show a divergence in trends 6-months post-approval. After 3 years, funded firms are about four times more likely to survive, have more employees, and earn higher income. However, only a handful of firms hire above the requirements for getting funding. We find no evidence of increases in labor productivity or patenting. We find no effects on founder taxpaying status or founder total income. Comparing funded subindustries with similar ones not treated, as well as counties more and less treated, we find no equilibrium effects on economic activity (income, number of employees, employee income), despite higher numbers of new firms. The evidence is consistent with a trade-off when designing grant programs: simple, broad programs, with bureaucratic hurdles ensuring prudent usage of public funds can inadvertently dampen the emergence of high-growth, high-productivity, innovative start-ups."}}

We begin by revisiting the various definitions of abduction, starting with the one proposed by Peirce, who conceptualized it as a form of logical inference enabling a “jump to a conclusion” from given facts. Post-Peircean semiotics retains the central idea that abduction is a logical inference that allows for “best guessing” and, as such, can lead to both fallacious reasoning and highly innovative insights. Particularly relevant is Umberto Eco’s classification of abduction into three types: overcoded, undercoded, and creative. Expanding the notion into an ecosystemic framework, we examine two significant definitions of abduction, namely those of Gregory Bateson and Victoria Alexander. Bateson argues that abduction is a fundamental process underpinning most of our perceptions and knowledge of the world, enhancing our capacity for abstraction. Alexander, on the other hand, introduces a concept closely related to abduction: stochastic resonance. We argue that the theoretical framework which best integrates and enriches these perspectives is found in the field of Code Biology, where abduction is conceived as a vital process that enables human beings to interpret their environment, where three processes are necessary for interpretation: coding, decoding and abduction. Finally, we present several theories of abduction developed within one of the most application-oriented domains of creativity studies: design."}}

A qualitative methodology is adopted, comprising in-depth interviews with 42 stakeholders across various sectors involved in the industry’s circular ecosystem. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis supported by the STEEP framework, which includes Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, and Political dimensions, to categorize and interpret the key influencing factors. The study identifies seven stakeholder groups that play essential roles in facilitating or hindering the CE transition. Findings reveal that the most influential drivers are environmental factors, particularly global regulations and certification schemes, which push the industry to adopt circular practices. In contrast, the most significant barriers are political, including the lack of coherent government support and insufficient incentive programs targeted at the textile sector. Technological and economic constraints, such as inadequate recycling infrastructure and high production costs, also present notable challenges. By focusing on stakeholder perspectives, the study highlights the external dimensions shaping CE adoption and provides practical implications across the five STEEP dimensions. The insights contribute to a better understanding of how stakeholder dynamics influence systemic transformation and offer a framework for identifying roles, challenges, and opportunities within the circular ecosystem of Thailand’s TFI."}}

This study presents a weather-aware, multi-modal optimization framework that integrates drones and ground vehicles to enhance last-mile healthcare logistics. The model accounts for vehicle routing, depot and facility siting, time-sensitive delivery, transshipment, and recharging decisions under operational and environmental constraints. Drone energy consumption is estimated using a dynamic model that incorporates local weather conditions and temporal variations. We develop multiple case study instances based on real-world data from rural Southern Illinois and evaluate the model’s performance across various delivery configurations, including ground-only, drone-only, and hybrid networks. Results show that drone-only configurations reduce costs by up to 47% in low-volume, dispersed settings. In high-volume cases—defined by dense demand clusters and larger total order weights—hybrid solutions significantly improve delivery efficiency, cutting average delivery time by more than 50% while preserving operational feasibility. Compared to simplified range-based models commonly used in the literature, the proposed approach more accurately captures energy demands and enables better-informed routing decisions—offering a robust platform for navigating trade-offs between cost, timeliness, and network complexity in rural healthcare logistics."}}

They go through a dynamic decision-making process: requesting service, waiting for matching, and deciding on boarding service. In addition, they lack precise trip information since services are not scheduled in advance and vary flexibly. To cope with uncertainty, users decide whether to utilize on-demand mobility services based on travel information and experience, adjusting their decision-making rules based on experience. Although these characteristics are crucial for service demand, the dynamic behaviors underlying on-demand mobility service usage have not been thoroughly explored. This study aims to develop an imitation learning framework for modeling dynamic decision-making process of on-demand mobility services. A Markov decision process is employed to represent the sequential decision-making process of on-demand mobility service users. The reward function is formulated as a linear combination of travel context attributes, aligning with a utility function. Interaction terms are introduced to capture the sensitivity varying with experience. Reinforcement learning, where agents update their decision rules based on rewards from their choices, represents travelers’ behavior. Then, inverse reinforcement learning is applied to infer reward parameters. To implement this approach, we conducted empirical research on the I-MOD service, a demand-responsive service transit operated in Yeongjong-do, Incheon, South Korea. Empirical findings revealed positive feedback on on-demand mobility services in that travelers with more experience are likely to utilize them more frequently. Moreover, rewards varying with experience can improve predictive accuracy in forecasting on-demand mobility service ridership trends."}}

Cross-sectional tests reveal that the increase in workplace misconduct is more pronounced among firms with weaker labor union coverage, lower innovation capacity, weaker reputational incentives, poor internal governance, and limited reliance on skilled labor. Furthermore, we identify heightened workplace tension, reduction in workplace safety-related investment, and increased workload as potential mechanisms through which workplace gun rights influence workplace misconduct. Overall, the findings underscore the critical role of workplace gun legislation in exacerbating workplace misconduct."}}

A robust econometric framework—combining Two-Step System GMM, Quantile Regression, and Two-Way Fixed Effects—addresses endogeneity, heterogeneity, and distributional asymmetries. Results show technological innovation, governance quality, urbanization, and human development significantly enhance logistics performance across quantiles, while employment and gross fixed capital formation show diminishing or adverse effects beyond thresholds. Human capital strongly drives economic growth, yet logistics performance is negatively linked to economic expansion but positively correlated with transport-related CO₂ emissions, reflecting carbon-intensive supply chains.

However, the intermittency of renewable electricity and the availability of parallel revenue opportunities in both the electricity and hydrogen markets complicate the scheduling of green hydrogen production. The scheduling should maximise the total revenue from short-term sales of electricity and hydrogen against the long-term HPA delivery obligations. This challenge is addressed by developing a Bounded Fuzzy Logic Control (BFLC) which determines the daily HPA delivery target based on day-ahead forecasts of electricity and hydrogen prices, as well as wind capacity factors. Subsequently, the daily target is imposed as a constraint in dispatch optimisation which allocates energy and hydrogen flows for each hour of the day. Revenue comparisons over several years demonstrate that the BFLC achieves total annual revenues within 9% of optimal revenues that are based on perfect foresight. The BFLC revenues consistently exceed those of steady control, with the largest differences observed under conditions of elevated price levels and variability. The BFLC provides an effective long-term scheduling of green hydrogen production, enabling realistic revenue quantification that mitigates economic risks without overlooking economically viable projects."}}

Therefore, it is crucial to strategically plan EV charging stations and achieve a coordinated configuration with distributed power devices. This paper proposes a two-layer optimization model for ADN that incorporates V2G and EV considerations. The upper layer of the model determines the optimal siting and capacity planning for each device through the collaborative planning of EV charging stations and other devices, while the lower layer accounts for the temporal and spatial scheduling characteristics of EVs in V2G and schedules the flexible resources within the ADN. The model&apos;s validity is demonstrated through an example, indicating a potential reduction in investment costs by 2.8%, a decrease in total operating costs of the ADN by 10.5%, and a reduction in the wind curtailment rate by 1.2% and the solar power curtailment rate by 2.8%."}}

This strategy aims to reduce hydrogen consumption, stabilize the state of charge (SOC) of the battery, and delay the degradation of fuel cell performance. A multi-objective reward function integrating three performance indicators is constructed, and the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm is improved based on this. The EDQN5 algorithm is constructed by integrating mechanisms such as priority experience replay, dueling network, multi-step learning, target network, and noise network. To enhance the generalization ability of the strategy under variable operating conditions, a driving condition partitioning method based on SMk-means is further proposed. Based on the partitioning results, reinforcement learning agents are trained for each condition to form corresponding sub strategies. At the same time, a driving pattern recognizer integrating the dung beetle optimization algorithm (DBO) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) is constructed, and a sliding window mechanism is introduced to enhance the robustness and real-time performance of online recognition. The verification results indicate that the \"driving condition hierarchical training plus strategy adaptive switching\" control framework, which dynamically switches sub strategies based on online recognition results, has been finally implemented, effectively improving the energy management performance of FCHEV in complex driving environments, and showing significant advantages in both economy and stability."}}

Bio-based plastics like PEF offer a promising alternative that could help reduce this environmental impact. For bio-based plastics to achieve widespread adoption, they must be accepted and purchased (i.e., preferred) by consumers. Although several conceptual frameworks have been proposed to explain consumers’ preferences for bioplastics – drawing on a substantial body of prior research from marketing/ economic and environmental psychology – it is important to note that earlier empirical findings have been integrated primarily in a descriptive manner. As a result, the assumed relationships of the determinants within these frameworks have not yet been empirically tested – neither in terms of their structural composition nor with regard to quantifying their influence on consumers’ preferences for bioplastics. The present study aimed to take a first step toward developing a comprehensive psychological model to explain consumers’ preferences for bio-based PEF. In March 2025, an online survey was conducted with a sample of the German consumers (N = 566). Drawing on insights from previous research in the bioplastics domain and well-established environmental psychological theories, we investigated how participants’ PEF-related beliefs and their attitude towards PEF as well as their personal and subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and habits for sustainable consumption influenced participants’ (hypothetical) PEF purchase decisions. Taken together, the findings of this study offer a broad range of implications for both practical interventions and future research aimed at further understanding the determinants of consumer preferences for bio-based plastics."}}

Although existing research has highlighted the importance of experience in broker&apos;s ability to extract brokerage benefits, how experience influences the evolution of structural holes remains unclear, particularly in contexts where structural holes terminate through closure or disintermediation. Drawing on organizational learning theory and social network theory, we categorize experience into cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions to examine how individual experiences of both broker and alters, along with their interactions, shape structural hole evolution.We tested our hypotheses in the context of joint patent applications among 41 major Chinese research organizations between 1996 and 2020, encompassing 36,338 patent applications. Our findings reveal that while individual cognitive experiences of both broker and alters contribute to structural hole closure or inhibit disintermediation, their interaction paradoxically facilitates structural hole evolution toward disintermediation. Conversely, non-cognitive experiences, both independently and interactively, consistently inhibit disintermediation. Furthermore, our examination of disintermediation&apos;s impact on both parties&apos; outputs reveals that disintermediation suppresses broker&apos;s innovative output while enhancing alters&apos;. These results illuminate the distinctly different operational mechanisms of cognitive versus non-cognitive experiences in structural hole evolution, as well as the differential outcomes of disintermediation on both parties&apos; innovative outputs.This study advances our understanding of network dynamics in organizational innovation and offers significant implications for R&D management strategy."}}

In this study, we propose a parsimonious methodology that uses t-tests to verify load stability and the correlation of load with gross domestic product (GDP) to arrive at a long-term hourly load forecast. Applying this method to Singapore&apos;s electricity demand, analysis of multi-year historical data (2004-2022) reveals that its relative hourly load has remained statistically stable, with an overall percentage deviation of 4.24% across seasonality indices. Utilizing these stability findings, five-year-ahead total yearly forecasts were generated using gross domestic product (GDP) as a predictor, and the hourly loads were then forecasted using hourly seasonality index fractions. The maximum Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) across multiple experiments of six years ahead forecasts was only 6.87%. We then further apply the methodology to Belgium (an OECD country) and Bulgaria (a non-OECD country), to arrive at MAPE values of 6.81% and 5.64%, respectively. Additionally, stability results were incorporated into a short-term forecasting model based on exponential smoothing, demonstrating comparable or improved accuracy relative to existing machine learning-based methods. The findings show that parsimonious approaches can be effective in arriving at long-term, high resolution forecasts."}}

The industrial chain is deconstructed from the perspectives of production linkage and R&D linkage, and a multi-layer network structure model of the industrial chain is constructed by complex network theory. The impacts of external risks on production activities, R&D activities, and collaborative activities are abstracted as intra-layer time delays (across industries within a layer) and inter-layer time delays (within industries across layers) in the multi-layer network of the industrial chain. Based on this, a multi-layer time-delay network dynamics model of the industrial chain is developed by integrating structural and behavioral characteristics. Taking the auxiliary system method, the synchronization criteria for the multi-layer time-delay network of the industrial chain are analyzed to explore the time-delay thresholds under the conditions of intra-layer and inter-layer time delays. By integrating the control strategy with heuristic search algorithms, the problem of identifying key links is transformed into a pinning node search problem. Taking China’s new energy vehicle industrial chain as a case study, key links in its multi-layer time-delay network under different external risk scenarios are identified."}}

We assemble a novel dataset of patent licenses disclosed by public firms, and all firms that cited the patents are at risk of licensing.

Interestingly, we observe heterogeneous effects: pure online players benefit less from AI investment than traditional and multichannel retailers and wholesalers. In addition, firms with higher operational complexity experience larger decreases in inventory levels. Conversely, high labor intensity hinders the effectiveness of AI investment and adversely impacts inventory performance. <b>Managerial Implications:</b> We provide empirical evidence that AI investment improves inventory performance, especially when combined with supply chain expertise. Managers should consider: prioritize \"algorithm bilinguals\"-professionals blending AI skills with domain knowledge-over overall AI human capital, account for a payoff lag, tailor AI investment to their specific operational contexts to optimize AI-driven reductions in inventory levels."}}

Cloud-based quantum platforms have made quantum hardware accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. However, current usage models still face important limitations. Despite growing demand, quantum computers often remain under-utilized, as tasks are executed sequentially, blocking all available qubits regardless of their actual usage. This leads to long queue times, high execution costs, and inefficient resource utilization. To address these problems, the following paper presents QCRAFT AutoScheduler, a Python-based programming library that optimizes the use of Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The proposed library automatically multiprograms a quantum circuit with multiple copies of itself until it reaches or approaches the maximum capacity of the processor. By multiprogramming circuits, the approach reduces idle qubits, reducing execution costs, and reducing the number of required shots. To demonstrate these advantages, QCRAFT AutoScheduler has been validated on different real quantum computers provided by IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket. The obtained results showcase demonstrate the effectiveness of this tool to improve resource utilization in quantum computing, obtaining an average shot reduction of 85% and 96% in AWS and IBM executions respectively."}}

While traditional machine learning models can offer predictive tools, they often struggle to process unstructured textual metadata, such as plot, cast, and genre. Moreover, these models rarely account for the competitive dynamics that affect film performance at launch. To address these limitations, we propose a novel prediction framework powered by large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, which enables context-aware predictions using only pre-release information. Methodology/results: We develop an LLM-based prediction framework that directly processes textual metadata through advanced prompt engineering techniques-Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thoughtto structure the model's reasoning process. The prompts guide the model to consider both intrinsic film attributes and the competitive landscape at the time of release. Using a dataset of 1,585 films released in China between 2012 and 2019, we show that the LLM-based framework consistently outperforms machine learning benchmarks in predictive accuracy. We also perform robustness checks to evaluate the framework on 2024 releases, which fall outside GPT-4o's pretraining window, and to conduct repeated trials with different prompting strategies. All results showcase the framework's generalizability and reproducibility. Furthermore, we leverage the framework to simulate alternative release timings for a subset of underperformed films in a counterfactual analysis. We find that the strategic scheduling identified by the framework could increase box-office revenue for individual film as well as the whole market. Managerial implications: Our results highlight the potential of LLMs as both predictive tools and decision support systems in movie industry, especially for smaller studios seeking to avoid direct competition with blockbusters. The proposed framework offers a practical, low-barrier solution for producers, distributors, and marketers to evaluate release strategies and forecast performance, without requiring technical expertise. By simulating alternative release scenarios, practitioners can identify strategic release timing that substantially enhance box-office performance."}}

Tracing a conceptual timeline from ancient arithmetic and Euclidean geometry through Cartesian frames, calculus, and modern logic, the essay demonstrates how each mathematical epoch was shaped by philosophical, political, and technological conditions. It culminates in the emergence of quantum logic and the qubit, where contradiction is no longer avoided but embraced. Throughout, the essay argues for a shift in perspective: from viewing foundations as fixed to recognising them as emergent, adaptive, and contextdependent. By integrating historical insight with the dynamics of complex systems, the essay opens a path towards a mathematics that is more reflective of the entangled, evolving world it seeks to describe."}}

Yet many still operate from a compliance-era mindset that treats culturally or politically sensitive speech as inherently risky, particularly when expressed by individuals in visible roles. This article reconceptualises such speech as a form of governance friction, a diagnostic signal that personal identity, role expectations, and institutional values may be misaligned. Rather than defaulting to censorship or sanction, it argues that these moments offer an opportunity to enhance legitimacy through structured reflection and pluralist inclusion. Grounded in the theories of Goffman, Sen, and Breda, and supported by a two-axis governance typology, the article proposes a friction-sensitive approach to Code of Conduct reform. Four Australian frameworks are examined: the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency's \"reflection loop\" model and the Law Society of New South Wales' reliance on broad reputational clauses offer contrasting regulatory logics; the National Code of Conduct for Health Care Workers exemplifies the limitations of prescriptive, compliance-based norms; and the AIATSIS Code of Ethics demonstrates best-practice design in culturally grounded governance. From these, the article derives a practical framework comprising (1) a diagnostic typology for assessing identity expression, (2) a procedural pathway prioritising deliberation over discipline, and (3) friction-sensitive drafting techniques to support legitimacy without silencing lawful expression. The resulting model equips professional associations to uphold standards, navigate cultural complexity, and build public trust in a pluralist society."}}

To boost its market, a novel model integrating insurance and remanufacturing has emerged. This paper constructs a supply chain system consisting of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), a Third-Party Remanufacturer (TPR), an insurance institution, and consumers. Dynamic game models are established under three different government subsidy strategies. The analysis reveals the impacts on stakeholders’ decisions, demands, and profits, guiding subsidy policy-making. Research indicates that subsidizing the TPR and subsidizing consumers post-claim have similar effects. Subsidizing all consumers who purchase the remanufactured-part-claim insurance is more effective in expanding the market share of remanufactured parts. When both the claims ratio and consumer acceptance of remanufactured products are high, this model can bring a win-win for the government and supply chain members."}}

Using a utility function of nonprofit workers’ behavior, we uncover the tension grantmakers feel between best serving the interests of their foundation’s board and their nonprofit grantees. We find that grantmakers often use nonprofits’ readily available accounting information in sophisticated ways for their grant decision-making, rather than requiring burdensome reports, such as audits, as a condition for grant funding. Our findings have implications for nonprofits seeking funding and foundations wishing to develop best practices for grantmaking. Further, our finding that foundation grantmakers use different information in their decision-making than individual donors has implications for nonprofit researchers, managers, and regulators.</span>"}}

This perspective fails to consider the indirect risk factors that may contribute to the fatality from different levels of the mining system. This study proposes the application of systems thinking models and methods to gain a deeper understanding of the complex safety dynamics within the mining industry. The study adopts a systems thinking framework to (1) map the contributory factors identified in publicly available coronial inquests that are associated with the levels of the mining system and (2) identify the relationships between contributory factors to inform recommendations addressing systemic issues. A qualitative template analysis was conducted on 17 coronial inquests from a state in Australia. A systems thinking incident review taxonomy was applied to categorise contributory factors, resulting in the identification of 89 distinct factors and 173 relationships across the system. As predicted, the majority of contributory factors were identified at the level of frontline staff and other operational personnel. This study recommends guidance for employers on interpreting the standards and guidelines that govern the industry, with the goal of protecting both contracted and non-contracted staff."}}

This research examines strategic approaches implemented by SD Negeri Larangan Tokol 1 Pamekasan to enhance student motivation for participating in academic competitions. The study employed a qualitative descriptive approach, utilizing in-depth interviews with educators and administrators, systematic classroom observations, and comprehensive document analysis to gather empirical data. Data collection involved structured interviews with teachers and principals, direct observation of motivational activities, and analysis of school policies and competition records. The findings reveal that the school implements a multi-faceted strategy encompassing personalized approaches by homeroom teachers, systematic talent mapping and identification, provision of adequate supporting facilities, implementation of recognition and reward systems, and intensive mentoring programs tailored to individual student needs. The effectiveness of these strategies is enhanced through collaborative efforts among educators, regular evaluation mechanisms, and adaptive program modifications. Key influencing factors include institutional policies supporting competition participation, individual student interests and abilities, parental support and engagement, and community involvement in educational activities. The research demonstrates that these comprehensive strategies have successfully increased student participation rates in various competitions by 40% and improved overall academic performance, with students showing enhanced confidence and stronger motivation for lifelong learning. The study concludes that integrated motivational strategies when implemented systematically with stakeholder collaboration, create sustainable improvements in student engagement and academic achievement."}}

Through a state-of-the-art vignette experiment, genuine Flemish recruiters evaluated fictitious resumes of school leavers that signalled regional identity through their name, place of birth, residential address, secondary school location, and/or language proficiency. Walloon candidates consistently score lower on key hiring metrics. Structural equation modelling reveals that Flemish employers hold negative perceptions of Walloon candidates, particularly regarding availability, interpersonal competency, attitude, and willingness of employers, employees, and clients to cooperate with them.

We find that longer and more syntactically complex speeches are consistently linked to lower economic confidence and less favorable views of the job climate. Positive sentiment in modal (i.e., policy-relevant) sentences is associated with more optimistic household outlooks.

A key piece of this puzzle is standardization: as regulators increasingly delegate governance to standards development organizations (SDOs) in response to rapid AI innovation, hundreds of potentially overlapping standards proliferate, creating redundancy, organizational confusion, and superficial compliance, while audits and certifications struggle to meaningfully assess adherence. Drawing on an analysis of over 500 AI standards across multiple domains and issuing bodies, this chapter diagnoses five interrelated challenges complicating AI governance: the persistent difficulty of translating contested sociotechnical concepts like fairness, well-being, and transparency into actionable standards; the proliferation of voluntary frameworks with limited enforceability and vague operational guidance; decision paralysis as organizations confront competing and overlapping standards; standards development cycles that lag behind fastmoving AI innovation; and geopolitical competition that fragments international coordination. To address these challenges, the chapter offers a detailed set of institutional design strategies, grounded in current governance practice, for both harmonizing-and humanizing-AI governance. These include fostering deeper coordination among SDOs, supporting satisficing and layered framework adoption tailored to organizational capacity, establishing living standards and rapid-response taskforces to enable adaptive updates, strengthening auditing ecosystems through independent accreditation, transparency, and public reporting, and embedding stakeholder participation directly into governance workflows and organizational implementation processes. Crucially, AI governance must itself be human-centered, designed to be legible, adaptable, and actionable for the real humans responsible for implementing, auditing, and overseeing AI systems."}}

This paper proposes a multi-stage stochastic program to optimize strategic plans for the clean bus fleet transition that explicitly considers the uncertainty scenarios in the cost and efficiency improvements of clean buses. Our optimization model minimizes the total expected cost subject to emission targets, budget restrictions and several other operational considerations. We propose a new forecasting approach that captures the correlation between these improvements to obtain realistic future pathways for Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Buses (HFCBs), which are then given to the multi-stage stochastic program as scenarios. We also utilize a physics-based model for BEBs to accurately capture their energy consumption and recharging needs. As a case study, we focus on the complex public bus network of Istanbul, which aims to transition to a clean bus fleet by 2050. Utilizing real datasets, we solve a five-stage stochastic program spanning a 25-year planning horizon that involves 256 scenarios to obtain dynamic strategic plans that can be used by the policy makers. Our results suggest that BEBs are more advantageous than HFCBs, even in slow BEB but fast HFCB development scenarios. We also conduct several sensitivity analyses to understand the effects of the intermediate emission targets, budget limitations and energy prices."}}

On the one hand, fewer opportunities for household specialization might facilitate their labor force participation. Conversely, they face the same constraints with respect to childcare as married mothers. While aggregate data suggests that single mothers&apos; labor market participation rates are usually higher than those of unmarried women, we argue that this realized labor market equilibrium masks potential demand-side discrimination. To study this, we conduct a correspondence study experiment that involves applying for real jobs using fictitious resumes. We show that equally qualified single mothers are much less likely to receive interview callbacks than unmarried women without children, married without children, and married mothers. For every interview callback, a single mother has to apply to about 30 jobs, whereas an unmarried woman receives more than two callbacks for as many job applications. The callback probability for single mothers is 0.034 p.p. lower in low-DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) firms and 0.048 p.p. lower in high-DEI firms. A key mechanism, the relocation cost channel, where callback differentials are more pronounced for jobs farther from applicants’ home locations, suggests statistical discrimination, which is further corroborated by a vignette study."}}

Unlike generic producers, their developers may be incentivized to compete on more than just price. The technological and commercial peculiarities of biosimilars suggest that they can be a source of innovation, stemming from advances in drug delivery and manufacturing processes. Although these advances fit the definition of incremental innovation, they may produce disruptive effects in niche market segments, thus blurring the line between incremental and disruptive innovation. In addition, the freedom to operate in biosimilar R&amp;D is a key condition enabling manufacturers of biosimilars to potentially expand their business models into the originator segment of the industry and puts originator producers under pressure to innovate preemptively. These innovation-related benefits highlight the importance of identifying a workable antitrust framework for assessing the effects of business strategies that may interfere with pipeline biosimilars. To that end, the article proposes applying the concept of potential competition in existing markets-previously applied to small-molecule markets-to the biopharmaceutical segment. It then discusses several open questions on this adaptation. These include, in particular, the extent to which small market size and regulatory exclusivities may rule out a competitive relationship between incumbents and biosimilar developers; the timeframe for assessing potential biosimilar competition; the features at company level that indicate the capability for a successful biosimilar entry; and the relevant market in which an innovative biosimilar would compete upon commercialization."}}

Combining administrative and survey data at the individual level, we construct a new and unique data set which shows that 20% of the workforce mistakenly think that they work under day contracts, with no monitoring of hours, while they are actually paid through a standard hours contract. This reveals that many workers with various profiles do not know the legal environment governing something as fundamental as their working time. We show that these “ignorant” workers differ from classic workers in terms of working conditions: they perform more unpaid overtime hours but have a higher wage rate per contractual hour, so that their total compensation is similar. Complementary results on job satisfaction also suggest that firms do not take advantage of their workers’ ignorance of labor contracts to extract rents. Rather, “ignorant” workers appear to benefit from an intermediate status between standard hours contracts and day contracts with more flexibility. Leveraging the panel dimension of our data, we further show that these workers are more likely to sign actual day contracts over time, but with smaller effects on their earnings’ trajectories."}}

Through general analysis, via statespace decomposition based on the Brouwer fixed point theorem, several sufficient criteria are obtained to ensure the existence of QJM,K=R,IQni=1(2S iM + 1) equilibrium points(EPs), among which QJM,K=R,IQni=1(S iM + 1) are shown to be locally asymptotically stable, where S iM are nonnegative integers and the set M depends on the number field. These criteria are less restrictive and easier to verify. This paper further estimate the basins of attraction corresponding to stable equilibria. Finally, the theoretical results are supported by two simulated numerical examples."}}

We found that 5.7 Gtons of UFW was generated across 199 countries. By estimating its release upstream and at consumption stage and modelling current waste management practices across regions and food groups, we find that 90% of UFW is released before it reaches consumers, and that almost half of UFW is not valorized, representing a significant loss of potential resources. We identify key regional differences in UFW availability and its current treatment. We highlight these untapped opportunities for more advanced valorization across regions, including bioethanol, biochemicals, and bio-adsorbents, aligned with feedstock availability. The findings support more nuanced, regionally adapted approaches to waste management and bioresource policy, emphasizing UFW as a stable feedstock for circular bioeconomy strategies."}}

We employed the random parameter logit (RPL) model because it addresses the problem of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), no random taste variation, and no correlation in unobserved factors and uses the results to estimate the MWTP and MWTW.

The paper also tries to uncover the perceptions of various stakeholders towards children with disability. Especially the views and narratives of the children, parents and teachers are analyzed to come up with recommendations to improve the conditions of inclusion and access to school education for children with disabilities. The findings of the study are depicted in three sections; the Institutional Arrangements and Policies section deals with the discussion about policies and institutions working in the field of inclusion and welfare of CWD. Similarly, the Perceptions section presents the views of various stakeholders, especially parents, teachers and students with the help of secondary sources like previous research reports. Finally, the Demography section presents the empirical data and synthesis of evidence from various sources like the Census 2021 and Flash I report 2021. The percentage of children with disability in school education was below 1% which indicates the limited access of CWD to education and thus other opportunities. Flash I Report of 2021 issued by CEHRD (2022) presents the number of CWD to be 0.24% of total enrolments in schools, which is 17,219 children with disabilities out of 70,95,435 total children enrolled. The facts derived from Census data and the Flash I report of 2021 clearly show the disparity. Only around 15% of total children with disabilities were enrolled in schools in 2021."}}

The tax attains optimality by balancing income and substitution effects so that individual labor supply is the same for all individuals who work. Individuals can avoid taxation by choosing not to participate in the labor market when their utility would be greater by not working. With this option, the analytic optimal tax incorporates the conditions of the least productive individuals through determination of the extensive margin. Numerical solutions depend on two parameters determined by tax revenue and labor participation constraints. The solutions, with marginal tax rate beginning below zero and monotonically increasing, provide counterexamples to generalizations of published results on optimal income taxation based on alternative assumptions."}}

Our research highlights that firms employ either stringent or flexible internal governance, characterizing two distinct ways that agency and resource-based mechanisms come together to result in environmental performance. In line with institutional theory, we also find that external mechanisms including external sustainability audit and political context (i.e., Republican- or Democratic-learning states) influence the firm’s choices of internal governance configurations. When firms are not monitored by external audit nor experiencing pressures from the political context, we identify that high environmentally performing firms are those that employ stringent governance. Our work implies external audit and political context as key contextual conditions specifying when agency and resource dependence theory become salient in informing the linkage between governance and environmental performance.

This paper examines China&apos;s fiscal decentralization system and its intergovernmental transfer practices, proposing two conditions under which equity-oriented transfer systems may promote economic growth: The effectively motivate local officials&apos; enthusiasm for economic development and the receiving regions&apos; high marginal capital returns. We employ unique fiscal data from China&apos;s county-level economies for the period 2016-2021 to conduct regression analyses. The results show that provinces with more equitable distribution of transfer payments exhibit better economic growth at the county level. However, at the provincial level, there is a non-significant but noteworthy economic loss. This is attributed to the reverse incentives created by the equalization of fiscal transfers, which encourage growth in smaller counties but hinder growth in larger ones. The main mechanisms driving these reverse incentives include insufficient growth potential, distorted fiscal spending preferences, and an over-reliance on transfer payments. Our study demonstrates that, even within China’s unique fiscal system and local development incentives, the allocation of fiscal transfer funds still faces a trade-off between equity and growth. This deepens our understanding of the effectiveness of fiscal transfer systems and the logic of local fiscal operations under a multi-level fiscal governance framework."}}

Harvard, race-based applications of reparations have been criticized as dead on arrival. However, this Article finds that housing-related reparatory policies are dissimilar from affirmative action admissions policies in several ways relevant to the Court's application of strict scrutiny. Housing reparations policies are more in line with historical reparations policies that have withstood strict scrutiny, and they thus represent one comparatively promising avenue through which reparations may yet be achieved. Finally, this Article anchors these findings in possible applications of reparatory policy orientations in housing, connecting existing failures and challenges in housing policy with the myriad possibilities of a reparatory policy orientation."}}

This implies a higher return per dollar of credit for clean energy. While green energy firms face higher initial financing costs, these converge with conventional producers over time. Lower default rates among green energy firms suggest that banks improve credit assessments over time. We also find positive spillovers to other sectors: after a green plant is installed in a county, non-energy firms located in that county experience reduced financing costs and default rates."}}

Despite increased participation in entrepreneurship, women continue to face significant barriers to accessing capital and leveraging digital tools. Findings reveal that financial access is critical for business start-ups and scale-up, yet persistent gender disparities remain. In 2024, women-founded businesses secured only 5.8% of total investments, with female entrepreneurs receiving just 1.8% (£145 million) of the £8 billion in equity investment, while male-led ventures obtained 86% (£6.92 billion). Additionally, the average loan for women-led businesses was £174,000, significantly lower than the £507,000 allocated to maleled enterprises. Barriers to financial access include restrictive institutional financing, gender bias in investment decisions, and inadequate financial inclusion policies. Similarly, digital literacy challenges stem from limited education, lack of mentorship programs, and structural barriers to adopting digital business models. The study integrates Resource-Based Theory, Pecking Order Theory, and Network Affiliation Theory to analyse these challenges and proposes solutions. The study recommendations include institutional financing reforms, enhanced female participation in financial decision-making, and increased involvement of women in developing digital financial tools to foster a more inclusive and sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem."}}

By addressing limitations in recent fully LLM-based methods and traditional bayesian optimization (BO), SLLMBO achieves more robust optimization. This comprehensive benchmarking evaluates multiple LLMs—including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-3.5, and Gemini-1.5-Flash, extending prior work and establishing SLLMBO as the first framework to benchmark a diverse set of LLMs for HPO. By integrating LLMs’ established strengths in parameter initialization with the exploitation abilities demonstrated in this study, alongside TPE’s exploration capabilities, the LLM-TPE sampler achieves a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, reduces API costs, and mitigates premature early stoppings for more effective parameter searches. Across 14 tabular tasks in classification and regression, the LLM-TPE sampler outperformed fully LLM-based methods and achieved superior results over BO methods in 9 tasks. Testing early stopping in budget-constrained scenarios demonstrated competitive performance, indicating that LLM-based methods generally benefit from extended iterations for optimal results. Furthermore, by automating hyperparameter tuning with LLM-driven initialization and adaptive search space refinement, SLLMBO aligns with broader AutoML objectives. Its integration into AutoML pipelines can enhance search efficiency, reduce human intervention, and improve hyperparameter selection strategies in real-world applications. This work lays the foundation for future research exploring open-source LLMs, reproducibility of LLM results in HPO, and benchmarking SLLMBO on complex datasets, such as image classification, segmentation, and machine translation."}}

We seek to identify a policy that maximizes the worst-case ratio of expected reward compared to an oracle (referred to as <i>Pandora</i>) with full knowledge of the value distribution.

Specifically, in industries such as lending and hiring, lenders and employers use platform algorithms to predict candidates' qualifications. We develop a game-theoretic model involving a platform and a firm, the platform can invest in learning to improve algorithm accuracy for better prediction of candidates' qualifications and the firm can decide which candidates to accept by setting score thresholds, whereas the candidates belong to either a regular group or a protected group that is biased against by platform algorithms. Counterintuitively, we show that algorithmic fairness, while seemingly detrimental to firms' profitability due to the constraints it imposes, can actually benefit firms. Interestingly, we find that algorithmic fairness can hurt the protected group or benefit the regular group. Our study also shows that whether equal opportunity or equal treatment outperforms in maximizing firms' profits depends on the benefit-loss ratio. When this ratio is sufficiently high, the firm has higher profits under equal opportunity; otherwise, the firm has higher profits under equal treatment. This study also provides implications for policymakers on when to allow or prohibit the use of sensitive attributes in platform algorithms."}}

Both events exposed systemic failures in corporate governance, financial transparency, and regulatory oversight. In response, reforms such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and post-crisis stimulus programs created a financial environment more favorable to sustainable investments. The paper explores how these shifts led to new market opportunities, with solar companies like First Solar, SolarCity, and Tesla pioneering innovative business models and financial instruments. Tools such as Yieldcos, Green Bonds, and Solar Asset-Backed Securities made solar energy an investable asset class for mainstream capital markets. The paper also draws parallels between Enron's off-balance-sheet accounting tactics and the mortgage-backed securities that fueled the 2008 crisis, highlighting the risks of unchecked financialization. Additionally, the study discusses the role of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in stabilizing the clean energy sector during the Great Recession. A forward-looking analysis addresses emerging risks in ESG investing, cryptocurrency markets, and AIdriven financial systems, underscoring the need for continued vigilance.

This study evaluates the impact of Fairtrade and Organic certification on decent rural employment in Ethiopia&apos;s smallholder coffee sector, focusing on indicators such as wages, contracts, working conditions, training, and job satisfaction. Analyzing data from 560 wage workers across six districts, we utilized Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), and IV Probit models. Results indicate that certification improves job contracts for all workers and increases wages primarily for those in cooperatives, who also gain better access to training on gender equality and child labor prevention. In contrast, household/farm-based workers see minimal benefits due to structural barriers. While working conditions generally improve, job satisfaction rises only moderately among cooperatives, with no significant gains in social integration. A composite decent work index confirms substantial improvements for cooperative workers only, highlighting that VSS effectiveness is heavily influenced by existing organizational capacity. The findings stress the need for context-specific certification frameworks with localized enforcement and targeted training to extend decent work opportunities to marginalized agricultural laborers in developing economies."}}

Existing methods solve this problem by incorporating learnable task-specific parameters. However, this fixed-parameter paradigm often results in suboptimal transfer performance when adapting models from source to diverse target tasks. Our research is inspired by the observation that task-specific parameter configurations exhibit strong correlations with the characteristics of target tasks. We posit that the optimal configuration of task-specific parameters is inherently task-dependent, as an excessive number of such parameters may induce model overfitting, whereas insufficient parameters can impede the model&apos;s adaptability to novel tasks. To exploit the findings, we propose a novel model termed Task-Aware dynamiC rOuting Network (TACO)for cross-domain few-shot learning. During the training phase, TACO employs reinforcement learning to dynamically adjusts the network architecture by considering the discrepancies between the target and source domains. In this way, TACO evaluates the configuration and optimizes an appropriate network configuration for a given task. Furthermore, through the integration of self-attention and knowledge distillation, the feature extraction capability is enhanced, allowing the model to represent more sophisticated visual elements. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conducted experiments on eight cross-domain few-shot classification (FSC) datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TACO outperforms existing methods in terms of average accuracy and generalization ability. Additionally, compared to state-of-the-art results on individual datasets, our approach achieves a performance improvement up to 3.03\\%."}}

Interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics methodology is incorporated, and analysis made of new representative micro data collected from the managers of farms of different types and locations.</span> <span>There has been enormous development in labor supply governance in Bulgarian farms during the last two decades. Permanent employment is a major form of labor supply in farms, followed by seasonal and part-time employment. Owners and family members account for the largest share of the total workforce. Different forms are used (high recurrence of contracts with the same person, output-based compensation, use of service supply or input contracts, etc.) to reduce transaction costs of labor and overall governance of farms. The reasons for using employment contracts and the importance of different labor supply and governance modes, intensity of transactions, types of partners, and kinds of remuneration vary considerably depending on juridical type, size, specialization, and locations of holdings. The most important problems in hiring labor are the lack of labor in the labor market, the high price of hired labor, requirement to pay social payments, pay-holidays, etc., big turnover of workers, high costs for adapting official labor standards, high costs for controlling of hired labor (cheating, stealing, etc.), high costs for negotiating conditions of employment, high costs to find good workers, low qualification of hired labor, advance age of hired labor, requirement for signing a written contract, and insufficient initiatives of workers. For a significant number of Bulgarian farms, the costs of finding and managing hired labor are factors strongly restricting the development of their enterprise. The latter is particularly important for a good proportion of major commercial farms like cooperatives, physical persons, and corporations, to a lesser extent to sole traders.&nbsp; Other critical factors strongly restricting development of Bulgarian farms at present stage of development are: legislation and regulation environment in the country and sector, the amount of costs for finding needed lands and natural resources, amount of costs for finding needed short-term and long-term assets, amount of costs for finding needed finance for the farms, amount of costs for finding needed innovations, amount of costs for marketing of output, amount of costs for&nbsp; registration, certification, etc., existence of informal and gray sector in agriculture, and socio-economic situation in the region and in the&nbsp;country.</span></p>\n<p><span>It has to be periodically used in economic analysis to support public decision making and farm management.

Using a novel suite of integrated models, we generate consistent estimates of emissions, costs, and abatement potential for various production routes (BF-BOF, scrap-EAF, DRI-EAF) in many fuel configurations. Proper system boundary definition is shown to be crucial for a holistic assessment of the total environmental impact of steel production. Our findings show that switching to natural gas-based Direct Reduced Iron (NG-DRI) can cut emissions by approximately 50% compared to the conventional coal-based route, while also enabling stepwise asset renewal and future uptake of biomethane and green hydrogen. Charcoal also offers significant emission reduction opportunities, either in dedicated plants or substituting pulverized coal injection. However, all alternatives face considerable economic, technical, and scalability barriers, necessitating robust policy frameworks to drive the transition. We conclude that NG-DRI represents the most pragmatic bridge to a potential hydrogen-based future, highlighting the value of incremental yet scalable decarbonization strategies."}}

Their importance stems from multifaceted gaps that stem from fulfilled targets ranging from implementation of monetary policy and management reminders including non-performing assets (NPAs). These circulars facilitated bank mergers and acquisitions, eased foreign investment restrictions, lifted barriers on new entrants into various sectors, as well as interest rate controls.&nbsp; The aims of these policies are quite broad. First and foremost, they focus on maintaining stability in the banking sector during times of market turbulence. The other objective is to improve synchronization of the Indian Banking industry with global competition standards which widens strategic expansion opportunities for both Indian Banks and their foreign journeyers.<br><br>The system is not immune to devising ineffective measures however – there exists numerous cases where issuances of circulars went unaddressed or notifications received zero attention outside their intended circles. There have been several notable instances where the Supreme Court has intervened to interpret or challenge RBI circulars, leading to significant legal and regulatory developments. One of the notable cases in this area is “<i>State Bank of India v. Rajesh Agarwal</i>”. This case dealt with natural justice concepts such as the ‘right to be heard’. Another important example is the case of “<i>Dharani Sugars and Chemicals Ltd v Union of India</i>”,&nbsp;where the Supreme Court voided an RBI circular instructing banks to compulsorily commence insolvency proceedings against debtors marked as one-day defaulted loans. As noted by the court, this circular resulted in overstepping predetermined limits by the Reserve Bank of India on its regulating jurisdiction and was deemed as&nbsp;<i>ultra vires</i>. “<i>High Court of Madhya Pradesh v. RBI</i>”&nbsp;is another relevant case. This case pertains to directives concerning merchant trade issued by Reserve Bank of India which were sued upon allegations of being vague as well as excessive scope for could be termed as unregulated expansion drawn over jurisdiction lacking certain borders.<br><br>The legal framework empowering the RBI to issue circulars and notifications is primarily derived from the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and other related statutes.

I decompose this measure into misallocation (1) among superstar firms, (2) among other firms, and (3) between these two groups. I find that only changes in the third component, termed the \"MPK spread\", are negatively priced in the cross-section of stock returns. Stocks with negative exposure to these changes outperform stocks with positive exposure by 4.8% per year. In the long run, a higher MPK spread predicts lower economic growth and aggregate stock returns, while in the short run, it predicts lower innovation growth. Consistent with the ICAPM framework, capital misallocation between superstar and non-superstar firms is a key state variable, and its changes capture a macroeconomic risk factor."}}

It posits that an ecological ceiling above a social foundation creates boundaries within which humans must stay for sustainable economic activity. These boundaries are the doughnut's doughy part. One key claim that is tied to that model is that capitalism/neoliberalism structurally generate imbalances, producing unsustainable and unjust outcomes (i.e., outside the doughnut). We formalize the doughnut model using index numbers bounded between 0 and 1 across environmental and social indicators, and use the coefficient of variation as a measure of structural imbalance. We then test whether higher levels of capitalism — proxied by the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World Index — are associated with greater imbalance. Across multiple datasets (HDI, IHDI, EPI, HPI, Raworth's list), specifications (panel and cross-section), and variable transformations (linear and convex), we find no empirical support for the model’s core prediction. If anything, the sign is often the opposite of the one predicted. Our results do not point to specific policy solutions for environmental or social issues, but they do eliminate one set of proposals from serious consideration: those grounded in the doughnut model. It fails on its own terms and the doughnut is stale.&nbsp;"}}

However, this trend does not render classical algorithms obsolete; rather, it presents opportunities for innovation by integrating beneficial concepts from emerging algorithms into established frameworks. This paper introduces a three-tiered framework comprising focus area localization, search point generation, and global credibility assurance to systematically enhance classical algorithms. Using the genetic algorithm as a case study, it addresses misleading optimization search directions linked to penalty term-based fitness construction by proposing a fitness function based on Lagrange multipliers. This function combines the gradient of the objective function with the gradient vector of the constraints, enabling precise tracking of constraint boundaries. To address search blindness in arithmetic crossover, the solution space is expanded using bipolar vector parameters, resulting in a drop-shaped spatial distribution within the genetic recombination framework. Additionally, a Cauchy-Gaussian bi-distribution perturbation strategy is introduced to prevent premature convergence through gradient-oriented directional searches and adaptive step-size adjustments. This third-order architecture goes beyond the traditional separation of improvements, allowing any algorithmic advancements at different stages to be distilled into standardized modules that can be utilized by other algorithms operating at the same methodological level. The results contribute to a sustainable evolutionary theoretical framework for classical algorithm theory and the dissemination of performance enhancements."}}

Courts, policymakers, and scholars have weighed in on the extent to which agencies should consider cost when creating regulations. The foremost solution that has gained bipartisan support is a two-step process involving a purely science-based risk assessment stage followed by a cost-conscious risk management stage. Congress has found this approach so compelling that some statutes now mandate the process. This Article examines two such statutes—the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Endangered Species Act—and conducts the first forensic analysis of whether this two-step structure actually binds agencies. The investigation reveals that agencies likely “cheat,” and cost considerations contaminate their risk assessments. Consequently, agencies misrepresent risk to the public and undermine their own democratic accountability. The Article next looks to the reasons why an agency might cheat and proposes a triage “step zero” that allows agencies to prioritize risk assessments, conserving resources without deceiving the public."}}

Traditional construction materials like cement and steel are expensive and environmentally damaging, making it critical to explore sustainable alternatives. Bamboo, an abundant and renewable resource in Nepal, presents a promising solution due to its high tensile strength, flexibility, rapid growth, and cost-effectiveness. This paper assesses the current use of bamboo in earthquake-resistant construction, highlighting its mechanical properties, availability, and social acceptance challenges. While bamboo has demonstrated excellent seismic resilience in international case studies, its adoption in Nepal remains limited due to cultural perceptions, lack of technical expertise, and absence of formal building codes. This study identifies opportunities to integrate bamboo into Nepal's national building standards and promotes the potential for bamboo to provide affordable, sustainable housing solutions for disaster-prone regions. With further research, training, and policy support, bamboo could significantly enhance post-disaster reconstruction efforts in Nepal."}}

We also discuss how new markets can lead to novel behaviors or a resurfacing of traditional challenges in finance, highlighting the need for careful research on the implications of these new players.&nbsp;</span>Beyond the direct benefits and consequences for consumers, fintech can have broader impacts on markets, prices, intra-household dynamics, mobility, and even the environment.

In this paper, we survey empirical evidence about the benefits of these innovations, as well as the constraints to scaling and the unintended consequences. Where product innovations have outpaced the production of quality research, we also draw on industry reports and case studies to highlight potential impacts. The benefits of data advances for fintech are numerous. First, they can expand financial access to populations who have been historically excluded due to lack of credit history. Second, large datasets can help financial companies better analyze and mitigate risks, such as through enhanced fraud detection. Third, data can reduce the costs of administration by automating activities like loan approval, insurance payouts, and identity verification, all while boosting accuracy. Fourth, data allows for greater personalization, increasing the appeal of financial products to consumers and improving the ability of tools to meet individual needs. While these technologies hold great promise, to achieve broad scale they require large sources of data. Early algorithmic lending relied heavily on mobile phone data, but increasing restrictions on this data have created a need for alternatives. Skill gaps are also a significant barrier to scale, as many organizations that are interested in applying new data-related innovations currently lack the requisite skills. There are also unintended consequences to consider. First, non-traditional data sources raise concerns about privacy and responsible use of consumer data. Second, expanding credit access might lead to overindebtedness as less educated consumers gain access to borrowing. Third, it is possible for discrimination to be baked into algorithms, though evidence of this in practice is mixed. Finally, consumers might attempt to \"game the system\" by conducting activities favored by algorithms, which in turn reduces algorithmic effectiveness. Further regulation and research can help address many of these concerns. The challenge will be for these mechanisms to keep pace with these novel uses of data.</p>\n</blockquote>"}}

To date, however, little is known about how firms respond to enforcement actions aimed at regulating the relationships they have with their employees. Leveraging a sample of 293 franchisors, in this paper I investigate the spillover effects of the so-called \"No-Poach Initiative,\" an unprecedent enforcement action launched by the Antitrust Division of the State of Washington Attorney General's Office in January 2018. This initiative resulted in 237 franchisors (39 of which are included in my sample) agreeing to remove no-poaching clauses-i.e., provisions in franchise contracts that prohibit franchisees from hiring each other's employees-nationwide. I find that approximately 36 percent of franchisors not targeted by the No-Poach Initiative removed the no-poaching clause from their franchise contract, with this responsiveness unrelated to whether the company operated in the State of Washington. By exploring some of the mechanisms underlying these spillover effects, I present suggestive evidence that the risk of follow-up enforcement actions in other jurisdictions and the common ownership of franchisors by the same parent company may be important factors at play. Lastly, I document a significant relationship between the removal of no-poaching clauses and changes in the use of noncompete and nondisclosure requirements for franchisees' hired managers, suggesting that franchisors more deliberate or invested in employment-related covenants may be more likely to respond to shifts in the regulatory environment. These results underscore the wide-ranging implications of state-led enforcement initiatives and their capacity to shape firms' behavior nationwide, ultimately illustrating that enforcement attempts aimed at altering the use of contractual provisions can function as policy making tools in the labor market."}}

Using annual data from 2013 to 2022 across countries with at least one quantum patent, we find that higher QFI scores are strongly associated with elevated stock market returns, with an economic effect of at least 25.0% annually. However, this innovation premium comes with greater risk, as higher QFI levels also predict increased volatility, averaging 1.8% annually. This is the first empirical study to link quantum innovation to financial market outcomes, providing a foundation for the emerging field of Quantum Finance and offering new insights into how technological frontiers are reshaping global asset pricing."}}

The analysis was structured thematically, focusing on the legal criteria for intervention, the critical role of de-escalation and alternatives, the threshold for \"reasonable force,\" and the unresolved conflict between intervention and patient autonomy. Cases were included if Section 41 was central to the legal reasoning or defence; cases where Section 41 was merely cited in passing without substantive discussion were excluded.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Results: Case law reveals that while Section 41 provides a legal defence, its application is highly context-dependent. Courts have established that force is only justifiable to prevent immediate and unlawful harm, and it must be proportionate to the threat. Crucially, the failure to attempt viable, less-restrictive alternatives (such as de-escalation) can render even minimal force unreasonable. Cases involving excessive force demonstrate a clear judicial focus on proportionality and the availability of other options. The analysis highlights a significant legal and ethical grey area concerning patient capacity and the limits of intervention.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Discussion: The legal framework protecting paramedics is ambiguous and narrowly interpreted.

This study evaluates the distribution and retention mechanisms of heavy metals in coastal sediments of northern Chile, considering different areas (Cifuncho, Paposo, Playa Atacama and Tierra del Morro) and environmental matrices (sediment and soil). The objective of this study is to evaluate the concentration and distribution of heavy metals in sediments of the Taltal commune, considering the influence of the granulometric fraction and physicochemical parameters. Sediment samples from different zones and grain size fractions (2000, 250 and 63 µm) are analyzed. Heavy metal concentrations and physicochemical parameters were determined. ANOVA, boxplots and Pearson correlation matrices were applied. The results show that the Playa Atacama sector has the highest metal load, with high concentrations of Arsenic (72.15 mg/kg), Copper (4576.36 mg/kg), Lead (1841.17 mg/kg), Zinc (388.31 mg/kg) and Mercury (1.94 mg/kg), associated with the presence of mining liabilities in the area. The fine fraction of the sediment (63 µm) concentrated the highest levels of metals in the order of 70 mg/kg for arsenic up to 4500 mg/kg for copper and 1800 mg/kg for lead, standing out as a critical unit for mobility and environmental risk studies. The correlation heat map revealed significant associations (r > 0.90) between metals and parameters such as organic carbon, organic matter, pH and conductivity, suggesting immobilization mechanisms under alkaline and oxidizing conditions. This integrated approach allows for robust characterization and formulation of coastal management plans under anthropogenic pressure."}}

Therefore, we propose A Bayesian Random Semantic Data Augmentation Algorithm (SimKFA), an improved contrastive learning algorithm. A learnable linear transformation layer, KLP, replaces the multilayer perceptron (MLP) to preserve feature information. A feature enhancement module (BFAB), which combines Bayesian inference and frequency-domain feature analysis, is proposed. This module adaptively captures key information, maintains the continuity of the information flow, and reduces feature loss during deep learning. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm prevents loss of feature information caused by the projection head and achieves excellent performance on multiple benchmark datasets."}}

In a laboratory experiment, leaders and followers repeatedly play a weakest-link coordination game, with leaders moving first. When successful coordination yields disproportionately high rewards for leaders, effort is reduced and team performance deteriorates. By contrast, when leaders also bear more substantial strategic risk---in the form of larger losses if coordination fails---team performance initially improves. Leaders appear to trust that assuming such risk will be seen as a motivational act that restores the legitimacy of pay inequality and encourages others to follow. Yet this effect proves difficult to sustain, as coordination often unravels even after the efficient outcome has been reached. We conclude that while risk-based legitimacy can support coordination under inequality, the greater challenge lies in sustaining it."}}

In an online survey experiment on 4,400 representative respondents from Italy, participants are exposed to a real-world flooding scenario and randomly assigned to information treatments portraying institutions as effective, ineffective, or neither of the two. When institutions are framed as effective, institutional trust and donations to a grassroots environmental NGO increase, while social trust and cooperation norms remain stable. When institutions are seen as unprepared, participants do not compensate by trusting others or stressing cooperation. Instead, they increase support for the NGO as well, suggesting crisis management delegation to motivated and organised citizens. When no information is provided about institutional quality all trust indicators rise, albeit more noisily. These findings suggest delegation as a distinct response to institutional failure and point to the need to study trust in civic movements as an intermediate form between institutional and interpersonal trust."}}

We compare two conditions in which both let participants face the voluntary contribution task over a finite number of rounds: one implements it as a static game (Baseline condition), and the other implements it as a dynamic game with four successive stages of simultaneous contribution choices within each round (Milestone condition). Our data show that cooperation in the Baseline condition is rare and mostly limited to the first few rounds. The evidence for the Milestone condition is much more encouraging: contributions beyond suffering are substantial and fairly stable across rounds, although full contributions remain rare. This evidence suggests that the Milestone protocol is a promising institutional device for enhancing voluntary cooperation."}}

The representation of women in leadership positions serves as a measure of gender equality. Empowering women in leadership facilitates inclusive economic growth and allows organisations to have a diversified talent pool. Women continue to be significantly underrepresented in strategic leadership roles within manufacturing pharmaceutical companies (MPCs) operating in South Africa, despite ongoing efforts to promote gender equity. This study aimed to assess the presence of women in board and executive leadership positions and propose strategies to promote gender-inclusive leadership. A systematic desktop review was conducted to analyse the websites and annual reports of 49 publicly listed MPCs that were selected from the South African Pharmacy Council (SAPC) 2021 register. The data were collected on company characteristics, leadership composition, gender distribution and professional qualifications of leaders within each company. The results revealed that women comprised only 29.48% of board members and 27.36% of executive leaders, with female pharmacists representing just 28.1% of leadership positions. Statistical analysis, including Chi-square tests, confirmed a gender disparity, with men significantly more likely to occupy strategic roles. The findings highlighted barriers such as unconscious bias, exclusion from influential networks, limited mentorship and sponsorship opportunities and challenges related to work-life balance. The study concludes that addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach, including structured sponsorship programs, gender-inclusive leadership policies, targeted talent development initiatives and corporate accountability measures. By implementing these strategies, pharmaceutical companies can create a more equitable leadership environment for women to enhance decision-making, innovation and long-term sustainability of the pharmaceutical industry."}}

Within the healthcare context, this theory predicts that fairer wages for healthcare workers will incentivize them, resulting in higher-quality patient care. The positive effect of pay transparency on patient satisfaction is more significant for hospitals in Democratic states and in states where the hospital industry has a larger gender-based pay gap. The positive effect is also more evident in less profit-driven hospitals and in those that exhibit a higher labor intensity. Overall, we offer novel evidence that workers' pay transparency has a positive transmission effect on customer satisfaction."}}

In this study, a combined depressant system comprising polyaspartic acid (PASP) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) was systematically investigated to achieve efficient separation. Micro-flotation tests, contact angle experiments, atomic force microscopy (AFM), surface adsorption analysis, Zeta potential characterization, and local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (LEIS) were carried out to elucidate the selective inhibition mechanism. Results of the flotation tests showed that recovery of the chalcopyrite remained 94.25%, but recovery of the arsenopyrite distinctly decreased to 19.80% after the addition of depressants. Testing results of the contact angle and AFM indicated that the depressant can selectively adsorbed on the surface of arsenopyrite and increased the hydrophilicity. The results of surface adsorption amount tests and Zeta potential measurement illustrated that the depressant could greatly hinder collector adsorb on the arsenopyrite surface, but have little effect on the chalcopyrite. The results of LEIS tests presented that the component of Na2S mainly hindered the adsorption of collector and the PASP further interacted with the arsenopyrite surface, finally resulting in an improvement of hydrophilicity. A mechanistic schematic was proposed to illustrate the synergistic roles of PASP-copper ions chelation and site competition of Na2S with collector. These findings advance the fundamental theory for environmentally sustainable separation of copper-arsenic sulfide minerals."}}

Leveraging these advanced tools, we find that firms with less talented CEOs and poor performance are more inclined to learn from their peers. Firms with better governance also show a greater propensity to emulate their peers. Moreover, firms facing severe financial constraints are particularly vulnerable to predatory peer behaviors, increasing their likelihood of imitation. Our findings remain robust across alternative network identification strategies, including endogenous selection of peers and traditional instrumental variable analysis utilizing the adoption of Universal Demand (UD) laws as an exogenous source of variation to identify the causal peer effect."}}

Using unique data with global coverage, we find: (1) BSLs increase the RMB's share in trade finance by 6% without significantly reducing the dollar's share; (2) categorizing BSLs by publicly stated objectives and activation clauses shows Type I BSL (trade-focused) has no impact on the dollar, whereas Type II BSL (trade and financial stability-focused) reduces the dollar's share by 3%; (3) Type II BSLs drive RMB adoption by improving offshore RMB accessibility and lowering RMB funding costs, enabling it to compete directly with US dollar.

This paper suggests that these challenges may be addressed by asking whether and how the structure, function and dynamics of complex organisms are analogous to those of economies. Aligning with educational and scientific standards in biology, we explore this question by comparing the structure, function, and dynamics of economies against an established standard by which scientists distinguish living from non-living systems: the eight, well-established characteristics of complex organisms: Hierarchical Organization (HO), Metabolism, Homeostasis, Response to Environmental Stimuli, Growth and Development, Reproduction, Evolutionary Adaptation, and Order. To identify deep, structural-functional parallels – rather than flexibly-interpreted metaphorical similarities – we apply the formal criteria of structure-mapping theory which underlie the cognitive alignment process that drives scientific model-building. This analysis suggests that economies are not just metaphorically similar to organisms, but that the properties, principles or laws underlying the structure and abilities of complex organisms apply to economies. More simply, although economies may not resemble complex organisms in appearance, they are organized and function as if they are. This supports shifting from the mechanistic to a biological paradigm. Importantly, shared characteristics – particularly with respect to HO – may enhance the conceptual clarity of vague ecological metaphors, offering potentially a novel, scientifically grounded framework for understanding economies in terms of the structure, function, and dynamics complex organisms. The paper concludes with limitations and directions for future research."}}

Guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Economics, and based on China's comprehensive industrial chain advantages and the enabling conditions of digital technologies, this paper proposes the theory of \"dynamic anchoring of a basket of core commodities\" and the collaborative system of \"Advanced Planned Economy\". This theory selects 1,000 core commodities covering over 90% of the national economic output value, anchors currency issuance to their total value, and dynamically adjusts weights relying on the three-dimensional model of \"commodity scarcity-demand elasticity-industrial correlation\", forming a logical closed-loop of \"physical value anchoring - dynamic quantitative regulation - upgrading of governance efficiency\". The technical support system includes a core commodity database (full-chain data penetration), a dynamic weight algorithm (supercomputing-driven real-time iteration), and a digital currency layer (targeted regulation tool), realizing the governance balance of \"macro-level orientation without overstepping, micro-level vitality without disorder\". Practice shows that this system narrowed the deviation between the growth rates of money supply and physical wealth from 3.2 percentage points to 1.5 percentage points during 2018-2023, with the CPI volatility decreasing by 40%. It also provides a Chinese solution for breaking the US dollar hegemony and building a global pluralistic governance order. This innovation develops the digital expression of the labor theory of value in Marxist political economy, breaks through the dual opposition between planning and market, and contributes a new paradigm to the economic theory of scientific socialism in the digital era.\n</div>\n<div>\n Definition of Core Concepts\n</div>\n<div>\n 1.Advanced Planned Economy: Refers to an economic governance form enabled by digital technologies, which achieves \"controllable macro proportions + autonomous micro decisions\" through dynamic monitoring of core commodities and algorithm-based collaborative regulation. Its core feature is relying on full-domain monitoring of the Internet of Things (coverage rate 98.7%) and supercomputing power support, converting national regulatory goals into dynamic weight signals rather than mandatory interventions. It is distinct from the administrative quota model of traditional planned economy, and essentially represents a collaborative paradigm of \"effective market + proactive government\" in the digital era.[ Referencing Ostrom, E. (2015) \"Polycentric Governance\" theory, which emphasizes that multiple subjects achieve collaborative governance through information sharing, this paper further transforms \"decentralized knowledge\" into \"centralized wisdom\" through digital technologies.]\n</div>\n<div>\n 2.Physical Credit Community: A currency cooperation mechanism based on mutual recognition of regional core commodity reserves and data sharing. Its credit foundation is \"total commodity volume + technical endorsement\". By building cross-regional commodity pools (e.g., RCEP palm oil and rubber reserves) and cross-border data platforms, it realizes the rigid binding of currency settlement and physical value, freeing from dependence on the sovereign credit of a single country, and providing a technical path to solve the \"trilemma of reserve currency\".[ Drawing on Triffin, R. (1960) \"Triffin Dilemma\" which critiques the flaws of sovereign currencies, this paper replaces sovereign credit with physical credit to build a decentralized cross-border cooperation network.<span>]</span>\n</div>"}}

My analysis identifies key pathways through which public ownership can shape TAI development, mitigate economic volatility, and distribute AI-derived wealth more equitably. I assess the design tradeoffs of ownership models, from minority stakes to majority control, and highlight political and institutional constraints on implementation. By comparing SWFs’ potential to that of laissez-faire or purely regulatory approaches, I argue that SWFs offer a flexible, scalable tool for democratic states to retain strategic influence over TAI while preserving fiscal legitimacy. I conclude by outlining scenarios under which SWFs may succeed or fail, providing a structured framework for policymakers to evaluate this institutional lever in managing the AI transition."}}

To estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) and flexibly account for a high-dimensional set of covariates, we apply the double-debiased machine learning (DDML) approach combined with stacked generalisation. Our findings confirm that women are more likely to be over-educated, while men are more likely to be over-skilled, in line with previous literature.

Long-term monitoring efforts around the world are faced with rising survey costs and a more uncertain future, as environmental variability is projected to increase. Together, these pressures necessitate more efficient sampling designs. In this study, we use information theory (Fisher Information) to evaluate and optimize life-history sampling, focusing on how variation in fish growth or maturation can guide more informed sampling decisions. Fisher Information is closely related to variance, in that samples with higher information result in greater precision. Using life-history parameters from eight commercially important groundfish species assessed on the U.S. West Coast, we develop three case studies illustrating how sampling strategies can be improved using Fisher Information. The first example focuses on estimating maturity ogives in the absence of spatial and temporal variability; our second case study incorporates spatial and temporal variation, and the third adds a second life-history trait (growth) to jointly optimize sampling for maturity. Our results indicate that for informing maturity ogives, Fisher Information is maximized at lengths near the inflection point, and that the range of most informative lengths can shift across space and time due to habitat or environmental variation. When both growth and maturation are considered, optimal sampling windows broaden for some species but remain narrow for others. Our simulation results also show that sampling fish in proportion to Fisher Information, rather than random sampling, can reduce sampling effort by more than 50% while maintaining or improving the precision of parameter estimates. While the benefits of using Fisher Information are species specific, these findings suggest that adaptive sampling based on Fisher Information can substantially increase the efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring programs, especially under budgetary or logistical constraints."}}

This study aims to identify different profiles of people based on their awareness of the decline in bee populations and the importance of these pollinators. A non-probabilistic sampling design was used through an online survey conducted in Italy with 380 participants aged 21–75. The survey adapted the General Awareness of Consequences (GAC) scale and included measures of the relevance of bees for Ecosystem Services (ES). The segmentation process identified three distinct groups, with no significant differences in sociodemographic profiles. The “Absolutists” segment emerged as the most deeply engaged with the issue of pollinator decline. The “Anthropocentrists”, for whom perceived benefits for human life primarily drive their concern for bee conservation. Finally, the “Ecocentrists” are characterised by a worldview based on a moral responsibility extended to all living beings rather than solely to humans. The findings provide valuable insights to enhance communication, increase awareness, and promote conservation actions. The results provide practical recommendations for public institutions and policymakers to develop targeted strategies that address knowledge gaps and encourage conservation efforts."}}

The effects of recovering varying amounts of CO2 from the reformer stack (i.e., 5–25 ton/h) and injecting it under two scenarios (to the reformer feed gas vs. synthesis feed gas) on methanol yield, utility consumption, and emissions were investigated. The optimal capacity of 15 t/h was chosen for maximizing methanol production. The economic assessment included capital and operating costs, while the environmental assessment comprehensively evaluated net CO2 emissions. However, the total required excess energy for solvent regeneration and compression was 2,708 kW of electricity, 45 tons of low-pressure steam, and 3,270 tons of cooling water, corresponding to a 15 t/h CO2 recovery. Moreover, an environmental analysis reveals a paradox: while CO2 recovery reduces direct stack emissions, the indirect emissions from utility services result in a net increase in CO2 output. The CO2 intensity per ton of methanol rises by 20–26% compared to the base case design."}}

As ecological economists have challenged this assumption, exploring public opinion on possible tradeoffs between the environment and the economy is critical. Until now, most research investigating these tradeoffs has been primarily conducted in Global North countries, mainly in Europe. We elevate this to a global level by analyzing data for 92 countries from the World Values Survey, particularly how people&apos;s prioritization relates to demographic and socio-economic factors. The results show that a majority of the global population prioritizes environmental protection over economic growth (60.07%), especially in high-income countries in the Americas, Western Europe, and Oceania, but also in Southeast Asia. Surprisingly, we can show significant differences in the influence of demographic and socio-economic factors on people&apos;s level of environmental support. In the global average and a majority of countries, stronger environmental support is held by more educated people, those leaning politically to the left, females, and younger people. Income is shown not to have a significant effect on the global scale. However, our results indicate a broad diversity across countries in how all these variables influence the prioritization between the environment and the economy. Especially in non-Western countries, the often-assumed factors do not play out as expected. Overall, these results suggest that there should be a general openness for an economic system that places greater value on the environment and less on economic growth, such as degrowth."}}

Clearly, if participation implies a meaningful redistribution of power, its implications become especially relevant for understanding how decisions are made, by whom, and in whose interests. However, existing governance principles for natural resource management (NRM) have overlooked the influence of varying degrees of participation in their achievement. This paper explores the relationship between rungs of participation and the realization of NRM governance principles. Drawing on peer-reviewed literature case studies from diverse NRM contexts, it uses a structured framework of ascending participation rungs to compare how varying shapes of participation – from passive information sharing to full decision-making authority – influence governance outcomes. The analysis shows that lower rungs of participation generally offer limited support for effective governance. Mid-range rungs, where stakeholders influence agenda-setting and implementation, emerge as a threshold where participation begins to meaningfully affect governance outcomes. At the highest rungs, participation can enhance governance for NRM but may also generate trade-offs if institutional capacity is weak and coordination challenges arise. This analysis opens room for discussion on the shift from environmental governance to governance for sustainability, where citizen’s inputs are increasingly asked and the social and economic dimensions are considered besides the environmental one. Rather than treating participation as inherently beneficial, it highlights the conditions under which it can strengthen or undermine effective governance, inviting further reflection on the design and support of participatory process in complex environmental settings."}}

Based on a purposive sample of 138 grey literature documents published between 2018 and 2023, we examine how gender is framed across energy subsystems (political, economic, socio-ecological, and technological) and across multiple levels of analysis—from household to global. Our findings show that while economic and socio-ecological concerns are commonly addressed, technological domains remain largely gender-blind. Gender is often reduced to “women,” with limited intersectional analysis.

Using a mixed-methods approach, it analyzes tourism trends. It engages with Indigenous voices to examine how tourism shapes environmental values through the lens of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) valuation framework and Aníbal Quijano’s theory of coloniality of power. The findings reveal a dynamic interplay between intrinsic, relational, and instrumental values of nature, with tourism fostering both opportunities for cultural revitalization and risks of cultural commodification. Indigenous communities articulate deep relational connections with nature, particularly the Amazon River, which tourism often reconfigures through capitalist and Western lenses. While community-based tourism can act as a vehicle for decolonial praxis and environmental stewardship, the predominance of corporate tourism models and weak governance structures perpetuates extractive legacies and marginalizes Indigenous worldviews.

Identifying sustainable financing mechanisms that align with public preferences is critical for long-term conservation efforts. This study evaluates public preferences for wetland conservation in Malaysia using choice experiments with tax and donation as monetary attributes. Data was collected using a quantitative research approach through face-to-face interviews with the public within the wetland areas. Economic analyses and modeling were conducted using BIOGEME software to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) and assess the influence of payment mechanisms. The results of Mixed Logit Model reveal that the price coefficient as a measure of sensitivity to conservation costs is remarkably similar across the two mechanisms. While the marginal WTP from the donation is slightly higher (RM42.80/ month) than the payment using tax (RM35.30/month). This finding suggests that the monetary valuation of wetlands is consistent regardless of the payment method, underscoring the universal recognition of their intrinsic value. These quantitative responses and contextual factors highlight the importance of public trust, perceived fairness, and ease of implementation in determining the viability of each funding mechanism. The study concludes that a hybrid or alternative approach leveraging both voluntary (donation) and mandatory (tax) contributions could enhance funding resilience while addressing diverse stakeholder preferences. These insights contribute to the discourse on sustainable financing for biodiversity conservation in developing countries."}}

Utilizing over 60,000 real crash cases provided by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), we quantitatively analyzed key variables such as collision speed, impact location, vehicle type, and road surface condition to derive corresponding probability distributions. Through the application of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Smoothed Probabilities, we established a reliable probabilistic framework. Subsequently, we employed the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) technique to generate 30 virtual crash scenarios that ensure both representativeness and diversity. The proposed methodology enables scenario-based analyses that effectively capture the uncertainty and variability of real-world collisions. It offers substantial utility in diverse domains such as vehicle structural analysis, design optimization, and traffic safety policy development."}}

This study evaluates local community willingness in conserving Kafta-Sheraro National Park, focusing on their willingness to contribute through financial support or labor to help mitigate these challenges. Using data from 384 local residents, the study gathered insights on perceived threats and conservation trends. Most respondents reported severe habitat degradation caused by agricultural expansion, illegal logging, and grazing. Majority (88.8%) the participants supported for the proposed conservation plan, with 72.43% preferring labor contributions and 27.57% opting for monetary support. Probit and biprobit models were used to analyze the determinants of respondents’ preferences and willingness to accept the offered bids. Ethnicity, residence conditions, livestock ownership, and income from forest products significantly influenced their decisions. Those with previous conflicts regarding conservation were less likely to support for the proposed plan. Households willing to contribute financially showed an average annual willingness to pay (WTPM) of 1,362.24 birr (approximately US$40.40), while those favoring labor contributions were willing to offer an average of 30 labor days per year. When aggregated across kebeles adjacent to the park, total contributions were estimated at 5,632,519 birr (US$166,988.41) and 325,929 labor days annually. These results emphasize the need to integrate community participation into conservation planning. By recognizing local willingness and addressing socio-economic factors, park management can build sustainable, inclusive strategies that benefit both the ecosystem and surrounding communities."}}

Nevertheless, CO2 emissions from NGCC still contribute to environmental degradation, necessitating the integration of CO2 capture technologies. Dry-sorbent CO2 capture, in particular, offers advantages such as compact plant design, reduced corrosion, and lower energy consumption. However, its economic and environmental performance has not been extensively investigated. In this study, two dry-sorbent CO2 capture processes were developed, employing vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) and temperature swing adsorption (TSA), respectively. The levelized costs of CO2 capture were determined to be 76.4 USD per ton and 73.3 USD per ton for VSA and TSA, respectively. Furthermore, global warming potential was reduced by 45% and 49% for VSA and TSA, respectively, corresponding to annual reductions of 827 × 103 and 908 × 103 tons of CO2 eq. These results indicate that TSA is the more economically and environmentally advantageous option. The electricity consumption of blowers, driven by pressure drop, was identified as a major factor influencing both economic and sustainability outcomes. The insights from this study may serve as guidelines for the commercialization and optimization of the dry-sorbent CO2 capture process."}}

More precisely, we are interested in the influence of socioeconomic determinants on the likelihood of using public transport more often following the introduction of a free travel measure. We investigate changes in travel behavior at the individual level, using data from the household travel survey (Cerema Certified Mobility Survey EMC²) conducted in the metropolitan area of Clermont-Ferrand in 2023. We built a weighted binary logistic regression to estimate the probability that users increase their public transport use due to the fare-free policy, depending on their socioeconomic characteristics. Results highlight an increase in public transport use for over 50% of users, mainly for shopping, leisure, and family and friends visiting. In addition, our analysis indicates that the impacts of free travel vary according to individual characteristics. In Clermont-Ferrand, low-income households, residents of priority urban districts, and families with children benefit more from the fare-free policy. Fare-free public transport eliminates tariff and non-tariff barriers to the public transport network on weekends, which may deter modest households from traveling or participating in solidarity pricing schemes. We also demonstrate that residing in an urban priority district (QPV) has a specific impact. Therefore, there could be a socioeconomic neighborhood effect beyond the composition effect. This study intends to contribute to the literature on free public transport policy evaluation, with a focus on the socioeconomic heterogeneity of effects."}}

Consequently, policies as well as strategies related to adoption and level of adoption of improved potato varities can influence these different factors in order to boost growers&apos; acceptance."}}

Using panel data on Chinese A-share listed manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2022, we find that a one standard deviation increase in monetary policy uncertainty (0.397) reduces the likelihood of digital transformation by at least 15%. Relative to the sample mean of digital transformation (1.269), this effect corresponds to an 11.8% decline. We identify four mechanisms driving this effect: reduced corporate risk appetite, lower cash holdings, curtailed R&D investment, and heightened financing costs. The results withstand alternative specifications, instrumental variable analysis, and extensive tests for endogeneity and heterogeneity. Importantly, the observed effects are not confounded by political, regulatory, and institutional uncertainties. Our findings underscore the importance of stabilising monetary policy to foster firm-level digital innovation."}}

The goal is to develop better heating and fluid movement in medicine, especially in hyperthermia and drug delivery, where exact control over how heat moves is important. By applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and the Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM) to the governing equations for mass, momentum and energy conservation, we get solutions that are both semi-analytical and highly accurate. It is seen from key results that boosting the magnetic parameter (M = 0.5–2.0) leads to a 30% decrease in the average flow, while facilitating much better temperature spread. Compared to Ti_{6}Al_{4}V (φ1 = 0.05–0.2), ZnO (φ2 = 0.05–0.2) is found to have better thermal performance, since ZnO has slightly lower conductivity. If both thermal radiation (Rd is 0.1–0.5) and viscous dissipation (Ec is 0.01–0.1) are considered, they raise temperatures and boost heat transfer efficiency. Results for four curves are found to be within 1% of the existing numerical data (Table 4). The results suggest that ternary hybrid nanofluids, enhanced with Ti6Al4V, exhibit useful advantages in biomedicine due to their balance of heat transfer and fluid motion. Studies should concentrate on testing and reviewing how well these resins can be used in actual medical settings."}}

By using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a three-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with carbon social cost, the results demonstrate significant inter-provincial heterogeneity: Jiangsu excels in carbon mitigation performance, yet displays heightened sensitivity to subsidy cuts; the eco-efficiency paradox observed in Anhui where ecological benefits coexist with systemic inefficiencies unveils a resource misallocation trap; Zhejiang’s innovation intensity contrasts with intra-regional imbalances; and Shanghai leverages managerial strengths despite spatial and land-use constraints. Scenario analyses show that a 50% tariff imposition reduces export-oriented efficiency by 4.9%; carbon border measures disrupt scale optimization, and subsidy phase-outs expose structural weaknesses of the PV industry. These findings underscore the adaptive resilience of YRD’s PV industry while exposing persistent structural inefficiencies, necessitating region-specific policies, R&D alignment, and cross-regional synergies to sustain China’s PV leadership in a shifting global trade landscape."}}

These household responses are driven by speeches from regional presidents, likely due to greater visibility in regional media coverage.

Using Demographic and Health Survey data and exploiting the staggered rollout of FPE across 17 countries, we find that FPE reduces fertility by 0.1 children per woman and improves child survival and school enrollment. Linking these data with ethnic-level cultural norms of male dominance, we find that these effects are concentrated among ethnic groups with low male dominance, while high male-dominance groups experience minimal or opposing effects. We further show that FPE strengthens women’s bargaining power in low male-dominance settings, as evidenced by increased contraceptive use, greater influence over reproductive decisions, and higher participation in household decision-making. These changes are accompanied by higher labor force participation, increased media engagement, a higher probability of divorce, and reduced tolerance for intimate partner violence. Such shifts are largely absent in high-male dominance cultures. These findings are consistent with a simple theoretical framework that integrates the canonical quantity–quality trade-off into a household bargaining model with limited commitment, where cultural norms are captured by the extent of women’s veto power over fertility decisions. Our results highlight the critical role of cultural norms in shaping the effects of policy interventions on fertility behavior and broader development outcomes."}}

On the expenditure side, current spending – especially public wages and interest payments – also exerts a stabilising influence. We further provide new estimates of output losses from the two most severe recent recessions in the EU27 – the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic – and find evidence that the severity of these losses may be linked to the scale of the government, both before and after the crises."}}
