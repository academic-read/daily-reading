I exploit state-level variation across time in the existence of red flag laws between 1990 and 2018 and find that the existence of a risk-based law reduces firearm-related suicides by 6.4% and overall suicides by 3.7%, with no substitution to non-firearm suicides. Red flag laws are not associated with a statistically significant change in homicides rates. Policymakers should consider red flag laws an effective tool to prevent firearm-related suicide, one of the most prevalent preventable causes of death in the United States. In light of this evidence, red flag laws should be more politically successful in the current partisan environment than other forms of gun control legislation because of their targeted nature and potential to balance the interests of gun owners against the negative externalities of gun violence."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ea2\u65d7\u6cd5\u6848\uff08\u5141\u8bb8\u4ece\u6709\u81ea\u6b8b\u6216\u4f24\u5bb3\u4ed6\u4eba\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4eba\u624b\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6536\u67aa\u652f\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u81ea\u6740\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u51f6\u6740\u7387\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ea2\u65d7\u6cd5\u6848\u4f7f\u67aa\u652f\u76f8\u5173\u81ea\u6740\u51cf\u5c116.4%\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u81ea\u6740\u51cf\u5c113.7%\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u67aa\u652f\u81ea\u6740\u66ff\u4ee3\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e94\u5c06\u7ea2\u65d7\u6cd5\u6848\u89c6\u4e3a\u9884\u9632\u67aa\u652f\u76f8\u5173\u81ea\u6740\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "research_question": "\u7ea2\u65d7\u6cd5\u6848\u5bf9\u81ea\u6740\u7387\u548c\u51f6\u6740\u7387\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ea2\u65d7\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u67aa\u652f\u62e5\u6709\u8005\u6743\u76ca\u4e0e\u67aa\u652f\u66b4\u529b\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u81ea\u6740\u548c\u51f6\u6740\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75281990\u5e74\u81f32018\u5e74\u95f4\u5dde\u7ea7\u7ea2\u65d7\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u7ea2\u65d7\u6cd5\u6848\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u67aa\u652f\u76f8\u5173\u81ea\u6740\uff086.4%\uff09\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u81ea\u6740\uff083.7%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u51f6\u6740\u7387\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u5e72\u9884\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5728\u81ea\u6740\u9884\u9632\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u7ea2\u65d7\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u9632\u67aa\u652f\u76f8\u5173\u81ea\u6740\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Ethiopia has experienced recurrent food price shocks, often associated with global trends, domestic supply constraints and policy changes. However, limited empirical research has assessed the impact of these shocks on vulnerable populations, particularly, children. We employ the Fourier-based Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (FA-ARDL) model on time series data to capture both short-run and long-run effects, while accounting for potential structural breaks and cyclical variations. Our findings indicate that rising food price However, the study has several limitations. The reliance on available data may affect the generalizability of the findings, as the specific context of Ethiopia may not represent other countries. Additionally, the study does not account for other potential variables that could influence under-five child mortality, such as environmental factors, cultural practices, and healthcare quality. The models used, while robust, may not capture all the complexities of the relationships between variables. The use of FA-ARDL bounds testing, while powerful, has limitations in terms of its assumptions and potential biases. Furthermore, the study's time frame and data availability may not fully reflect long-term trends and changes. Future research should consider incorporating a broader range of variables, different methodological approaches, and longer time frames to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the determinants of child mortality. significantly increase under-five mortality, suggesting that food price instability has extensive health implications for children. Conversely, improvements in economic growth, government effectiveness, and reductions in out-of-pocket health expenditures were correlated with lower child mortality rates over time. These results underscore the importance of stabilizing food prices and strengthening institutions that ensure households' access to food and health services. We contend that integrated strategies, combining food system resilience, social protection, and investment in public health infrastructure, are crucial for reducing child mortality in low-income settings. By linking food price dynamics to child health outcomes from an econometric perspective, this study contributes to the expanding body of literature at the intersection of food security, governance, and human development. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in Ethiopia and similar contexts facing the dual challenges of economic volatility and health vulnerability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e861970\u5e74\u81f32020\u5e74\u95f4\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u3001\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e94\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u653f\u5e9c\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u81ea\u4ed8\u533b\u7597\u8d39\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u5236\u5ea6\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u3001\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u4e94\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff1f", "motivation": "\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u9891\u7e41\u7ecf\u5386\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u5065\u5eb7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u5e03\u6ede\u540e\uff08FA-ARDL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff1b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u6548\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u964d\u4f4e\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u7b49\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u516c\u5171\u5065\u5eb7\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Yet <i>Trump v. United</i> <i>States</i> seems ready to place presidents entirely or largely above the law by granting them absolute or near\u2011absolute immunity from criminal prosecutions for official conduct. And <i>Trump</i> is not a one-off: from judicial recusal to qualified immunity to due process decisions, the Court frequently seems to display indifference to values of accountability and impartiality that have long been thought integral to the rule of law. What is going on?</span></p>\n<p><span>We call this puzzle \u201cthe Roberts Court Paradox\u201d This Essay explains how the Court arrived at this untenable position and what has led it astray. Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s famous essay <i>The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules</i> provides our starting point. It argues that judges who wish to remain true to the rule of law must aspire to decide cases by formulating bright-line rules instead of nuanced rules, standards, or balancing tests. At the core of this argument are two ideas, both facially plausible. First, bright-line rules provide individuals with fair notice of what the law is and what sanctions they face. Second, they promise to prevent appellate judges from reading their own values into the law and thereby usurping the powers of other branches. We show that the Roberts Court is where it is in large part because of this equation of the rule-of-law with bright-line rules.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, Justice Scalia\u2019s argument withers under scrutiny, and it is especially weak as applied to constitutional interpretation undertaken by the Supreme Court. This is not only because it entirely fails to consider the centrality of accountability and equality before the law, which are both foundational to the rule of law. It is also because Justice Scalia\u2019s \u2018notice\u2019 and \u2018limited power\u2019 arguments are far from compelling. While the value of notice is indeed critical in areas such as criminal law, it is much less important in constitutional law, which is primarily about power-conferring and power-constraining rules, not about sanctioning individuals for violating duty-imposing rules. And while judicial usurpation of power is indeed a rule-of-law issue, it is pure dogma to suppose that sticking to bright-line rules is the only approach that can keep judges in their lane. More importantly, Supreme Court justices who create bright-line rules that block accountability for other branches of government are plainly abandoning the core value of limited powers, not protecting it.&nbsp; In sum: the Roberts Court, following Justice Scalia\u2019s lead, has allowed a fondness for bright lines to overwhelm its duty to acknowledge the foundational place of accountability in the Anglo\u2011American legal tradition.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7f57\u4f2f\u8328\u6cd5\u9662\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u63a8\u5d07\u6cd5\u6cbb\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u6717\u666e\u8bc9\u7f8e\u56fd\u6848\u7b49\u6848\u4ef6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u6f20\u89c6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u201c\u7f57\u4f2f\u8328\u6cd5\u9662\u6096\u8bba\u201d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u65af\u5361\u5229\u4e9a\u5927\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u201c\u89c4\u5219\u4e4b\u6cd5\u201d\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5c06\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u5982\u4f55\u56e0\u6b64\u504f\u79bb\u6cd5\u6cbb\u6838\u5fc3\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f57\u4f2f\u8328\u6cd5\u9662\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u63a8\u5d07\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u6f20\u89c6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7f57\u4f2f\u8328\u6cd5\u9662\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6cd5\u6cbb\u4f20\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8bef\u533a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u65af\u5361\u5229\u4e9a\u5927\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u300a\u89c4\u5219\u4e4b\u6cd5\u300b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u660e\u786e\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u5224\u4f8b\u548c\u65af\u5361\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u660e\u786e\u89c4\u5219\u7406\u8bba\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5baa\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f57\u4f2f\u8328\u6cd5\u9662\u504f\u79bb\u6cd5\u6cbb\u6838\u5fc3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6279\u5224\u4e86\u5c06\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8bef\u533a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u6743\u529b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6cd5\u6cbb\u6838\u5fc3\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u5224\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u6cd5\u6cbb\u4f20\u7edf\u3002"}}

Understanding the differential impacts of these price fluctuations on boys and girls is crucial for formulating equitable nutrition policies. Although numerous studies have explored the relationship between food prices and child nutrition, there is limited evidence regarding gender-specific impacts and the underlying factors contributing to disparities in Ethiopia. This study examines the effects of food price changes on the nutritional status of children in Ethiopia, with particular emphasis on gender disparities in malnutrition. Utilizing data from five rounds of the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), we employed anthropometric indicators and the Minimum Acceptable Diet (MAD) measure to evaluate child nutrition and applied the Fairlie nonlinear decomposition method to quantify and elucidate gender differences in nutritional outcomes. The results indicate that male children are more susceptible to malnutrition than female children, partly due to differences in child, maternal, and household characteristics, including rural-urban differences. A 10% increase in food prices resulted in a reduction in weight-forage and height-forage Z-scores by 0.1491 and 0.1466, respectively. In comparison, female children exhibited a 2% lower likelihood of being wasted and a 3.7% lower likelihood of being stunted than male children. These findings underscore the need to stabilize food prices through enhanced supply chains and ensure year-round availability of diverse foods, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of price shocks and reducing gender disparities in child malnutrition."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u8425\u517b\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7537\u7ae5\u6bd4\u5973\u7ae5\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u826f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6539\u5584\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u8425\u517b\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u8425\u517b\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u8425\u517b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u4eba\u53e3\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u996e\u98df\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Fairlie\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "findings": "\u7537\u7ae5\u6bd4\u5973\u7ae5\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u826f\uff0c\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da810%\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f53\u91cd\u548c\u8eab\u9ad8Z\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e0b\u964d0.1491\u548c0.1466\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u8425\u517b\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u7a33\u5b9a\u98df\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6539\u5584\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

This paper uses a recently-constructed dataset on the fiscal history of African countries from 1900 to 2015 to analyze the impact of decolonization on fiscal capacity (defined as revenue from taxes that are relatively difficult to collect and that require more administrative infrastructure). The analysis adopts a staggered difference-in-difference approach, implemented using a stacked event study. It finds no discernible pre-trends prior to decolonization, and a substantial increase in fiscal capacity starting about 5-6 years after decolonization. This result \u2013 which implies substantial state-building activity in postcolonial Africa \u2013 is robust to tests for a variety of alternative explanations, the use of alternative control groups, and the use of generalized synthetic control methods. We also show that this effect is not explained by democratization or improved public goods provision. Our conceptual framework instead posits that post-colonial states were able to increase tax revenues from hard-to-collect sources because their higher degree of legitimacy improved citizens\u2019 tax morale.

In this new environment, the 2020 changes created a risk that the US would suffer a repeat of the 1970s, a risk compounded by the FOMC\u2019s slow reaction as inflation rose during 2021-2022.

Using observational data, randomized survey experiments, incentivized borrowing-to-invest decisions, and textual analyses, we show that the moral connotations inherent in debt-related language influence how individuals, firms, and policymakers perceive borrowing. In several languages, including German, Dutch, and Swedish, the standard term for \u201cdebt\u201d also connotes \u201cguilt.\u201d Leveraging this semantic overlap, we conduct survey experiments embedded in three household surveys across seven countries and one business survey. By randomizing debt-related wording, we find that guilt-connoted language significantly reduces individuals\u2019 willingness to borrow, their approval of public debt, and debt-financing plans among firm managers. This effect extends to an incentivized experiment, in which guilt-laden wording significantly reduces both the probability of borrowing and the amount borrowed. To complement the experimental results, we analyze three decades of German parliamentary speeches and find that politicians who oppose public debt systematically use guilt-connoted terms. A similar pattern emerges in financial advertising: guilt-laden language is concentrated in debt-relief campaigns, while neutral terminology dominates transactional promotions. Together, our findings demonstrate that moral connotations embedded in language shape economic behavior and are strategically employed in political and commercial discourse."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u503a\u52a1\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u9053\u5fb7\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u501f\u8d37\u610f\u613f\u3002", "research_question": "\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4f53\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5bf9\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u9690\u542b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u542b\u4e49\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u3001\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u67e5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u6027\u501f\u8d37\u51b3\u7b56\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u5e26\u6709\u201c\u5185\u759a\u201d\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u503a\u52a1\u8bed\u8a00\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u501f\u8d37\u610f\u613f\u548c\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u9053\u5fb7\u542b\u4e49\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5e7f\u544a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This body of literature is mainly focused on \ud835\udc5d-median and \ud835\udc5d-center problems. Relatively few papers in the literature on aggregation explicitly concern the Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP). Our work examines the beneficial use of aggregation in the context of the CFLP. We focus on problems where there are significantly more demand points than potential facility locations, since this is where aggregation is most applicable in reducing complexity. We examine ways to obtain an aggregation at a fixed resolution, that is likely to perform well for a given instance of the problem. These aggregation techniques will form the core of a broader algorithmic framework, which contributes to the literature concerning heuristics for CFLPs. Our core aggregation method is based on applying \ud835\udc58-means clustering in R \ud835\udc5a, where \ud835\udc5a is the number of potential facilities. The space in which we apply the clustering is constructed by applying a transformation to the normalized distance matrix corresponding to the original CFLP problem. The aim of applying the transformation is to magnify differences in distance where relevant, and to compress irrelevant differences in distance. We evaluate our heuristic method on larger instances based on a real-world problem in reverse logistics. The results are encouraging and indicate that our method is capable of outperforming an intuitive benchmark aggregation method. We find that choosing the right hyperparameters and starting with a good initialization help our method perform better."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\uff08CFLP\uff09\u4e2d\u9700\u6c42\u805a\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ek-means\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u9006\u5411\u7269\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u95ee\u9898\uff08CFLP\uff09\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\ud835\udc5d-median\u548c\ud835\udc5d-center\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800cCFLP\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u805a\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8ek-means\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ek-means\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u53d8\u6362\u653e\u5927\u76f8\u5173\u8ddd\u79bb\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "findings": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9006\u5411\u7269\u6d41\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3aCFLP\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The index we propose, the \u201dGlobal Gender Distortions Index (GGDI)\u201d, measures the losses in aggregate productivity that gender-based misallocation imposes. Our index allows us to separately identify labor demand distortions (e.g., discrimination in hiring for formal jobs) from labor supply distortions (e.g., frictions that discourage women\u2019s labor force participation) and can be computed using data on labor income and job types. Our methodology also highlights an important distinction between welfare-relevant misallocation and the consequences on aggregate GDP if misallocation arises between market work and non-market activities. To showcase the versatility of our index, we analyze gender misallocation within countries over time, across countries over the development spectrum, and across local labor markets within countries.

Our analysis, leveraging regional variation and a fiscal instrument immune to region-specific shocks, reveals a significant crowding-in effect, with 1 euro in ESI funds increasing private investment by 1.1 euros and business R&D by 0.1 euros after two years. The effect is stronger in developed regions for private investment and in less developed regions for R&D. Additionally, crowding-in effects are stronger in regions where corporate private debt is relatively higher.

Lungowe, concerning the liability of an English company for environmental damage caused by its subsidiary in Zambia. The decision confirms that English parent companies can owe a duty of care to foreign claimants affected by operations of their subsidiaries abroad and that the English courts may have jurisdiction to hear such cases even when a foreign court is a more appropriate place for the trial. It establishes an important precedent for providing access to justice for foreign claimants in transnational corporate liability litigation. Given the global presence of English companies, and the fact that their foreign subsidiaries have been involved in multiple cases of environmental damage in the host states, the decision could give an impetus to future claims brought in the English courts. Also, the decision opens some interesting possibilities for climate change liability litigation against English parent companies and their foreign subsidiaries, as their cumulative greenhouse gas emissions would likely be considerably higher than taken separately, arguably making prospective claims against them more viable."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u82f1\u56fd\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u96622019\u5e74\u5224\u51b3\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u6d77\u5916\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u9020\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u635f\u5bb3\u8d1f\u6709\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u4e14\u82f1\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u6848\u4ef6\u6709\u7ba1\u8f96\u6743\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5224\u4f8b\u4e3a\u8de8\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d23\u4efb\u8bc9\u8bbc\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u56fd\u7d22\u8d54\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53f8\u6cd5\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u9488\u5bf9\u82f1\u56fd\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u53ca\u5176\u6d77\u5916\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u8d23\u4efb\u8bc9\u8bbc\u3002", "research_question": "\u82f1\u56fd\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u6d77\u5916\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u9020\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u635f\u5bb3\u8d1f\u6709\u8d23\u4efb\uff1f\u82f1\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u662f\u5426\u6709\u6743\u5ba1\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u6848\u4ef6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u82f1\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6d77\u5916\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u591a\u6b21\u6d89\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u635f\u5bb3\u6848\u4ef6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d23\u4efb\u53ca\u53f8\u6cd5\u7ba1\u8f96\u6743\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8de8\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d23\u4efb\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u5bf9\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u53f8\u6cd5\u7ba1\u8f96\u6743\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u82f1\u56fd\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u5224\u51b3\u53ca\u5176\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u5224\u51b3\u786e\u8ba4\u82f1\u56fd\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u6d77\u5916\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u635f\u5bb3\u8d1f\u6709\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u6709\u6743\u5ba1\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u6848\u4ef6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8de8\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d23\u4efb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5916\u56fd\u7d22\u8d54\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u53f8\u6cd5\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u82f1\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53ca\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u8bc9\u8bbc\u3002"}}

This approach preserves the philosophy of \"One framework, countless scenarios,\" simultaneously ensuring accessibility for non-technical users and technical reliability. The limitations of existing solutions, such as LangChain and MetaGPT, are analyzedthese either require code writing or are constrained by an internal LLM-centric architecture.

Extracting semantic information for such market analyses offers promising utilities, though most methods rely on information from a single type of document, which limits their ability to establish accurate estimates. Effective predictions benefit from comprehensive, multisource information, but face the challenges of modeling and synthesizing information dispersed across separate, long documents. This study targets a fundamental question: How can we enhance financial market risk predictions for improved investment decisions by integrating information available in distinct types of financial documents? On the basis of the theory-inspired computational design research paradigm, we propose a concept-guided cross-document modeling method that extracts essential information from multisource, interrelated documents to estimate volatility. This method is novel in the design of a concept-guided transformer that leverages established financial \u201cconcepts\u201d to extract essential information from individual long financial documents, and in modeling two types of concept-specific cross-document information: one is unique to separate documents, and another is reinforced across multiple documents. With a large-scale cross-document dataset, we evaluate the proposed method relative to nine prevalent methods that pertain to machine learning, deep neural networks, or advanced long- or cross-document modeling. The proposed method significantly outperforms all the benchmarks in mean squared error, mean absolute error, and out-of-sample R^2.&nbsp; Using real-world market data, we show that a long-short investment strategy based on volatilities predicted by our proposed method yields returns more than twice as high as those based on predictions using only a single type of document. The study makes methodological contributions to the extant information systems literature on cross-document modeling and investment decision support."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6295\u8d44\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u7c7b\u578b\u6587\u6863\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u9762\u4e34\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u6e90\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6837\u672c\u5916R^2\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e5d\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u56de\u62a5\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u6587\u6863\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Methodology/results: We focus on three measures of waiting time in asynchronous telemedicine: initial waiting time (the duration from a patient's initial request to admission into an online consultation session), average in-process waiting time (the average time between a patient's question and the doctor's response during the session), and the variability of in-process waiting times, which together capture both the initial and ongoing responsiveness to patients during asynchronous care delivery. We use 42,111 patients' online and offline consultation records from a primarily text-based, asynchronous telemedicine platform affiliated with a top-ranked hospital system (February 2021-April 2024). Our results show that patients with a longer (above median) average in-process waiting time (\u22650.75 hours) have 14.53%, 16.47%, and 13.41% lower odds for subsequent all visits, online visits, and outpatient visits in the next 30 days, respectively. Patients with a higher (above median) variability of in-process waiting times (\u22650.40 hours) have 9.70% and 12.72% lower odds of subsequent all visits and offline outpatient visits in the next 30 days, respectively. Surprisingly, initial waiting time shows no significant effect. Results remain consistent when considering whether the subsequent visits are with the same doctor. Finally, consultation fee negatively moderates the relationship between in-process waiting time and subsequent visits. Managerial implications: Average in-process waiting time in asynchronous telemedicine has the most significant impact on both subsequent online and offline visits among the three waiting time metrics. The findings highlight reducing in-process waiting in asynchronous telemedicine as a viable means of enhancing patient engagement and ensuring continuity of care across channels."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f02\u6b65\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0b\u5c31\u8bca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u54a8\u8be2\u8d39\u7528\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u8f83\u957f\u6216\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u540e\u7eed\u5c31\u8bca\u51e0\u7387\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u521d\u59cb\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u54a8\u8be2\u8d39\u7528\u5bf9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u5c31\u8bca\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u8d1f\u5411\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u5f02\u6b65\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0b\u5c31\u8bca\uff1f\u54a8\u8be2\u8d39\u7528\u662f\u5426\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u4f7f\u5f97\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u5f02\u6b65\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u540e\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752842,111\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0b\u54a8\u8be2\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u521d\u59cb\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u5c31\u8bca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u8f83\u957f\u6216\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u540e\u7eed\u5c31\u8bca\u51e0\u7387\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0814.53%-16.47%\uff09\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u54a8\u8be2\u8d39\u7528\u8d1f\u5411\u8c03\u8282\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u5c31\u8bca\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u60a3\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u8de8\u6e20\u9053\u62a4\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002"}}

Driven by cultural influence, limited-edition releases, and the proliferation of digital marketplaces, sneaker reselling has evolved into a multi-billion-dollar industry globally that attracts avid collectors, and individual investors. This paper leverages a unique blend of proprietary resale data and external insights from StockX to comprehensively examine profitability determinants within this vibrant ecosystem. Focusing on high-demand models from Adidas, Jordan, and Nike, this analysis evaluates key metrics such as net profit margins, time-to-sell, and sales channel efficiency across popular sneakers including the Yeezy 350V2, Yeezy Slides, Yeezy Foam Runner, Air Jordan 1, Air Jordan 4, Air Jordan 11, and Nike Dunk. The findings highlight that short holding periods and direct-to-consumer channels consistently yield higher returns, while extended holding periods and intermediary platforms may impact profitability due to market volatility and transaction fees. Additionally, product attributes such as exclusive colorways, mid-range sizing, and limited releases may influence resale value.

These responses differ in terms of brevity, specificity, and tone when addressing or acknowledging content in reviews. While prior research has explored the effects of response presence, response timing, length, and sentiment, little is known about how contextually relevant and persuasively crafted responses shape product reputation. We draw on signaling theory and communication accommodation theory to model a mechanism through which managers who closely align their responses with customer reviews send credible signals of engagement and product quality and further amplify the effectiveness of those signals through narrative and persuasive communication. Using a panel dataset of hotel reviews and responses from Tripadvisor, we quantify the contextual alignment between manager responses and review content by introducing the STARS (Semantic Textual Affinity Reactions Score) algorithm based on Sentence-BERT and derive the narrative strength and persuasive features, including solution, clarification, and credibility, using the GPT-4 large language model. Our study finds that semantic alignment in responses significantly improves product reputation and uncovers interdependent relationships among semantic alignment, review convergence, product reputation, and industry response practices. We further show that the significant effect of semantic alignment on product reputation is amplified when responses are crafted with high narrative and persuasive quality. Our findings suggest that effective managerial responses are beyond basic engagement but need to be both strategically constructed and tailored to customer concerns that jointly shape firm reputation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u5ba2\u6237\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u56de\u5e94\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ea7\u54c1\u58f0\u8a89\uff0c\u4e14\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u679c\u3002", "research_question": "\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4ea7\u54c1\u58f0\u8a89\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5ba2\u6237\u8bc4\u8bba\u56de\u5e94\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u4f17\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5176\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u53f7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u9002\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTripadvisor\u7684\u9152\u5e97\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u56de\u5e94\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528STARS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eSentence-BERT\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528GPT-4\u63d0\u53d6\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "findings": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ea7\u54c1\u58f0\u8a89\uff0c\u4e14\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5728\u56de\u5e94\u4e2d\u6ce8\u91cd\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u58f0\u8a89\u3002"}}

Accordingly, organizational efforts that increase help acceptance among low-resourced individuals are crucial for addressing inequities and improving social welfare. This research introduces a goal-based theory of help acceptance, which suggests that positioning the help as facilitating the audience's pursuit of their existing goals can increase their willingness to accept help. Using full-cycle field research that includes a qualitative pilot, archival data, prediction surveys, and a field experiment (N = 5,685), we identify the potential goals that low-resourced recipients can pursue with financial help, document the prevalence of different goal-based promotional appeals in organizational practices, and then examine the effects of these appeals on help acceptance among low-resourced individuals. This work examines help acceptance in the context of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest food assistance program in the United States. We find that organizations promote SNAP by emphasizing how it can fulfill basic needs associated with survival (e.g., address hunger), and that this is believed to be the most effective way to engage eligible beneficiaries. In contrast, we find that potential recipients are most motivated when the assistance is framed as advancing interdependent goals (e.g., to strengthen community ties), which reflect the socialized priorities in working-class cultures. By integrating class-based cultural norms with identitybased theories of goal pursuit, this work identifies and addresses a novel barrier to help acceptance among low-resourced individuals."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c06\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5316\u793e\u533a\u8054\u7cfb\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u66f4\u613f\u610f\u63a5\u53d7\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6ee1\u8db3\u57fa\u672c\u751f\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u613f\u63a5\u53d7\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e2e\u52a9\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9636\u7ea7\u6587\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u76ee\u6807\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5468\u671f\u5b9e\u5730\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u6027\u8bd5\u70b9\u3001\u6863\u6848\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=5,685\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u901a\u5e38\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e2e\u52a9\u6ee1\u8db3\u57fa\u672c\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u89e3\u51b3\u9965\u997f\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u7fa4\u4f53\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u63a5\u53d7\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5316\u793e\u533a\u8054\u7cfb\uff09\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6574\u5408\u9636\u7ea7\u6587\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u76ee\u6807\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e2e\u52a9\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u65b0\u969c\u788d\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u63a8\u5e7f\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Defining serial acquisitions based on a granular S&amp;P industry taxonomy, we find that they account for 24-37% of majority-control tech M&amp;A, with over half completed by public firms. Follow-on targets in a series are generally larger and older than the initial acquisition, and among public acquirers, starting a series is associated with higher market value and greater innovation value, but not with significant changes in market competitiveness. Among deals with valid transaction values, over half of serial deals exceed the minimum reporting threshold of the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act. However, in below-threshold acquisitions, acquirers primarily target their core business category. Accounting for the cumulative value of a series would, in most cases, keep the timing of HSR review unchanged or modestly accelerate it, but when it does accelerate it, review could occur several deals or years earlier, potentially yielding important benefits in markets with long acquisition sequences. Finally, Google, Amazon, Facebook/Meta, Apple and Microsoft (GAFAM) stand out for more frequent serial acquisitions, many of which are entirely below the HSR threshold or have missing transaction values, expand beyond their core categories, and target younger, venture capitalbacked firms. Yet, some other large technology and private equity acquirers engage in a comparable number of acquisition series or have a comparable number of deals within a series, which suggests that limiting enhanced scrutiny to GAFAM alone is unwarranted."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e862010\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u79d1\u6280\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u5360\u591a\u6570\u63a7\u80a1\u79d1\u6280\u5e76\u8d2d\u768424-37%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u534a\u7531\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u540e\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u76ee\u6807\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u521d\u59cb\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u5927\u4e14\u66f4\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u542f\u52a8\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u4ef7\u503c\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u4ea4\u6613\u4ef7\u503c\u8d85\u8fc7\u7f8e\u56fdHSR\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u62a5\u544a\u95e8\u69db\u3002GAFAM\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u5927\u578b\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u516c\u53f8\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u5bf9GAFAM\u52a0\u5f3a\u5ba1\u67e5\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u3002", "research_question": "\u79d1\u6280\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u5728\u79d1\u6280\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e76\u8d2d\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75282010\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u79d1\u6280\u884c\u4e1a\u5e76\u8d2d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eS&amp;P\u884c\u4e1a\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4ea4\u6613\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u5360\u591a\u6570\u63a7\u80a1\u79d1\u6280\u5e76\u8d2d\u768424-37%\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u5927\u4e14\u66f4\u6210\u719f\uff1b\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u542f\u52a8\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u4ef7\u503c\u76f8\u5173\uff1bGAFAM\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u8d2d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5ba1\u67e5\u8303\u56f4\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8eGAFAM\u516c\u53f8\u3002"}}

While most prior work relies on optimization-based solution methods, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework to determine the attacker's interdiction decisions. Our approach can generate interdiction solutions for both deterministic or stochastic single interdiction attempt environments with the same trained agent. We can also adjust the training environment to produce agents capable of making interdiction decisions when multiple interdiction attempts per an arc are allowed. Through computational experiments, we train RL agents using three off-the-shelf algorithms and evaluate their performance on diverse network instances.

The model developed here offers destination marketing organisations clear, actionable guidance on how to distribute their marketing budget to achieve portfolio configurations that are efficient in terms of risk and return, while remaining feasible given budget constraints and known elasticity patterns.

Nascent research has uncovered complex reactions to advertising when recipients are aware of GAI use. However, without regulatory standards for GAI disclosure in advertising, recipients are never certain about GAI use, and often believe it is being used even when it isn't. We call this AI belief. Using real ads, our research demonstrates that the effects of GAI use in advertising can be reproduced even when GAI is not being used. This has important implications.

The latter measures the worst-case ratio, attained by the weighted objective relative to its maximum value, with respect to all possible weights. The main results include a simple boundary representation of the performance index as the minimum of criterion-specific performance ratios, and a computationally simple method of determining a relatively robust decision up to any prespecified performance tolerance by maximizing an \u03b5-augmented performance index. The proposed method relies merely on the continuity of all criterion functions and the compactness of the set of feasible decisions which may be nonconvex. This imposes no restrictions at all for any finite action set. A notable feature of our method is that it endogenously yields the tradeoffs between all criteria, including a performance guarantee relative to decisions justified by any other weighting. A number of structural results, examples, and applications are provided, as well as generalizations to allow for limited weight ambiguity, criterion ambiguity, and generalized aggregation of criteria based on an axiomatic foundation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u65e2\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u03b5\u589e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u51c6\u5219\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u51f8\u53ef\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002"}}

These differ in capital intensity and project duration: fossil fuel investments require lower upfront investment and have shorter duration, whereas renewables are more capital-intensive with longer-lived assets. We show that a negative economic shock (such as an energy supply shock or recession) leads to both cuts in total investment and to a shift in the composition of the remaining investment toward fossil fuel projects. This delays the clean energy transition, even if renewable energy is cost-effective on a levelised cost basis, implying a role for policies to sustain clean investment during recessions. We discuss how this mechanism can be amplified by higher interest rates, pro-cyclical climate policies, perceived risk, and financial frictions, and we relate our findings to recent empirical episodes (e.g. the 2022-23 energy crisis and post-2008 recession)."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u90e8\u95e8\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u6295\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d1f\u9762\u51b2\u51fb\u4f1a\u5ef6\u7f13\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u8d1f\u9762\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6e90\u6295\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8870\u9000\u671f\u95f4\u80fd\u6e90\u6295\u8d44\u504f\u5411\u5316\u77f3\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u963b\u788d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e24\u90e8\u95e8\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5316\u77f3\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u6295\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u8d1f\u9762\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b2\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u6295\u8d44\u51cf\u5c11\u5e76\u504f\u5411\u5316\u77f3\u71c3\u6599\uff0c\u5ef6\u7f13\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b2\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u9700\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8870\u9000\u671f\u652f\u6301\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u6295\u8d44\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

Despite the ubiquity of store credit, little is known about who business owners lend to and why. In this paper, we document practices around store credit and study its impact on businesses and customers in the context of an informal Indian settlement. First, in a conjoint experiment, we find that store owners are more likely to offer credit to their in-group members, such as customers from their religion or caste. Second, in a field experiment, we find that offering store credit expands businesses' market access by increasing foot traffic and sales at their stores. Third, we find that subsidizing businesses' ability to lend to random customers allows them to experiment, learn borrower type, and to increase future lending to both in-group and out-group members, even after the subsidy concludes. Finally, in a survey with customers, we find suggestive evidence that credit helps with consumption smoothing. Together, our results help explain the ubiquity of store credit by highlighting its benefits to both businesses and customers, and underscore the promise of subsidies in increasing learning and lending across social groups in informal credit markets."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u5c45\u70b9\u4e2d\u5546\u5e97\u4fe1\u8d37\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5546\u5bb6\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u8d37\u66f4\u591a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed9\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6269\u5927\u5e02\u573a\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u7fa4\u4f53\u501f\u8d37\uff0c\u5e76\u5e2e\u52a9\u987e\u5ba2\u5e73\u6ed1\u6d88\u8d39\u3002", "research_question": "\u5546\u5e97\u4fe1\u8d37\u7684\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5546\u5bb6\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5546\u5e97\u4fe1\u8d37\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u539f\u56e0\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u504f\u597d\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8054\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "findings": "\u5546\u5bb6\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u5411\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u6210\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u8d37\uff1b\u4fe1\u8d37\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u5ba2\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u9500\u552e\u989d\uff1b\u8865\u8d34\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u7fa4\u4f53\u501f\u8d37\uff1b\u4fe1\u8d37\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6d88\u8d39\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5546\u5e97\u4fe1\u8d37\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u8d34\u4fc3\u8fdb\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u4fe1\u8d37\u5e02\u573a\u8de8\u7fa4\u4f53\u501f\u8d37\u7684\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data x and Bob holds m inputs y1,...,ym. They want to compute m instances of a bipartite relation R(\u00b7,\u00b7) on every pair (x,y1),...,(x,ym). We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with m, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on m. Thus, for such problems, data behaves like a consumable resource that is effectively destroyed upon use when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states, but not when transmitted classically. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u91cfm\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u7684\u590d\u5236\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968fm\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968fm\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ec5\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u6d88\u8017\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6d88\u8017\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9500\u552e\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We also show that as the number of growth options increases, future growth options can reduce the initial investment scale and accelerate the initial investment timing. The effect of scale reduction at the initial investment stage is more pronounced for levered firms relative to unlevered firms.

Agents---including consumers, firms, and a government---learn behavioral strategies through repeated interactions, enabling endogenous decisions on pricing, labor supply, and green investment. The model incorporates noisy preferences, carbon taxes, and targeted subsidies, allowing us to simulate complex interactions under alternative policy regimes. We find that information frictions can stimulate experimentation and accelerate green technology adoption, while common shocks enhance coordination but may reduce innovation. Policy design plays a critical role: flexible carbon pricing and targeted subsidies for green leaders and low-wage workers consistently outperform flat-rate or proportional schemes in achieving both environmental and equity objectives. Our results highlight the advantages of MARL for modeling adaptive behavior in dynamic, high-dimensional economic systems where analytical solutions are intractable. The framework offers practical insights into the design of responsive and inclusive sustainability policies in settings where agents continuously learn and adapt to evolving environments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3001\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u4e92\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u5185\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u3001\u78b3\u7a0e\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8865\u8d34\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u7b56\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u7eff\u8272\u6280\u672f\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5171\u540c\u51b2\u51fb\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u521b\u65b0\u3002\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1a\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u78b3\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u5bf9\u7eff\u8272\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u53ca\u4f4e\u85aa\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8865\u8d34\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u73af\u5883\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u6216\u6bd4\u4f8b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3001\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7eff\u8272\u6280\u672f\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u73af\u5883\u653f\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5f02\u8d28\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u7b56\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "findings": "\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7eff\u8272\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5171\u540c\u51b2\u51fb\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u4f46\u6291\u5236\u521b\u65b0\uff1b\u7075\u6d3b\u78b3\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8865\u8d34\u4f18\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86MARL\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}
