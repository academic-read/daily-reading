To this end, this paper presents amultiform optimization algorithm with coupled subspace alignment and two-stage adaptive differential evolution (MFO-CSA-TADE), enabling efficient solution of complex scheduling problems through constructing a novel multiform optimization framework and knowledge transfer mechanism. First, the strong coupling relationshipsof energy system is decoupled to decompose the original problem into two weakly constrained surrogate tasks: an interval-valued electro-thermal uncertainty task and a deterministic electro-cooling task, forming the proposed multiform optimization framework. Second, a knowledge transfer strategy based on coupled subspace alignmentis developed. Through alignment mapping and cooperative evolution of cross-task coupled electrical variables, efficient knowledge transfer between surrogate tasks is achieved, overcoming the information interaction barriers in traditional multiform optimization. The two-stage adaptive differential evolution strategy (TADE) employs aneighborhood dual mutation mechanism to achieve the task optimization. The first stage uses a diversity-driven TADE to concurrently evolve two surrogate tasks, maximizing the exploration of feasible region intersections to enhance solution diversity and robustness. The second stage utilizes a convergence-driven TADE to focus onthe original task’s feasible space, generating high-quality Pareto sets. Case studies in a Shanxi mine demonstrate that compared with six benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm maintains superior Pareto front quality and uncertainty handling while reducing computation time to 1/6-1/3, significantly improving solution efficiency in complex scheduling scenarios."}}

Using a sample of public manufacturers, I use transaction-level data to construct a firm-level measure of couponing activity and find that earnings are less persistent when generated with heavy reliance on couponing. Further, greater couponing in the current quarter increases analyst optimism for future periods, leading to an increased likelihood that the firm misses analyst expectations in the subsequent period (which results in predictably negative earnings announcement returns). Collectively, my findings highlight how market participants’ forecasting and trading decisions can benefit from information regarding price discounting."}}

This paper examines how Talmudic sages developed sophisticated rhetorical mechanisms to bridge the gap between rule-following and moral excellence, offering valuable insights for modern organizational ethics. The study focuses on a Talmudic devices: the \"ke-ilu\" (it is as if) formulation and similar terms, which establish powerful analogies between ordinary actions and deep spiritual truths; equivalence statements, which link individual precepts to a multitude of commandments; and hyperbolic comparisons, which serve to underscore moral gravity. These techniques transformed ordinary behavior into acts of cosmic significance, making ethical achievement accessible while eliminating morally neutral actions. The paper argues that modern leaders can apply these ancient insights by using compelling analogies, emotional resonance, and values-driven storytelling to inspire ethical excellence rather than merely enforcing minimum standards. This approach offers a timeless model for creating organizational cultures that celebrate genuine moral purpose over technical compliance."}}

However, achieving reliable forecasting remains challenging due to complex and dynamically evolving spatiotemporal patterns. Existing forecasting methods often fail to adapt effectively to these dynamic traffic conditions and typically incur high computational costs, significantly limiting their deployment in real-time traffic management scenarios. To address these engineering challenges, this study proposes a novel Attention-based Spatial-Temporal Network (ASTNet), explicitly designed for adaptive and efficient real-time traffic forecasting. ASTNet introduces two innovative AI-driven modules: an Adaptive Spatial Graph Encoder (ASGE), which dynamically models evolving spatial dependencies from real-time traffic data, thus overcoming the limitations of static graph structures; and a Temporal Attention-Gated Unit (TAGU), which efficiently captures critical temporal dependencies through the integration of recurrent gating mechanisms and self-attention techniques. Extensive evaluations conducted on widely-used traffic benchmark datasets (PEMS04, METR-LA, etc.) confirm that ASTNet achieves superior predictive accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing inference latency. Ablation studies further validate that the combined innovations of ASGE and TAGU are crucial for ASTNet’s outstanding performance, highlighting its practical suitability and strong potential for deployment in real-time intelligent transportation applications."}}

From DSO’s perspective, state-of-the-art DNEP-related models opt for systemfriendly DER investments, that satisfy the required technical standards regarding reliability and security of supply, but do not guarantee the financial sustainability of profit-based DER investments made by private companies called Energy Service Providers (ESPs). On the other hand, ESPs opt for profit-maximizing DER planning decisions, which may lead to unnecessarily higher DNEP-related costs for the DSO or may also lead to unpredictably higher RES spillage in the long term. In this paper, we propose a novel ESP-DSO coordination scheme, which strikes an optimal balance between regulated DNEP-related investments (made by the DSO) and profit-based DER investments (made by the ESP). Performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing business-as-usual solutions achieving a “win-win” solution for both stakeholders. We also introduce two novel metrics, namely “new distribution network Lines to DER/Total investment Ratio LtDR/LtTR”, which can be used by the regulator or policy makers towards validating or promoting sophisticated Flexible Connection Agreements (FCAs) respectively. Finally, our sensitivity analysis results facilitate easily configurable FCAs(according to several ESP’s conditional value at risk parameters and various mixes of DER investment portfolios), which in turn are expected to unlock the economic potential of long-term public-private partnership investment funds towards achieving the goals of the clean energy transition."}}

This approach provides precise support for task path planning in complex geographical environments, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in such scenarios.

However, some of the images with privacy leakage can only be obtained by analyzing multiple content-related images, and are hardly detected in a one-image scenario. Although global semantic features like context and topic may contain information to reveal these images, it is difficult to obtain this information by relying only on the features of image modality. To solve this problem, an image privacy detection method combining multi-image correlation and multimodal features is proposed in this paper. This method leverages a set of semantically related images along with their corresponding text summary to establish semantic correlations, and utilizes the advantages of additive and dot product attention mechanisms to construct effective multimodal fusion between the text summary and each individual image feature. This enables each image to perform privacy-leakage detection not only based on its own features, but also the contextual information from semantically related images. At the same time, in order to further strengthen the correlation between modality and privacy leakage, this paper also incorporates the saliency feature of both modalities into the privacy-leaking image prediction process, providing analysis concerns from different perspectives. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively capture inter-image semantic correlations through multi-image text summarization, which is helpful in improving the overall performance of privacy-leaking image detection."}}

In contrast to studies that rely on discretionary corporate social responsibility data, we develop an exogenous measure of firms’ renewable energy exposure driven by government policy mandates, thereby addressing potential selection bias. Using panel data from 2001 to 2021, we find that increased exposure to renewable energy is associated with lower productivity and profitability, but higher volatility in financial performance. Such impacts are particularly pronounced for firms in sectors with high energy demands, where the cost and consistency of energy supply are crucial for maintaining competitive advantages. Our findings indicate that while government renewable energy policy mandates support sustainability goals, they also present implicit costs and near-term financial instability for firms. Policymakers need to adopt a balanced approach to ensure environmental goals do not undermine firms’ financial soundness."}}

The improved grasshopper optimization algorithm (IGOA) is developed to avoid this characteristic for obtaining the optimal and better global solution of the reactive power flow optimization problem (ORPD). Therefore, the ORPD problem is represented by the total active power loss. The grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) basically mimics the real grasshoppers in terms of local movement to obtain food and wide movement for migration. The grasshopper movement relationship was given by an easy mathematical equation influenced by surrounding forces and social interaction represented by  the distance between the different grasshoppers in the swarm. However, a linear control parameter was added in the previous grasshopper movement equation that gradually decreases in order to converge to the optimal solution. In order to improve this method, a random parameter was integrated into the previous control parameter, similar to what is found in the particle swarm method, to disperse the search in the feasible space for getting a better solution and also speed up the convergence. This method and the improved method were implemented on model electric networks IEEE 30-bus and  IEEE 118-bus  in order to reduce losses, with various objectives. Furthermore, a source of renewable energy was added to the electric network to improve its  performance and further reduce objective functions."}}

It is called the Soil Pore Space Structural Classification System (SPSCS) and has a design partially similar to the Textural Classification System. The SPSCS has two categorical levels: Order (9) and Sub-Order (4). Therefore, 36 possible structural classes are foreseen, called Families, which group soils according to air availability curves Aa(suction s) close, where Aa(s) is the complement of the water retention curve (WRC) to the saturation water content. To specify the Order, the percentages of macro, meso, and microspaces are plotted on a ternary classification diagram, called structural triangle, in which its specific subareas will define the Orders. The Sub-Orders are defined from four variation ranges of the effective porosity values. In these procedures, the van Genuchten WRC equation and an optimization protocol of its parameters are required. Within each Family, its theoretical reference soils, called type-soils, are conceived. The distributions of the Aa(s) type-curves of the 36 Families thus allow a global assessment of the porous volumetric structure of the soils, which makes SPSCS a new tool for pedological investigation. SPSCS also allows an estimate of the air and water capacities and the saturated hydraulic conductivity. The application potential of SPSCS will be enhanced if other pedological tools are used, such as mineralogical, textural, pedogenetic studies, etc. In a future paper, the SPSCS will be applied to a wide database to validate its procedures and demonstrate its application potential."}}

Specifically, this type of disclosure is more common for firms that are cash-poorer, more indebted, riskier, are seen as more exposed to biodiversity issues, firms that have a higher score in environmental innovation, and that are already engaged in some reduction of their biodiversity impact. We also show that biodiversity incidents (rather than disclosure) are associated with an increase in the cost of issuing new debt.

Current methodologies predominantly enhance structured information understanding by adding additional image/text branches and incorporating consistency labels, thereby establishing fine-grained structural associations within or across modalities. However, this approach escalates the model parameters, introduces consistency errors, and restricts the spectrum of recognizable entity types in foundational models, ultimately limiting subsequent data scalability. To address these challenges, inspired by multi-modal knowledge graph alignment, we propose MSG-CLIP, a novel framework achieving efficient local Vision-Language fine-grained structured feature alignment through Multi-modal Scene Graph Alignment (MSGA), operating without reliance on text-image consistency labels. Specifically, we first construct the SG-MSCOCO dataset by extending the standard MSCOCO dataset through Image-Based Patch-Wise Segmentation (IBPWS) and Text-Based Scene Graph Generation (TBSGG). Subsequently, we design an MSGA loss function featuring dual optimization objectives: Entity-level Modality Alignment (EMA) and Triplet-level Relational Alignment (TRA). Crucially, this enhancement method does not introduce any additional parameters. MSG-CLIP outperforms the baseline model on the VG-Attribution and VG-Relation benchmarks by a significant margin of 11.2\\% and 2.5\\%, respectively. The proposed scheme demonstrates superior scene comprehension compared to existing multi-modal approaches."}}

A qualitative research design was employed to collect data through semi-structured interviews using a purposive sampling technique. Following a thematic analysis of the findings, the study revealed the existing challenges and opportunities of AI adoption among pre-service teachers and the timely need to integrate AI across teacher education curricula along with the necessity for more funding for AI and advanced policies on AI use in education. Moreover, the findings reiterated optimism among pre-service teachers towards AI and its potential in teacher education and K-12 classrooms for personalizing learning and fostering instructional practices. However, Pre-service teachers voiced concerns over ethical issues and student-teacher relationships because of AI integration in education. Recommendations for embedding AI literacy and sustained technology-related professional development in teacher education programs were offered. The study adds to the existing literature on AI in teacher education in the UAE context with new insights that contribute to future reforms in teacher education and the preparation of educators who are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the evolving AI-infused K-12 classrooms."}}

Our results hold when considering the ex-post and ex-ante situations of firms adopting captive insurance structures. Firms with higher levels of holdings by insiders and institutional blockholders are more likely to use captive insurance, as are firms with higher levels of total executive compensation and higher proportions of stock-based compensation. However, firms with higher proportions of options-based compensation are less likely to use captive insurance. Comparisons across financial and governance models indicate that the relationship between captive insurance usage and governance variables is stronger than the relationship between captive insurance usage and financial variables."}}

The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative L2-errors below 10−2. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher–subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI"}}

However, NBS-related policies can also increase vulnerabilities and exacerbate inequalities. This paper aims to improve knowledge of how NBS-related policies affect social justice and vulnerable groups in particular. Based on a detailed study of current NBS developments in the City of Vienna, a participatory research design involving vulnerable groups, and a mixed methods approach conducting the empirical analysis, the paper focuses on social (in)equality in relation to NBS and urban heat. It uses Nancy Fraser&apos;s justice approach to examine the spatial distribution of NBS, the recognition of the needs and preferences of heat affected individuals in relation to NBS, and the representation of vulnerable groups and their interests in NBS planning processes. The study highlights inequalities in access to NBS, as well as a lack of recognition and representation in decision-making processes. The findings emphasise the demand for inclusive planning processes that directly involve vulnerable groups, ensuring that their needs and perspectives are adequately recognized and represented. Ultimately, the paper argues that integrating justice into NBS planning can help mitigate social inequalities and foster more equitable adaptation to urban heat."}}

Mobile measurements were conducted to collect UHII data across different time periods in both winter and summer. A selection of representative urban morphological parameters—classified into two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characteristics—was analyzed using a combination of Kriging spatial interpolation, Spearman correlation analysis, and the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. The results indicate significant spatial and temporal differences in UHII between the old and new districts, with the old districts generally exhibiting more pronounced heat island effects. The influence of different morphological factors on UHII displays marked seasonal variation: during the daytime, 3D morphological parameters show stronger correlations with UHII in winter, while in summer, 2D parameters become more influential. At night, the impact of urban morphological characteristics is comparatively weaker. The RF model further quantifies the relative importance of each parameter, revealing that building density (BD)and road density (RD) are the most significant among the 2D parameters (with maximum importance values of 0.274 and 0.600), while mean building height(MBH) and street height-to-width ratio (H/W) are the dominant factors among the 3D parameters (with maximum importance values of 0.233 and 0.210). In the old districts, BD, RD, and vegetation coverage ratio(VCR) are the primary morphological drivers of local UHII, whereas in the new districts, street orientation(SO), BD, and MBH are the main influencing factors. The study recommends that urban planning should aim to optimize spatial building layouts and holistically integrate both 2D distributions and 3D structural features of urban morphology to mitigate UHI effects and promote livable and sustainable urban development."}}

I simulate the model using perfectly correlated demand and supply-side shocks to match the stylized facts.

However, collecting topographic beach data is possible for only a few days per month. By reducing the seaward extent of the survey, the incurred costs and risks to the survey schedule could be greatly reduced. However, this would result in information loss at the lowest extremes of the subaerial beach. This study assesses the feasibility of predicting this part of the beach using neural networks based on partial beach profile data. A range of network architectures were tested alongside linear extrapolation, which was used as a baseline model. Each model was tested on three beaches with varying morphology, ranging from steep (reflective) to mildly sloping (dissipative). The presence of morphological features was found to play a dominant role in the accuracy of the predicted profiles; profiles with more pronounced cross-shore morphological features, such as sandbars, produced the highest error. While local connectivity of each network architecture was found to be the key factor in producing realistic profiles, the 1D Convolutional Neural Network was found to be the most effective with an average RMSE of between 0.026-0.119m. This RMSE is not substantially larger than the vertical accuracy of current survey techniques (0.03 m), and the study found that errors of this magnitude have negligible effects when the survey data is used to calculate beach volumes and conduct numerical wave runup analysis to assess coastal flood risk."}}

The modulator incorporates the time-interleaved technique in the sampling switch and feedback DACs at half-clock frequency without decreasing its dynamic accuracy. To achieve a low offset voltage (VOS) of the isolated amplifier, a 7-bit current trimming circuit is added to the modulator’s input common-mode branch, which enables VOS adjustment within ±0.016 mV to ±0.5 mV. This input stage of the isolated amplifier is fabricated in 90-nm CMOS technology and operates at 5 V supply voltage. It achieves a measured 75.2-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) over a 100 kHz signal bandwidth and reduces offset voltage within ±8 μV after trimming."}}

However, existing methods suffer from several drawbacks, primarily manifested in long training times, with two main reasons: Firstly, there are numerous empty regions between the camera and the object surface, where the in-formation contribution to the final reconstruction quality is low. Secondly, each ray sample requires querying large multilayer perceptrons, leading to heavy computational burdens during training, affecting efficiency. Additionally, the lack of geometric constraints during 3D reconstruction results in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce a method called PM-NeuS. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) a progressive sampling strategy based on multi-resolution hash coding is designed to reasonably sample coordinate points in the space and reduce training time, and (2) the use of monocular prior knowledge to constrain surface geometry, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality surfaces, particularly excelling in fine-grained details and smooth areas, and achieves a training speed 22 times faster than NeuS."}}

The model dynamics involve endogenous innovation decisions and network building consistent with a preferential-attachment mechanism. Simulating the system’s evolution reveals that initial asymmetries are amplified over time, resulting in persistent but bounded gaps in performance and network position between firm types. AI-driven intangible assets especially exacerbate these gaps. There are also heterogeneous responses to dynamic events, such as network-wide shocks (e.g., technological and geopolitical shocks) or policy interventions (e.g., AI grants, diversification support), highlighting that the returns to firm capabilities are contingent on the firm’s capability states and the dynamic environments induced by such external events. Thus, this study contributes to understanding the micro-macro dynamics driving path dependence and persistent heterogeneity in evolving economic systems under technological change and network effects."}}

Herder cooperatives have emerged as a promising institutional innovation to address these sustainability challenges.OBJECTIVE：This study aims to assess whether herder cooperatives achieve higher multidimensional efficiency (integrating ecological, economic, and social performance) than large-scale and small-scale independent herders in Inner Mongolia. The analysis is conceptually grounded in the Resource-Based View (RBV), Institutional Theory, and Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) to explain cooperative advantages.METHODS：In 2022, we surveyed 223 herder households across four counties in Inner Mongolia. We developed an efficiency index with 18 indicators spanning ecological (pasture condition, stocking rate), economic (household income, livestock productivity), and social (social capital, livelihood stability) dimensions. Composite efficiency scores were calculated using an entropy-weighted method. We then employed Tobit regression to identify drivers of efficiency, particularly the effects of cooperative membership and resource endowments (e.g., grassland quality, labor, education, assets).RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS：Cooperative households significantly outperformed both large-scale and small-scale independent households in ecological and economic efficiency, while performing similarly in social efficiency. For example, cooperatives attained higher ecological efficiency (0.1134) than large-scale and small-scale households (0.1040 and 0.1037, respectively), and higher economic efficiency (0.0387 vs. 0.0355 and 0.0340). Social efficiency was comparable (~0.077 in all groups). Consequently, the composite efficiency of cooperative households (0.2288) exceeded those of large-scale (0.2169) and small-scale (0.2100) households. Tobit regression indicates that cooperative membership and favorable resource endowments significantly increase overall efficiency, whereas financial constraints and non-livestock training had limited or negative effects. These findings demonstrate a clear cooperative efficiency advantage. They are consistent with RBV, Institutional Theory, and SLF: cooperatives bundle resources, align member incentives for collective sustainability, and enhance multiple livelihood capitals to improve resilience.SIGNIFICANCE：Herder cooperatives are a valuable institutional innovation for sustainable pastoralism. Policy support for cooperative models and collective grazing management can improve grassland sustainability and foster rural development in pastoral regions."}}

To this end, this paper proposes a Feature-based CNN-to-ViT Structured Knowledge Distillation framework, dubbed FSKD, which combines the structured semantic knowledge embedded in CNN (teacher) features with the strength of ViT (student) in capturing long-range dependencies. Specifically, this framework includes a feature alignment module to bridge the representational gap between CNN and ViT features, and it incorporates a global feature alignment loss. Additionally, we develop corresponding distillation losses to capture the patch-level relationships and attention distribution differences across architectures, thereby enabling the effective transfer of structured semantic knowledge from CNNs to ViTs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method considerably enhances ViT performance in visual recognition tasks, particularly under scenarios with limited data."}}

TEC variations, along with IRI-2020 model data and geomagnetic storm parameters (Bx, By, Bz, Dst, AE, and ∑Kp indices), were statistically examined over six days, from May 9 to May 14, 2024. Additionally, the TEC variations were predicted using an ANN-based nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) model, which showed that the predicted TEC values more accurately matched the observed TEC data compared to the IRI-2020 model, as determined by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) method. No significant pre-storm activity was detected at any station. Almost all equatorial stations experienced TEC enhancements (up to +50 TECU) during the storm&apos;s main phase, indicating a positive effect. Outside the equatorial region, most stations showed a negative effect, with decreases up to -45 TECU. The impact of this geomagnetic storm was not uniformly distributed among all the observing stations. During the recovery phase, a few stations experienced rapid recovery. Overall, the analysis indicated a predominant negative effect of this geomagnetic storm. These anomalous TEC variations were explained through existing mechanisms and O/N2 ratio data, which showed a decrease during the main phase."}}

Additionally, to enhance the usability of SLB in MESS, a safe region concept is proposed, which considers the lifespan of SLB and is integrated into both the investment planning and pre-scheduling frameworks. Building upon this, a joint solution method combining distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and reinforcement learning (RL) is introduced, effectively bridging long-term investment planning with real-time scheduling. Comparative case studies suggest that SLB-based MESS can reduce the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) by approximately 11-24%, compared to the use of brand-new batteries. These results validate the effectiveness of our integrated investment planning and pre-scheduling approach."}}

However, precise forecasting of earthquake occurrence times remains a significant challenge, often affected by noise, model drift, and the absence of adaptive correction mechanisms in existing models. This study develops a novel prediction architecture to enhance the accuracy of earthquake occurrence time forecasting by addressing these limitations. We propose a hybrid method that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with a Kalman Filter. This approach estimates earthquake occurrence times from historical seismic timestamp data and incorporates a dynamic, adaptive error correction mechanism using real-time feedback from the Kalman Filter. The proposed hybrid LSTM-Kalman filter method outperformed the baseline standard LSTM and Attention-based LSTM models for timestamp prediction. It achieved lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values, alongside a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.9998, indicating a strong agreement between actual and predicted values. Visualizations further corroborate the hybrid model&apos;s precision in tracking actual times and its stable error distribution. Nevertheless, the model&apos;s performance in magnitude prediction remains limited. In conclusion, integrating a Kalman Filter into the LSTM architecture effectively mitigates variance and reduces forecasting drift in earthquake time prediction, offering a reliable tool for temporal forecasting. This capability has significant implications for advancing earthquake Early Warning Systems (EWS) in earthquake-prone areas by enabling more precise and timely alerts, ultimately contributing to improved disaster response and minimized casualties."}}

However, rural supply chains face significant challenges during their digital transformation, including weak supplier integration, poor information flow, and inadequate organizational capacity. This paper uses Bainiu Village in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, as a case study, employing a longitudinal research approach grounded in a power structure perspective to examine how digitalization reshapes rural supply chains and facilitates the collaborative evolution of both power and organizational structures. The findings reveal that: (1) The evolution of the rural supply chain’s organizational structure progresses through three stages: from a \"single-core fan-shaped supply chain\" to a \"single-core cluster supply chain,\" and ultimately to a \"multi-core cluster supply chain.\" The underlying power structure has also undergone a continuous evolutionary process, from \"platform unilateral monopoly, farmer dependence\" to \"platform monopoly strengthening, enterprise labor division deepening,\" followed by \"multi-platform competition\" and finally, \"enterprise autonomous decentralization.\" (2) In line with this, the supply chain adopts distinct organizational coordination strategies at each stage, including \"verbal agreements and kinship networks,\" \"formal contracts and professional labor division,\" and \"strategic alliances and cross-platform collaboration.\" (3) Moreover, the study develops an analytical framework based on the \"context-action-result\" model, illustrating how multi-dimensional collaboration strategies reconstruct power structures and drive the evolution of organizational forms in response to shifts in external conditions. This paper not only enriches theoretical research on the interplay between power structures and organizational evolution in the context of digitalization, but also provides practical insights into enhancing the resilience and competitiveness of rural supply chains."}}

As electricity grids become more dynamic due to the increasing penetration of renewable generation, data centers represent a promising but underutilized source of demand-side flexibility. This paper presents a quantitative framework to assess and activate the flexibility potential of data centers by deferring non-critical, high-latency IT workloads. Using real-world workload traces from the Alibaba Cluster Trace dataset, tasks are classified based on observed queuing latency, and a power model is developed to estimate energy consumption associated with different latency groups. A Latency-Aware Deferral for Flexibility (LAD-Flex) strategy is proposed to temporarily reduce data center power consumption in response to aggregator requests, while maintaining quality of service. The strategy accounts for estimated task duration, latency thresholds, and flexibility window constraints. Results from a one-week case study show that up to 22% of load can be deferred during flexibility windows, and that more than 20% of total data center power is attributable to tasks with deferrable latency. Additionally, an optimization framework is introduced to identify the notification period that maximizes the value of flexibility under a time-sensitive pricing scheme. The findings demonstrate that data centers, coupled with an aggregator, can reliably participate in short-notice demand response by leveraging workload-aware deferral strategies, offering both operational and economic benefits."}}

Stingy leadership is characterized by leaders who, despite resource availability, provide the absolute minimum resources allowed by law, for their employees. In developing stingy leadership, we drew on moral psychology to show that stingy leadership is distinct from abusive supervision and exploitative leadership because its harm is indirect and it does not stem from anger or callousness, but a misguided moral virtue. Nevertheless, stingy leadership creates compromises workplace outcomes (e.g., productivity, organizational citizenship behaviors, commitment). Because these harmful behaviors do not directly target employees, stingy leadership is harder to recognize as a form of destructive leadership. We end with practical implications for reducing stingy behavior work."}}

The framework we propose incorporates the antecedents and outcomes of leadership contagion, variables that explain the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, and the boundary effects that explain the conditions under which the leadership contagion mechanism may change. Through our review, we identify significant research gaps associated with the selection of different theories by researchers studying leadership contagion at multiple levels of analysis. We also highlight the need for a thorough investigation into the underlying mechanism of leadership contagion, theoretical and multilevel analysis, and the adoption of various methodological approaches to address these research gaps. Accordingly, we provide a detailed research agenda for future scholars, including the need to propose an integrative framework that specifies the unique cognitive, affective, and behavioral contagion mechanisms through which contagion effects is expected to be transmitted from leaders to followers, the need to understand better the “tipping point” of leader contagion versus leader counter-contagion, and the need for methodological approaches that will help address these substantive knowledge gaps in leadership contagion. In conclusion, we present our leadership contagion model, which we hope will provide a stimulus for further research on contagion-related studies in organizational contexts."}}

Consequently, existing chatter suppression method such as spindle speed variation, damped anti-vibration tool holders, and tuned mass dampers, are failed in RPF.After revealing chatter generation mechanism of robotic plastic forming, this study proposes a multi-DoF chatter suppression method through adding three spatial hydraulic actuators and actively control the damping of them.  In this way, real-time chatter stability is assessed to identify chatter-susceptible direction, trigger coordinated control of three hydraulic actuators to enhance damping in the critical direction.First, a dynamic model of RPF processes was developed, accounting for the complex geometric contact between blank and tool and the multi-DoF coupled damping of the forming system. Subsequently, chatter mechanism in the RPF was revealed through vibration analysis, showing that chatter is originated from negative damping effects. Based on the negative damping state of the RPF, a novel chatter stability index was developed to predict multi-DoF chatter, enabling prediction of chatter frequency, direction, and conditions. Furthermore, an active damping compensation-based chatter suppression method using coordinated control of three hydraulic actuators was proposed. Finally, experiments were conducted, in which the accuracy of the chatter prediction model was validated and the effectiveness of the chatter suppression method was demonstrated, with 93% amplitude attenuation at the chatter frequency."}}

Therefore, optimizing energy consumption in the condenser water loop is a key to reducing operating cost and carbon emission. In this study, a physics-based simulator was developed for the system using historical operational data, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 2.11% when validating the total energy consumption of six-month operational data. Utilizing the simulator, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization was performed to minimize the total energy consumption. Results demonstrated that utilizing variable speed equipment can further reduce the total energy consumption by 3.2%, compared to optimal operations relying solely on full-load conditions. Specifically, energy savings for pumps and fans were 15.7% and 29.6%, respectively, when variable speed equipment was employed. Additionally, an energy-saving potential by optimally distributing the water flow rates across cooling towers with multi-speed fans was investigated. The optimal distribution enhanced the overall performance of cooling towers under a specific operating condition, decreasing condenser water temperature, thereby leading to a decrease in chiller power consumption. Lastly, a rule-based semi-optimal control logic that makes the implementation straightforward was proposed, derived from insights into optimal operation characteristics. The proposed logic was able to reproduce optimal operations without compromising the amount of saving energy (< 0.1%) in comparison with the GA-identified optimal operations."}}
