Through a novel integration of Resource-Based View and Behavioral Theory of the Firm, we demonstrate that alliance relationships can substitute for internal capabilities and enable market entry when firms face performance constraints. Using a longitudinal dataset from the airline industry, we find that low-performing firms are more likely to enter new markets when a high proportion of allied partners are present, while a strong presence of competing alliances reduces the likelihood of entry. Furthermore, low-performing firms benefit more when their allies outnumber competitors in the target market. Our findings contribute to the RBV by demonstrating that alliances can become a substitute for internal capabilities and expand BTOF by accounting for power dynamics as a critical factor in market entry. These insights provide important theoretical and managerial implications for firms seeking to overcome resource constraints and successfully navigate new market entry."}}

However, large variations in action duration and visual conditions present significant challenges to existing methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Class-Guided Boundary Regression framework that integrates semantic features from the classification branch into the regression module, enabling more precise localization of action start and end points. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 (68.5% mAP) and ActivityNet1.3 (36.7% mAP)."}}

Results reveal that ecosystem quality (ECO) is both the strongest predictor and a necessary condition, with intention rising only above a 3.27 threshold. Resource readiness (CONDITION) mediates over half of ECO’s effect. Configurational analyses identify two pathways: one ecosystem-dependent, the other agency-driven. High predictive accuracy (PLS Q² = 0.30; AUC = 0.87) confirms model robustness. Findings extend TPB with threshold logic and inform context-sensitive strategies for fostering academic entrepreneurship in constrained environments."}}

This paper proposes a novel matching theory-based framework for energy-carbon sharing. First, a bidirectional carbon obligation transfer model with sensitivity coefficients is developed, enabling dynamic allocation of emission responsibilities based on prosumers’ energy sharing contributions. Second, we quantify prosumers’ preferences through a weighted triad index that integrates economic-social-carbon factors. Third, a supply-demand ratio (SDR) proposal combined with a modified stable matching algorithm is developed, achieving faster market clearing than conventional ADMM approaches while guaranteeing weak pareto-optimality. Implemented on an IEEE 33-bus system with 32 prosumers, the method can enhance the P2P sharing involvements, and encourage prosumers to choose cleaner energy and then reduce the total carbon emissions of cluster, demonstrating strong potential for demand-side management applications."}}
