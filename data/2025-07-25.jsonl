To highlight the approach, we assume that CBA has been conducted to evaluate twelve independent infrastructure and service projects, establishing their economic viability. Subsequently, PB is employed to elicit community preferences regarding the same projects, ensuring alignment with public values. The combined framework aims to reconcile technical efficiency with democratic legitimacy, promoting government outcomes that re lect both expert analysis and citizen priorities. Our indings reveal a strong community preference for projects that improve health outcomes and utility infrastructure, while initiatives focused on transport electri ication received comparatively low support. These results underscore the importance of incorporating public sentiment into investment decisions, particularly in sectors where societal bene its may be perceived differently than economic returns."}}

The SCHA does not apply to organizations outside of colleges and universities. However, the statute suggests that education and training are critical components of hazing prevention. In doing so, it raises the specter, in litigation, that other organizations that have a long history of hazing issues—e.g., collegiate fraternities and sororities—must similarly employ “research-informed” hazing prevention methods. Section I explores how liability is raised and adjudicated with respect to victims, chapter members, and chapters in hazing litigation.

Leveraging a comprehensive panel of U.S. manufacturing firms from 1978 to 2023, we exploit plausibly exogenous industry-level tariff reductions to assess how firms with high inventory turnover (HIT) versus low inventory turnover (LIT) are differentially affected by, and respond to, heightened competitive pressure. We find that LIT firms experience significant declines in sales growth, especially to non-major customers, and in stock returns following tariff reductions, whereas HIT firms are largely insulated from these negative effects and are shown to raise R&amp;D spending. Our findings suggest that HIT firms mitigate competitive shocks by retaining customers, especially those non-major ones, through relationship-specific investments. Additional tests rule out alternative explanations related to trade credit management, financing constraints, and labor productivity. Overall, the findings highlight the strategic value of inventory turnover as a key operational capability that enhances firms' resilience to intensified market competition."}}

For example, in Nigeria (4.9% of GDP), a 10% remittance increase could reduce its 203 yearly protests by about 2 events, while in Lebanon (28.4% of GDP), the same increase could add protests, reflecting heightened mobilization capacity. Using instrumental variables with oil price shocks, the analysis challenges linear assumptions about remittances' political effects and offers actionable insights for diaspora engagement in high-dependence states like Honduras, El Salvador, and Nepal, where traditional stabilization policies may backfire."}}

Historically the game has been dominated by male players, reinforcing the perception of golf as an “old boys club,” where access to influential networks is disproportionally available to men. This exclusivity creates a double-barreled impact, as it perpetuates systemic inequities that restrict women’s full participation in both leisure&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;professional settings. With only 26% of golfers identifying as women, the sport remains a male-dominated space amplifying the challenges of tokenism, statistical discrimination, and social closure.&nbsp;&nbsp;This imbalance also persists in the business world, where women hold only 29% of C-Suite positions and where 90% of CEOs golf. This study explores the interconnected structural, cultural, and historical barriers that contribute to the “grass ceiling,” by applying the frameworks of tokenism, statistical discrimination, and social closure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Findings from a survey of 323 business professionals reveal that women are more likely to encounter discrimination and perceive golf as less accessible than men. Moreover, the impact of tokenism heightens visibility pressures on women golfers, statistical discrimination reinforces gendered stereotypes, and social closure mechanisms maintain institutional barriers to access. Men, on the other hand, report higher satisfaction and greater perceived benefits from golf. To address these inequities, this study provides recommendations for the golf industry and business leaders to address structural barriers and modernize golf’s cultural narratives. By tackling these barriers, golf can move beyond its exclusionary past and become a more inclusive, equitable, environment in both leisure and professional settings.</p>"}}

Unlike conventional advertising, influencers have creative autonomy in content creation. This means that despite sponsorship agreements, influencers often prioritize their personal influencer salience (i.e., visibility) in visual content to preserve genuine connections with their community, at the expense of brand salience and the alignment of the content with the brand's visual communication style. To overcome this tension between brands and influencers, this research assesses the potential of visual generative AI (GenAI) to create visual brand content for sponsored posts. The authors develop a new visual GenAI workflow that is trained on influencer-, brand-, and social media visual content and compare the visual content it generates to conventional influencer content. Across four studies, this research shows that GenAI content with low-touch human input can improve the visual balance between brands and influencers, while maintaining perceived alignment with influencer and brand communication styles as well as influencer authenticity. The research also finds that sponsored collaborations involving GenAI are acceptable to influencers as well as to consumers when AI content creation is disclosed. Collectively, these findings underpin fundamental shifts in how sponsored influencer content is going to be created in the very near future."}}

Impulse buying may be triggered by cognitive and emotional triggers and is typically characterised by spontaneous and unplanned purchases. Neurocognitive training enhances cognitive and executive function like impulse control, working memory, and attention regulation and was used as an intervention as a way to reduce such behaviours. Methods: A sample of 120 participants (60 males and 60 females) completed pre-and post-intervention assessments using standardized measures of IBT. Results: Paired sample t-tests demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in scores for males (t = 13.09, p &lt; .001) and females (t = 11.12, p &lt; .001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 1.32 for males and d = 1.41 for females). The intervention showed a 100.0% improvement rate, and both males (19.0%) and females (19.3%) showed clinically meaningful reductions in IBT. An independent samples t-test indicated that there was no significant difference between the males and females in the effectiveness of training (t = 1.42, p &gt; .05). Conclusion: These figures indicate that neurocognitive exercise is a very effective, and the penis is neutral, intervention to reduce the behavior of buying impulses between young adults. Although these findings must be pushed and repeated, they will benefit the consumer initiatives and programs that teach economic self-regulation techniques."}}

Meanwhile, the integration of sustainable practices is being increasingly contemplated by luxury brands. However, integrating sustainability into the luxury fashion narrative within this region presents unique cultural and market-specific challenges. The reason for choosing this topic is based on the gap revealed in the research, which showed a lack of a comprehensive review of sustainable luxury in the Gulf region compared to other geographies like Europe. This systematic review seeks to critically examine the intersection between sustainability and luxury fashion consumption in the Gulf region by analyzing academic literature from the last 25 years. Specifically, it aims to identify consumer attitudes, examine the barriers to sustainability integration, and assess the extent to which global sustainability trends resonate within this unique cultural and economic context. Existing studies have primarily focused on four countries-the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait-highlighting the regional nature of this discourse. Employing the PRISMA methodology, this review analyzes academic literature published from 2000 to 2025. Sources were selected through comprehensive searches in major scholarly databases, including Elsevier ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. The review revealed that, despite a burgeoning global consciousness regarding sustainability, particularly among Generation Z and Millennials, there persists a discernible gap between consumer awareness and actual purchasing practices within the Gulf region. Furthermore, the concept of luxury is profoundly entrenched within the cultural fabric, accompanied by a limited understanding of sustainability challenges. Notable obstacles also exist in the adoption of circular economy principles within this area."}}

Subsequently, PB is employed to elicit community preferences regarding the same projects, ensuring alignment with public values. The combined framework aims to reconcile technical efficiency with democratic legitimacy, promoting government outcomes that re lect both expert analysis and citizen priorities. Our indings reveal a strong community preference for projects that improve health outcomes and utility infrastructure, while initiatives focused on transport electri ication received comparatively low support. These results underscore the importance of incorporating public sentiment into investment decisions, particularly in sectors where societal bene its may be perceived differently than economic returns."}}

Thereby, we estimate whether the lagged WB aid disbursed in a given state or province significantly explains variations observed in firm level employment within the same geographical region. The paper tests for firm level capital investments and access to finance, among others, as potential transmission channels for explaining observed impact of aid on employment. We find evidence in favor of positively significant association of WB aid disbursements with the firm level employment. The stability and significance of the observed impact both for permanent and temporary workers support our hypothesis that increased workers' demand induced by aid inflows is partly filled through shadow employment even by the formal sector enterprises. This, in a developing country context, may be a source of transformation and reduction in absolute poverty."}}

Platform managers face a strategic decision regarding these gifts: Some have embraced them as indicators of physician service quality to guide patients in physician selection, while others have hesitated due to uncertainty about whether patients offer gifts to reward services already received or to strategically secure future preferential care. Hence, platform managers require evidencebased guidance on implementing, regulating, or prohibiting this practice. However, fundamental questions about this emerging feedback method remain unexplored: Does monetary feedback reflect service quality received, and how does it compare to traditional written feedback in capturing service quality? Our study addresses these critical gaps by examining how physician service quality influences patient monetary feedback using patient-physician interaction data from a leading online healthcare platform. We analyze three dimensions of service quality: responsiveness, socio-emotional support, and informational support. Our analysis reveals several findings with important implications for information systems research and practice. First, while industry experts question monetary feedback as a quality measure, we find that patients give gifts based on the physician's responsiveness they have already experienced. This confirms that monetary feedback serves as a reliable quality indicator. Second, contrary to conventional wisdom that emphasizes socio-emotional and informational support in online healthcare, we find that neither dimension significantly influences patient gift-giving behavior. Third, while platforms have universally adopted written feedback based on validity assumptions, we find that written feedback fails to reflect any of the three service quality dimensions we examined. Monetary feedback, in contrast, captures quality aspects that written feedback misses entirely. Finally, while the industry focuses heavily on minimizing wait times because it assumes patients prefer quick responses, our analysis reveals a deeper mechanism that challenges this assumption. Specifically, patients value responsiveness not because they prefer faster service, but because responsiveness reflects physicians' commitment to their care. These findings would assist healthcare platforms in designing and implementing feedback methods, patients in examining reliable indicators of physician quality, and policymakers in regulating monetary feedback."}}

This article breaks new ground by recognizing both the inevitability and even desirability (in some instances) of AI hallucinations. We argue that defamation law must carve out “breathing space” for hallucinations, just as it treats certain human failings as “inevitable errors” to achieve sound communications policy. We further contend that LLM producers should be subject to a duty to warn users of the prevalence and risk of hallucinations as well as a duty to keep search records for a limited time to assist plaintiffs in proving reputational harm. Once AI producers comply with these obligations, the common law should treat them as information distributors.

The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and its extensions, such as the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), are essential for organizing and disseminating information related to infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for updating IDO and its virus-specific extensions. There is an additional need to update IDO extensions specific to bacteria, fungus, and parasite infectious diseases. Methods The \"hub-and-spoke\" methodology is adopted to generate pathogen-specific extensions of IDO: Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO), Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO), and Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO). Results IDO is introduced before reporting on the scopes, major classes and relations, applications and extensions of IDO to VIDO, BIDO, MIDO, and PIDO. Conclusions The creation of pathogen-specific reference ontologies advances modularization and reusability of infectious disease ontologies within the IDO ecosystem. Future work will focus on further refining these ontologies, creating new extensions, and developing application ontologies based on them, in line with ongoing efforts to standardize biological and biomedical terminologies for improved data sharing, quality, and analysis."}}

This article examines Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as a paradigmatic case of institutional transformation in strategic industries. More than a technological leader, TSMC has emerged as an institutional mediator-navigating overlapping policy regimes, supply chain fragmentation, and diverging state agendas. Drawing on TSMC's global expansion, especially its fabs in Arizona and Kumamoto, I show how firms are increasingly expected to perform quasi-sovereign functions: ensuring supply continuity, managing regulatory tensions, and absorbing geopolitical risk. I argue that prevailing discourses of \"decoupling\" and \"reshoring\" misdiagnose the problem, treating physical relocation as a proxy for strategic autonomy. Instead, I theorize institutional absorptive capacity as the foundation of long-term sovereignty: the ability of firms and states to learn, adapt, and coordinate across volatile environments. This requires shifting policy focus from industrial control to institutional designinvesting in learning systems, governance capacity, and trust-based cooperation. TSMC's trajectory thus signals a broader reconfiguration of state-firm boundaries and the emergence of a multipolar, narrative-driven political economy. The article concludes by outlining future research on cross-border institutional agency, strategic narrative construction, and techno-industrial governance beyond the U.S.-China binary."}}

However, they risk increasing food waste if customers add items solely to qualify. We analyze this tension with an economic model wherein a monopolistic online restaurant sells to two groups of rational customers (budget-conscious college students and affluent professionals, both with varying inherent demand) when there is a single threshold. Surprisingly, we find that profit improvement through the STD and waste reduction may not conflict, because the STD affects the restaurant profit through three channels: 1) Order size expansions: Buyers (i.e., customers that make purchases) whose basket values with inherent demand are just below the threshold add items, but their added values are often less than the discount value, causing profit loss and unnecessary consumption or waste; 2) Buyer base expansions: Customers deterred by delivery fees may buy if a low threshold enables the discount with minimal added values; 3) Profit margin enhancements: The threshold creates a sudden drop in effective average price, enabling restaurants to raise marginal food prices. Therefore, under certain conditions, increased customer aversion to waste can boost profits by curbing inefficient order size expansions without affecting the other two channels. Besides, regulators can achieve a rare triple win---reducing waste, increasing welfare, and maintaining restaurant profits---by capping platform fees. Overall, smarter pricing, consumer awareness, and balanced regulation can harmonize profitability with sustainability in delivery markets."}}

However, directly integrating drone flight dynamics into the combinatorially hard truck route planning problem is challenging. Simplified models that ignore drone flight physics can lead to suboptimal delivery plans. We propose an integrated formulation for the joint problem of truck route and drone trajectory planning and a new end-to-end solution approach that combines optimization and machine learning to generate high-quality solutions in practical online runtimes. Our solution method trains neural network predictors based on offline solutions to the drone trajectory optimization problem instances to approximate drone flight times, and uses these approximations to optimize the overall truck-and-drone delivery plan by augmenting an existing order-first-split-second heuristic. Our method explicitly incorporates key kinematics and energy equations in drone trajectory optimization, and thereby outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks that ignore drone flight physics. Extensive experimentation using synthetic datasets and real-world case studies shows that the integration of drone trajectories into package delivery planning substantially improves system performance in terms of tour duration and drone energy consumption. Our modeling and computational framework can help delivery planners achieve annual savings worth millions of dollars while also benefiting the environment."}}

This paper investigates how optimal pricing and platform profitability are affected by the design of such systems—specifically, whether a platform displays one score across multiple products (aggregate system) or individual scores for each product (disaggregate system). Methodology/Results: We develop an analytical model where a set of substitutable products are sold through an online platform, and consumer demand is governed by the multinomial logit (MNL) framework. Ratings influence product attractiveness and market share, which in turn shapes future ratings. We compare aggregate and disaggregate rating systems across three pricing scenarios: exogenous prices, centralized pricing, and decentralized pricing. Our analysis reveals that rating design significantly alters equilibrium pricing strategies: the aggregate system yields differentiated markups across products, while the disaggregate system leads to uniform margins. Surprisingly, under centralized pricing, both systems generate identical total profit for the platform despite these contrasting price structures. This result highlights a novel form of strategic equivalence shaped by rating-based externalities. Under decentralized pricing, rating design continues to shape equilibrium outcomes, though the implications become more nuanced. Managerial Implications: Our findings offer new insights into the interplay between information design and pricing strategy in multi-product environments. Platform operators can use these insights to design rating systems that balance transparency, competitive positioning, and profitability. Even when transparency affects individual product performance, the platform may still achieve equivalent profitability through strategic price adjustments, depending on its control over pricing.</span><span></span>"}}

This study focuses on changes in firms’ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) messaging in job postings post-IPO by differentiating standardized diversity statements from tailored inclusive language. Text analysis of online job postings reveals no significant change in diversity statements but a notable increase in the discussion of inclusive work climate post-IPO. The positive effect is more pronounced among firms with substantial growth pressures and hiring demand. The study demonstrates that firms’ diversity claims in job postings are driven more by changes in their strategic labor market objectives than by shifts in the normative environment.</p>"}}

The existence of IFE, GFE or NSTW has significant implications for identification, estimation, and inference, leading to the development of many new estimators for panel data models. This paper provides an accessible review of the new estimation methods and their associated diagnostic tests, and offers a guide to empirical practice. In two separate empirical investigations we demonstrate that there is empirical support for the new forms of fixed effects and that the results can differ significantly from those obtained using traditional fixed effects estimators."}}

It contributes to recent work on tractable macroeconomic agent-based models (ABMs) by comparing two versions of the model: an ABM with bilateral firm-customer matching, and a simplified HAM without direct agent interaction. The HAM replicates key ABM results while allowing for analytical solutions. The model captures how pricing, investment, and market concentration evolve at the micro level and affect macro-level outcomes. Firms differ in capital size and market share. Larger firms benefit from lower unit costs due to economies of scale, gain larger market shares, and charge higher markups. At the same time, customers seek lower prices, creating competitive pressure. These mechanisms drive endogenous changes in the firm size distribution. More profitable firms temporarily grow faster, leading to concentration of capital, market shares, and markups. These dynamics lead to right-skewed distributions, producing a divergence between the average profit share across firms and the aggregate profit share, which is driven up by the biggest firms. The fall in the labour share reduces consumption and slows down growth. Despite its simplicity, the model captures key empirical patterns related to superstar firms and declining labour shares."}}

Using difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs, we find that RAIO dramatically reduced homicides and property crimes, likely through deterrence rather than incapacitation, as arrests also declined. A citizen survey with 2,000 respondents and embedded experiments shows that RAIO is perceived as more effective, less corrupt, and less abusive than other forces. We demonstrate that RAIO's success did not increase human rights abuses, provided substantial social benefits relative to operational costs, and helped the incumbent governor electorally.

However, this architectural shift introduces significant challenges in synchronizing data across heterogeneous cloud platforms in real time. Traditional batch synchronization techniques fail to meet the low-latency and high-throughput demands of modern applications. This paper presents a robust, scalable, and real-time data synchronization architecture leveraging Kafka Stream Processing to ensure consistency and continuity of data across multiple cloud environments. The proposed solution uses Apache Kafka as the central backbone for reliable message brokering and employs Kafka Streams for real-time stream processing, transformation, and enrichment. By strategically deploying Kafka clusters and Kafka Connect across cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, this architecture enables bi-directional, fault-tolerant, and schema-compliant data replication. Features such as exactly-once semantics, stateful stream transformations, and windowing operations are utilized to maintain strong consistency even during failures or network partitions. Additionally, schema evolution and data validation are supported using Schema Registry integrated with Avro serialization, ensuring interoperability across distributed systems. A comprehensive monitoring layer with Prometheus, Grafana, and Kafka Cruise Control supports observability, performance tuning, and operational resilience. Through simulated test scenarios and case studies, the system demonstrates low synchronization latency (&lt; 2 seconds), high throughput (&gt; 100K msgs/sec), and seamless failover across cloud regions. This research proves that Kafka Stream Processing is not only suitable but highly effective for multi-cloud data synchronization use cases, offering a powerful solution for modern, data-intensive, and distributed enterprise workloads."}}

This paper builds on Ayres' instrumental/ceremonial dichotomy by analyzing behavior commonly seen in the manufacturing environment. In modern industrial systems. Fisher Information enables predictive measurement to extract a high-value instrumental signal, while a parallel layer of ceremonial deliberation reinforces and legitimizes those instrumental choices. Industrial process control technology, widely applied in practice, not only demonstrates how individuals are organized to reduce noise and generate value but also reveals how ceremonial processes-such as regulatory validation and cultural endorsement-remain indispensable for sustaining long-term economic progress."}}

Using statistical, machine learning, and natural language methods, we find that: (i) government entities win appeals at nearly twice the rate of private parties (62% overall); (ii) worse budget balances correlate with increased pro-government rulings; (iii) when the government loses high-impact cases, the Court modulates decision effects in over 68% of them to reduce budgetary impact; and (iv) consequentialist reasoning increasingly appears in STF opinions during crises. These patterns persist regardless of the ruling party's political orientation, suggesting a structural dynamic in fiscal judicial decisions.

This project seeks to design and develop a responsive web application that provides a centralized platform for tracking pandemic cases, predicting future outbreaks, issuing real-time notifications, and disseminating verified news updates to users. The design, development, and implementation of pandemic monitoring systems have become critical in public health infrastructure, particularly in responding to fast-spreading diseases such as COVID-19 and Ebola. Existing systems, such as WHO dashboards and CDC outbreak trackers, provide important functionalities but often lack features like integrated AI prediction, user-specific alerts, and local community-level data display—features which our proposed system addresses. The methodology and tools used for the development and deployment of this system follow the AGILE METHODOLOGY for its iterative and user-centered development process. Tools and technologies include Next.js, Node.js, MySQL, Tailwind CSS, and real-time data APIs. System testing showed the platform successfully tracked and visualized case data, allowed admin management of news and user roles, and delivered real-time alerts and notifications. The system also featured an AI-driven chatbot and prediction model to assist users in decision-making.

Our key insight is that currency unions may experience endogenous breakings of symmetry: that is episodes in which identical countries react differently when exposed to the same shock. During these events, part of the union suffers a capital flight, while the rest acts as a safe haven and receives capital inflows. The central bank then faces a difficult trade-off between containing unemployment in capital-flight countries and inflationary pressures in safe-haven ones. By counteracting private capital flows with public ones, anti-fragmentation monetary programs mitigate the impact of financial fragmentation on employment and inflation, thus helping the central bank to fulfil its price stability mandate."}}

The research examines how urban development, land use, population, and industry influence WSDC and its spatial heterogeneity. Our findings reveal that from 2013 to 2022, water supply in the YRB exhibited a spatial pattern of higher supply in the south and lower supply in the north. While overall water supply increased, some northwestern regions experienced a decline. Water demand was concentrated in high-value areas in the northwest and east, though it generally decreased over time. (2) Urban WSDC demonstrated significant spatial agglomeration, with higher capacity in the south and greater pressure in the northwest and central regions. Concurrently, the number of cities classified as \"safe\" decreased annually, while those with \"high-sensitivity\" status increased. Using the optimized GeoDetector model and Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR), we identified key factors influencing WSDC, including average irrigation water use per acre, per capita water resources, and the nighttime light index. These factors varied across years and locations, underscoring the need for tailored water management strategies. (3) Effective water resource management in the YRB must consider the interplay of urban development, land use, population, and industry. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to mitigate water supply-demand conflicts through targeted management of these factors."}}

The analysis covers a range of U.S. technology stocks, including both well-established large-cap firms and newer AI-focused companies. The GSADF test is employed to detect episodes of explosive price behavior, while the MS-GARCH model captures volatility regime shifts that may accompany speculative phases. The results indicate that among the stocks analyzed, only NVIDIA and Tesla exhibited statistically significant bubble-like dynamics, notably around 2019 and again in early 2024, reflecting episodes of heightened market optimism unrelated to the initial surge in generative AI enthusiasm. Other firms commonly associated with the AI theme such as Meta, Snowflake, Palantir, and MongoDB did not show clear signs of speculative price behavior over the observed period. These findings suggest that the recent AI boom has not led to widespread asset price bubbles across the sector but has instead been concentrated in a small number of key stocks. The study emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between structural valuation growth and speculative acceleration when evaluating emerging technology markets. Limitations related to sample size and test sensitivity are also discussed to inform future research."}}

Caste endogamy contributes to the unequal transfer of social capital and social endowments, thereby reproducing inequalities within and across generations. In this background, the study examined the question of whether Inter-caste marriages contribute to reducing economic inequality in children's nutrition. We triangulated analyses based on pooled microdata and macro-panel data compiled from the National Family Health Survey and other Government surveys (2005-2021). The Wagstaff's corrected concentration index, panel data random effects regression models, and pooled cross-sectional probit regression model have been used. Findings suggest the continued prevalence of caste-based assortative sorting in the Indian marriage market and wealth-based inequalities in child nutritional status, thereby indicating both strong caste endogamy and health inequalities. However, an increase in Inter-caste marriage is associated with declining inequalities in the child nutrition indicators: stunting, wasting, and underweight. The pathway is established through the reduced economic heterogeneity in populations owing to inter-caste marital arrangements and a greater possibility of exchange of resources. Thus, we advance that Inter-caste marriages lessen caste inequalities in child nutrition in India by narrowing group differences in socioeconomic status."}}

To better analyze the regulatory approaches, this Article identifies four distinct regulatory strategies: substance-oriented rules, process-oriented rules, substance-oriented standards, and process-oriented standards. The findings show that Chinese courts currently utilize the first three approaches. They apply both rules and standards, but the standards are predominantly substance-oriented.

It argues that institutional constraints do not constitute insurmountable barriers. Chinese courts are already working with open-ended standards in several types of corporate disputes.

The model aims to address the limitations of traditional recycling systems, which often rely on static government subsidies and fail to generate sustained public participation. By introducing dynamic token values linked to realworld supply and demand conditions, as well as incorporating non-monetary behavioral drivers (e.g., social norms, reputational incentives), the framework creates a dual-incentive structure that can adapt over time. The model uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate outcomes under a range of scenarios involving operational costs, carbon pricing, token volatility, and behavioral adoption rates. Due to the absence of real-world implementations of such integrated blockchain-based recycling systems, the paper remains theoretical and simulationbased. It is intended as a prototype framework for future policy experimentation and pilot projects. The model provides insights for policymakers, urban planners, and technology developers aiming to explore decentralized and market-responsive solutions to sustainable waste management.

Using a sample of Japanese listed firms from 2002 to 2023, we find that management earnings forecasts are more accurate than ML earnings forecasts. Among the three ML models, deep neural networks achieve the highest forecasting accuracy, followed by k-nearest neighbors and then random forest. These findings underscore the informational advantage of corporate managers in forecasting firm performance, despite recent advances in ML. They also suggest that the choice of algorithm matters: more complex models such as deep neural networks may outperform simpler alternatives when predicting future earnings."}}

While ABMs may be well-suited to capture these interactions, their simulations can be computationally expensive. A promising solution is the use of machine learning-based meta-models, or surrogates, which approximate the ABM outputs without the need to run the whole simulation. While previous research has primarily used machine learning for sensitivity analysis and calibration, this paper presents a novel technique by employing machine learning surrogates to forecast the outcome of policy interventions in the Keynes meeting Schumpeter ABM, by training the machine learning models on the results of various simulations. Five machine learning techniques-XGBoost, feed-forward artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest, K-nearest neighbors-are evaluated for their ability to predict different macroeconomic variables, and model performance is assessed using the mean squared error to identify the surrogate that most accurately forecasts ABM outputs. Results indicate XGBoost methods as the best approximation of the ABM output. The current research thus contributes to the field by providing a computationally efficient approach for policy evaluation in ABMs and may provide additional insights for the design of more informed economic interventions via the use of simulation methods."}}

It introduces an aid identification model treating aid allocation as a simultaneous optimization problem, considering the perceived costs and benefits for both donors and recipients. Empirical results reveal no consistent, statistically significant evidence in support of a vanguard effect. While Chinese aid shows some positive, though inconsistent, association with Chinese FDI, this pattern is less evident for the U.S. Notably, higher U.S. aid correlates with increased Chinese FDI, but higher Chinese aid does not lead to more U.S. FDI. Improving trade balances with the U.S. attracts FDI from both countries, whereas similar improvements with China may crowd out Chinese FDI. Economic variables largely explain U.S. FDI, whereas Chinese FDI, in the presence of Chinese aid, is more influenced by political factors. Chinese aid boosts FDI via increased state involvement but deters it when state capacity and productivity rise. Regionally, U.S. aid positively affects FDI in Sub-Saharan Africa, while Chinese aid and FDI are significantly correlated in East Asia and the Pacific. The findings suggest recipient countries may face a trade-off between the Eagle and the Dragon: attracting U.S. FDI may require openness, stronger institutions, and export growth, while courting Chinese FDI in the presence of Chinese aid could come at the expense of these very factors."}}

Nevertheless, on the contrary, shadow banking also has the associated dangers as evidenced by the 2008 financial meltdown which demonstrated how its unregulated nature leads to systemic instability. In this regard, several key points have been highlighted in this paper to understand the associated risks and thus the need for policies to ensure potential risks are properly handled.

Using state-level data on vehicle registrations during 2015-2022, we estimate how vehicle net survival varies with vehicle age, class, and state employment, income, and population. Although our data does not disentangle scrappage from migration, our analysis indicates substantial and persistent flows of 2- to 10-year-old vehicles among states that respond to differences in economic and population growth and other state attributes with potentially important implications for the diffusion of advanced automotive technologies.

Unlike most studies, however, we can leverage detailed usage data from the flipped cohort, including the timeliness and completeness of pre-class video watching, as well as quiz participation patterns, to check how well students implemented each part of the curriculum. Our findings suggest that, on average, students in the flipped cohort implemented the instructional approach insufficiently, explaining the mechanism of our null results in exam performance and knowledge retention.

Since the collapse of the USSR the border under study has been transforming due to the aspirations of certain post-Soviet countries as well as&nbsp;the expanding scope of the Euro-Atlantic integration. The study is based on the survey of the MGIMO first-year students who drew the border between Eastern and Western Europe on a map and answered questions on travel frequency and Russia’s belonging to Europe. Three waves of the survey have been conducted sofar: in 2022 (before February 22), 2023 and 2024. This group of the respondents is of special interest, because they may form the core of Russia’s diplomacy in future. According to the survey, the “main” border of Western and Eastern Europe lies along the following route: the border between Russia and Finland — the Finnish Gulf — the Baltic Sea — the border between Poland and Germany — the border between the Check Republic and Germany — the border between the Check Republic and Austria — the border between Austria and Slovakia — the border between Austria and Hungary. This pattern overall remained the same over the whole period, however, in 2023 and 2024 the border became clearer, for instance, Croatia was more rarely identified as an Eastern European state, and the Baltics were more rarely attached to Western Europe. More frequent travelers were inclined to provide a more detailed and less stereotype pattern of the border. The study revealed unexpected gender differences in answers: women were more likely to push the border of the Eastern Europe closer to Russia."}}

Using experimentation, we find that investors are misled by firms outsourcing emissions to the unreported Scope 3 category. Although disclosing Scope 3 emissions metrics attenuates favorable views toward “carbon outsourcers,” the ambiguity surrounding the reasons for emissions changes hinders investors from fully differentiating between carbon outsourcers and carbon insourcers. However, including qualitative explanations helps reduce this ambiguity. Our findings highlight the importance of comprehensive emissions disclosures in improving transparency and helping investors to make informed decisions, offering valuable implications for regulators and policymakers."}}

Using complementary empirical strategies at the individual, household, and regional level, I find that remote work reduces the child penalty by about 4 percentage points, relative to a baseline penalty of nearly 17 points. These effects operate through three main channels: (i) women in occupations that can be done from home are more likely to remain in their pre-child job; (ii) recent mothers are more likely to transition into remote work; (iii) women whose partners can work from home are more likely to remain employed.

The fall of the USSR thirty years ago brought an end to Russia’s direct political rule over Central Asia. But the arrival of formal independence was not matched by a parallel decoupling of the deeper structure of legal and institutional regimes. Something broadly similar had happened before to the former British and French colonies. What distinguishes the Central Asian case, however, is the vector of the formal shift – Central Asian states gained independence from the preeminent power of the ‘Second World’, not the ‘First World’– and the rather distinct character of the post-independence transition processes. In many cases, these processes, choreographed and coordinated through a network of international institutions not existent at &nbsp;the time of the previous wave of decolonisation, were shaped not just by a local aspiration towards independence but also an intense external pressure to adopt a particular combination of Western-style legal and political reform packages. A large part of what accounts for the way this pressure came to be practised was the rise of a certain kind of international law imaginary: a combination&nbsp;of sanctioned ignorance, a firm belief in 'legal science', and a version of 'civilising mission'. The one crucial element that brought this complex together at the ideological level &nbsp;was the consistent exoticization of Central Asia via the implicit denial of its postcolonial status. The structural shift that allowed it to turn into a practically active legal regime was the replacement of the traditional modes of international coercion with modern-day techniques of 'adverse publicity'. As one set of colonial forms and dynamics gave way to another, the question of Central Asia's postcoloniality, already made ideologically opaque by the ‘second-worldist’ origins of the Soviet empire, quickly receded further into the background. What made this process of obfuscation even more effective at the theoretical level, in international law, was the persisting failure on the part of the international law academia to maintain any degree of &nbsp;interest in the region. As the task of determining how international law and its institutions should approach and understand Central Asia essentially fell to non-lawyers, the resulting narrative about Central Asia and its place in the international arena took on increasingly neocolonialist overtones of the kind one would rarely see admitted in relation to other non-Western regions. The fact that the predominant mode of thinking postcoloniality in international legal thought at this time took the form of 'Third World Approaches to International Law' certainly did not help, as it helped relegate Central Asia even further beyond the limits of critical attention among the discipline's critically attuned scholarly segment. This chapter is an attempt to push back against this trend. In critiquing the traditional international law conception of Central Asia that has emerged over the last thirty years and in rethinking the&nbsp;shape of Central Asia's (legal) postcoloniality, it offers reflections not only about&nbsp;the basic relationship between post-Sovietness and postcoloniality&nbsp;but also the broader challenge of conceptualising decolonisation, neocolonialism, and postcoloniality in international legal thought.</p>"}}

We consider an infinitely repeated Tullock contest in which players with concave utility allocate resources between consumption and costly effort, and the prizes from the current competition determine the players' endowments in the subsequent period. We characterize the unique pure-strategy Markov Perfect Equilibrium, proving that the highly endowed player exerts more effort and has a higher probability of winning. Social competition is maximized at an intermediate level of inequality, whereas utilitarian social welfare is maximized under full equality. Assuming non-increasing absolute risk aversion preferences, we find that greater inequality monotonically reduces social mobility (a pattern consistent with the Great Gatsby curve) and lowers the welfare of the lowly endowed player. By contrast, the welfare of the highly endowed player is non-monotonic when the discount factor is sufficiently high. Thus, being richer in a more unequal society does not necessarily imply higher individual welfare. For example, under logarithmic utility and = 2=3, an individual must control over 88% of total resources to strictly prefer inequality over full equality."}}

Based on five rounds of survey data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) from 2011-2019, which are matched with meteorological data at the county levels, this paper assesses the microeconomic consequences of climate change by identifying the causal effect of temperature change on the financial vulnerability of rural households in China. It is found that climate warming significantly exacerbates the financial vulnerability of rural households, with the likelihood of a rural household being financially vulnerable increasing by 3.16% for every 1°C increase in average temperature. Mechanism tests indicate that climate warming mainly exacerbates financial vulnerability by lowering household income and elevating health risks and credit constraints. Heterogeneity analyses show that the impacts of climate warming are significantly pro-poor at the household and regional levels. Based on the temperature change paths in the middle (2040-2069) and long-term (2070-2099) of the 21st century, this paper predicts the potential impacts of future global warming on the financial vulnerability of China&apos;s farm households. The results show that future global warming may increase the proportion of farm households in financial distress in China by 3.99%-8.38% in the medium term and by 5.38%-11.48% in the long term. This paper provides a new perspective on the economic consequences of climate change from the perspective of micro households, as well as micro evidence of the importance of consolidating and expanding the achievements of poverty eradication, comprehensively promoting the strategy of rural revitalization, and actively andsteadily advancing the dual-carbon strategy."}}

Unguided online interventions require no human contact and are therefore easier to implement on a large scale than guided interventions. However, effectiveness and adherence rates to these interventions are generally lower. One way to increase adherence to unguided online interventions is to offer automated motivational support.ObjectiveThis pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined whether adherence to unguided online CBT for low mood could be improved by adding automated support in the form of smartphone-delivered personalized motivational messages or a motivational virtual coach integrated into the online intervention.MethodsA three-arm pilot RCT (n = 106) was conducted that compared an online intervention delivered with automated motivational support by a virtual coach (n = 35), or by automated personalized messages on their smartphone (n = 35), to the same intervention without support (control condition; n ­= 36). The primary outcome was level of adherence, operationalized as (1) the number of webpages of the intervention visited, and (2) the number of mood ratings completed on the smartphone application, both retrieved from participants’ logfiles. Secondary outcomes were satisfaction with the intervention (CSQ-I), usability (SUS) depression scores (HADS), and motivation for treatment (SMFL), measured through online questionnaires administered at baseline or after 4 weeks (post-intervention).ResultsAdherence was moderate overall, with participants visiting a range of 21 to 25 of the 55 webpages and completing 48 to 57 of the 84 mood ratings. No evidence for differences in adherence rates were observed between the intervention conditions and the control condition. Satisfaction with the intervention was moderate to high. Usability scores were below the desirable threshold of 68. Depression symptoms showed a small decrease across participants (Cohen’s d = .21), though this change was not statistically significant (p = .053). Participants across all conditions scored highest on the identified motivation subscale. ConclusionsAdding automated support to unguided online CBT for depression did not improve overall adherence. The limited effectiveness may reflect a misalignment between the motivational strategies and the needs of the target population, who reported mild symptoms and high intrinsic motivation. The findings highlight the need to further improve both the quality of automated support and the usability of online platform. Future research should explore additional adherence-related factors and investigate how personalization can better address different symptom severities in unguided mental health interventions."}}

The results show that early-life exposure to the NIP has beneficial effects on educational attainment and cognitive and non-cognitive skills in adulthood. The program also has sustained effects on improving emotional well-being and reducing engagement in risky health behaviors. Furthermore, the human capital benefits of the NIP are more pronounced among children from lower socioeconomic status households. This study reveals the enduring effects of school meal programs and highlights that school-based nutrition interventions should not be viewed merely as nutritional supplementation initiatives, but rather as broader human development programs."}}

It is made clear that such tools cannot dissolve corporate bodies and suspend the functioning of the shareholders' meeting.

In this context, it is responsible for enforcing relevant EU and national legislation. However, Member States' legislation may differ from European law. One example is the Italian extraordinary administration. This procedure, which falls somewhere between early intervention measures and administrative compulsory liquidation, differs in many respects from the provisions of Article 29, BRRD.

After imputing missing bedroom counts and stratifying the sample by income category, the study constructs density measures such as rooms per household and bedrooms per house. Pearson statistics show that median household income has the strongest positive association with price (ρ = 0.687). Density ratios add secondary explanatory power, whereas population size, housing age, and geographic coordinates offer limited insight once income is considered. A five hundred thousand dollar price ceiling introduces censoring at the upper tail, and strong correlations among room and population counts reveal multicollinearity. The findings indicate that income is the principal source of price dispersion along the California coast, while dwelling composition refines but does not overturn this relationship."}}
