However, decision makers often rely heavily on the first piece of information, leading to insufficient adjustments from this initial value, a cognitive bias known as anchoring. While there is extensive laboratory and empirical literature on anchoring, theoretical models exploring the impact of this bias on the implementation of personalized pricing are relatively scarce. Methodology/results: We develop a personalized pricing model, and analytically characterize a seller's personalized pricing and procurement decisions based on their information processing behavior. We find that anchoring bias reduces the likelihood of the seller engaging in price discrimination. As a result, the seller may shift from a discriminatory pricing policy to setting a uniformly high (resp. low) price in a low (resp. high) profit margin market as he becomes more biased. Interestingly, a seller with higher procurement costs does not necessarily experience lower profit. Managerial implications: Our findings offer valuable insights into the design and implementation of strategies to improve pricing and inventory decisions while mitigating executives' anchoring bias. Furthermore, the results suggest that sourcing from the lowest-cost supplier may not always yield optimal outcomes for firms."}}

This framework highlights the interaction between two cognitive systems: the Arithmetic Calculation (AC) system, which performs rule-based operations, and the Magnitude Estimation (ME) system, which relies on perceptual estimations of magnitude. The AC system facilitates operations such as addition and subtraction, while the ME system enables perceptual estimates of magnitudes informed by the mental number line. Through the lens of the AC-ME framework, we provide new insights into behavioral pricing effects, such as the left-digit effect, price partitioning, reference prices, multi-tier discounts, quantity framing, the rating format effect, and the price precision effect. These behavioral pricing effects illustrate how arithmetic calculations (AC) and perceptual magnitude estimations (ME) jointly influence price evaluations. Contrary to the view that these errors in numeric judgments are irrational, the AC-ME framework posits that they are rooted in cognitive mechanisms with adaptive rationality. While perceptual estimations can sometimes cause deviations from the answers of arithmetic calculations, they play a crucial and beneficial role in everyday numerical judgments."}}

This socially responsible initiative, where retailers request consumer donations during the payment process, has enabled retailers to support nonprofits in reaching broader audiences. However, it remains unclear how operational factors preceding the donation request affect consumers' donations. Understanding this relationship is critical for retailers seeking to maximize their social impact and for nonprofits facing persistent funding gaps. In this paper, we examine how waiting time influences checkout charity donations and identify strategies retailers can implement to manage this relationship. We conduct five online experiments simulating virtual queuing environments. Our findings reveal that queue management affects not only consumer experience but also charitable giving effectiveness. We find that longer waiting times decrease consumer donations by lowering consumer satisfaction. We then explore how retailers can manage this relationship through operational and informational levers. Capacity expansion increases consumer donations, while process transparency reduces donations by exposing perceived inefficiencies. Informational levers such as providing donation usage information prove effective for short waits while highlighting highly visible causes boosts donations even under long wait conditions. Our findings provide actionable guidance for retailers implementing checkout charity programs, enabling them to better support nonprofit partners while strengthening their social responsibility initiatives and contributing to broader societal welfare."}}

The market perceives Sukuk as \"Shariah compliant bonds\" exhibiting a hybrid character-behaving like fixed-income debt during normal operations but transforming into equity-like positions (contingent equity) upon issuer default. We present this perspective as the Sukuk as Equity-at-Default (EaD) hypothesis. However, the Shariah academies prefer Sukuk to be treated as temporary or permanent equity clearly distinct from common equities and bonds. This dichotomy clearly leads to a tension between the Market (investor protection and default management) and the Ethics (alignment between form and substance). This tension is counterproductive for the development of Sukuk markets. To analyze and resolve this tension, we apply the Dynamic Prescriptive Economics (DPE) four quadrant framework to assess Sukuk design along two dimensions: (1) alignment of form with substance, and (2) effectiveness of distress management. The DPE methodology explains our analytical approach, combining conceptual modeling with case studies. The main analysis elucidates how sukuk confers genuine asset ownership rights that grant investors equity-like control in default scenarios, affecting risk assessment and pricing. The case studies support the EaD hypothesis and lead to the core conclusion-a Sukuk is a Sukuk because it is Equity-at-Default. We argue that the EaD paradigm is unique to Sukuk and central to Quadrant I: where the dual character of sukuk (debt-like security in good times, equity-like risk bearing upon default) is optimized, made enforceable, and designed as a practical feature-not just an academic distinction. Merely designing sukuk as permanent or temporary equity in a legal form without strong distress effectiveness or focusing only on theoretical compliance (as in the Shariah academy's viewpoint), would place Sukuk elsewhere (Quadrant IV or II). Thus, Quadrant I explicitly prefers and enhances the practical, enforceable EaD model over both pure as equity models and debt mimics. We discuss enforcement mechanisms, jurisdictional variability, and practical hurdles that can undermine sukuk holders' rights. Finally, the paper offers Conclusion and Recommendations for market development and legal reforms to enhance sukuk's unique value proposition-aligning Shariah principles with economic substance and strengthening investor protection in defaults. This forward-looking roadmap advocates for innovations in sukuk structuring, standardized legal frameworks, and adaptive strategies (Substitution, Transformation, Offsets) to transition sukuk from their current form-dominant model toward a robust risk-sharing paradigm."}}

Cronbach Alpha was used to ascertain the reliability index of ACAI which gave reliability value of 0.87. The internal consistency of ACPT was tested using Kuder-Richardson (KR-21) formula which yielded a reliability value of 0.96. The population was 7,152 SS2 students offering chemistry in Makurdi, Benue State, Nigeria. A sample of 157 students drawn from 3 schools in Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State, Nigeria was selected using multi-stage sampling techniques. Four research questions and four null hypotheses guided the study. The research questions were answered using Mean and Standard Deviation scores while the null hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance using results from Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The study revealed among others, that there was no significant difference between the mean attention rating of male and female students taught analytical chemistry {F1, 78 = 1.020, P&gt;0.05}. It was also revealed that that there is no significant difference between the mean academic performance of male and female students taught analytical chemistry using CPEOE {F1, 78 = 4.890, P&gt;0.05}. It was recommended among others that since CPEOE is not gender sensitive. Hence, both male and female students should be involved in CPEOE classroom to enhance their attention and academic performance in analytical chemistry. Serving teachers should be encouraged to use CPEOE in teaching analytical chemistry concepts."}}

However, little is known about the determinants and real effects of bond roadshows. This paper examines why firms decide to conduct a roadshow when issuing bonds and their real effects on the cost of bonds-a literature gap possibly due to a lack of readily available data, which we had to manually collect. We conduct surveys with underwriters and issuers to gain their insights on the role of bond roadshows and obtain two conflicting answers: according to underwriters, bond roadshows have an informational role, while according to issuers, they have a marketing role. We test these opposing views in the German bond market (2014-2023), finding evidence in support of the marketing role. We show that bond roadshows aim to raise investors' attention and increase their demand in the primary market, possibly to establish a network of institutional investors. The different role that bond roadshows have compared to equity roadshows underscores the importance of closing the literature gap and studying their real effects. We test and find that bond roadshows reduce the cost of bonds for firms, reducing bonds' final spread and substituting for the need for underpricing to ensure successful issuance. These findings offer novel insights into the role of the investors' networks in bond markets, highlighting how roadshows influence capital-raising outcomes."}}

Evidence suggests that the increase in reported growth is driven by over-reporting of income and inter-temporal income shifting to maximize tax reductions.

We develop a formal model grounded in Public Choice Theory and Perception of Fairness framework, in which a politician strategically decides whether to implement a salary increase, anticipating voter reactions in terms of institutional trust. The model predicts that trust may decline when reforms are perceived to reflect political self-interest. We empirically test this mechanism using the 2009 harmonization of salaries for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), which standardized remuneration across EU member states. Drawing on Eurobarometer survey data from 2004 to 2014 and employing an Interrupted Time Series design, we find a significant and persistent decline in trust in the European Parliament following the reform. These findings suggest that political remuneration not only affects institutional structures but also conditions perceived legitimacy through the lens of voter interpretation."}}

We investigate learning mechanisms using European men's football-a setting that overcomes key limitations of linked employer employee administrative data. Unlike these datasets, we observe direct collaboration (passes between players), better estimated and frequently-updated human capital measures (transfer market values) that alleviates wage rigidity, and professional skill evolution. We confirm that 10% higher peer quality associates with 3% higher wage growth. However, we uncover previously hidden mechanisms: First, conditional on average quality, team composition and exposure to stars do not affect learning. Second, better peers reduce individual playing time, causing standard estimates to underestimate learning effects by 30%. Third, intensive collaboration with high-quality peers drives learning-one standard deviation more passes with top colleagues yields 10% higher wage growth. Fourth, peer effects manifest in learnable skills (passing, reactions) but not innate abilities (speed), providing evidence against selection bias. Finally, learning persists after job changes, suggesting genuine human capital accumulation rather than temporary complementarities. Our granular production data reveals that workplace learning depends critically on direct interaction opportunities, not mere proximity to talent."}}

Using a neo-Schumpeterian historical political economy perspective, it traces the evolution of modernisation models in CEE across four major periods: interwar, socialist, post-socialist, and post-neoliberal phases. The paper conceptualises modernisation as a structural pendulum, with CEE economies oscillating between foreign-led growth driven by external finance, technology, and markets and domestic-led efforts focused on strategic autonomy and national industrial capacity. Empirical cases from Romania, Poland, and Hungary, as well as sectoral evidence from the electronics and automotive industries, illustrate the persistent tensions and trade-offs between these models. The analysis shows that neither pure FLM nor DLM ensures sustainable catching-up; rather, deliberate coupling between foreign integration and domestic capability-building is essential for long-term innovation-driven growth. Drawing comparative insights from East Asia, Brazil, Malaysia, Ireland, and East Germany, the paper argues that without institutionalised coupling mechanisms, CEE risks being locked into a middle innovation trap. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of current geopolitical shifts and EU industrial policy debates for the future trajectories of CEE modernisation."}}

Moving beyond binary presence/absence coding, the index captures depth, specificity, and enforceability through four thematic categories combined with eleven transparent weighting schemes. Panel estimates with Driscoll-Kraay errors demonstrate empirical validity: a 10% increase in annual forest-cover loss raises the EDI by 1.5% while 10% larger forest stock reduces it by 4.8%, confirming that governments strengthen treaty language when degradation becomes visible but ease commitments where forests remain abundant. Outward FDI exhibits positive association with deeper commitments (elasticity 0.138), and income effects trace the inverted-U predicted by environmental Kuznets curves. Rank correlations across weighting schemes exceed 0.996, establishing methodological robustness. Although only 23% of agreements contain explicit forest clauses, those that do effectively offset deforestation pressures linked to trade liberalization. When forest-specific provisions receive priority weighting, Europe and Central Asia achieve the highest regional scores (46 points), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (33 points), revealing patterns invisible to simple clause counts. The index provides the first comprehensive, theoretically-grounded tool for measuring environmental ambition in trade agreements, offering negotiators a practical benchmark and researchers a versatile instrument for analyzing trade-environment dynamics."}}

However, elections and elected politicians are subject to influence from other political actors, such as Special Interest Groups. We develop a political agency model with moral hazard and adverse selection, in which a lobby uses campaign finance and the media as instruments to influence the political system. In equilibrium, the resources invested by the lobby through both instruments have a joint effect on the degrees of political selection, media capture, and incumbent discipline, which ultimately determine voter welfare. We employ our model to study (i) how special interest groups adjust their behavior to regulation and (ii) its consequences in terms of voter welfare and its components. We show that, depending on the particular instrument that is regulated, the instruments of influence might be strategic substitutes or complements. Moreover, our analysis reveals new trade-offs in regulating either campaign finance or the media. Imposing a stronger regulation of campaign finance induces both a superior selection and discipline at the cost of higher media capture, as the lobby substitutes campaign contributions by media influence. On the other hand, imposing a stronger regulation of the media leads to a lower media capture and superior selection at the cost of a worse incumbent discipline, as the higher probability of exposure through the media makes a dissonant incumbent less controllable by voters. Finally, we analyze the relevant example of campaign spending caps and black cash in elections as an application, and we discuss simple conditions under which a tighter campaign spending cap induces an improvement in voter welfare."}}

However, how effective were these policies in easing financial conditions and reducing the risk premia of European non-financial firms (NFCs)? This paper examines the effect of the ECB's policies on NFCs' credit default swaps (CDSs). We collected daily CDS prices of publicly traded European NFCs to analyze the immediate short-term effects of the policy announcements between June 2nd, 2014, and December 30th, 2016. We also test the possible impact of the various policies on NFCs' CDS prices using monthly data from January 2008 to February 2018. Our primary findings are fourfold: First, the ECB's asset purchase programme announcements seem to affect CDSs on the day of the announcements and in the subsequent days. Second, these announcements had a stronger effect on CDS prices after the main public sector asset purchase programmes (PSPP) started in March 2015. Third, between 2008 and 2012 and between 2015 and 2018, after controlling for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, the ECB's interest rate policy had statistically and economically significant effects in reducing monthly CDS prices. Fourth, some of the ECB's asset purchase programmes, such as the PSPP, had a statistically significant effect on monthly prices. These findings indicate that some of the ECB's policies have significantly cut firms' risk premiums since 2015 as market conditions improved."}}

The framework analysed the energy transition in Asia and Africa and identified points of convergence and divergence between the two regions. The study concluded that while both regions varied in energy endowments, priorities, and national conditions, they have similar goals to improve energy access and mitigate climate change. Apart from investing in clean energy projects, Asian economies are playing more participatory roles in the energy transition via investments in R&amp;D, development of clean energy technologies and carving niches in energy-saving and low carbon technologies to generate export revenues. While African economies are overly reliant on debt-financing, Asian economies are actively generating internal financing sources to promote the energy transition. The study proposed several recommendations useful for researchers, policy makers and governments to explore more critically to accelerate the energy transition in Asia and Africa."}}

Under the structure of environmental federalism in the United States, California has implemented its own environmental legislation that is stricter and more innovative than federal standards, and has established a lifecycle-based regulatory framework that addresses plastic reduction across the stages of production, consumption, and disposal. This study compares, at the micro-level, the policy tools adopted by Korea and California at each lifecycle stage, and further analyzes their legal systems at the macro-level by comparing their legal structures and regulatory paradigms, their implementation and enforcement governance, and their approaches to international norms and just transition. This analysis reveals a key distinction: while South Korea's legal system emphasizes efficient waste management based on the post-hoc correction of market failures, California adopts a proactive strategy aimed at a fundamental transformation by restructuring the market itself. This approach represents a paradigm shift in the plastic lifecycle, integrating production reduction, expanded use of recycled materials, and a just transition. Based on these findings, this study proposes key legislative tasks to be incorporated into South Korea's new roadmap to proactively respond to the upcoming international plastics treaty. These tasks include establishing production reduction targets, enhancing the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system, mandating the use of recycled materials, and the legal codification of the principle of actual recycling."}}

The authors explore these facets through a case study of uncertainty, that of unexpected monsoon floods in 2018 and 2019 in Wayanad, a peri-urban hill district in Kerala, India. Through the case, they show that compounded uncertainty leads to ambiguity in action, but that this ambiguity can be ameliorated by a contextualised contingency planning approach. The authors conclude the article by outlining the approach in spatial planning that prioritises flexible and adaptable decision-making to enhance iterative organisational learning and action, as well as cross-sectoral dialogue to deal with uncertainty."}}

The recent literature has in fact questioned the threshold of transparency and purpose limitation ensured by individual rights regimes in curbing the impact of such surveillance on employees' rights.

Reasoning from the available literature, legislation and case law, this paper shows how the GDPR can be receptive to the purposes of labour regulation through a systematic application of impact assessments and social consultation. The legality and legitimacy of data processing at work ought to be shaped through collective bargaining and impact assessments, thus preventing the sphere of labour protection from being channelled only through the individual rights of the data subject.

Further, our evidence implies that the debt pricing impact of SEC investigations is amplified for borrowers suffering worse credit quality and information asymmetry as well as those relying more on bank loans. These findings suggest that banks perceive increased risk for borrowers under SEC scrutiny while also leveraging their knowledge of the investigations to extract rents. Supplementary analyses reveal tighter non-spread loan terms and a higher likelihood of amending existing loan contracts during SEC investigations. Additionally, the tightening of loan terms reverses for investigations that conclude without enforcement actions. Overall, our research identifies an economic cost of SEC investigations and alerts regulators to these costs when deciding whether to launch an investigation."}}

As a result, income inequality is countercyclical. Since bank credit supply has been shown to play an important role over the business cycle, this paper asks: Do shifts in the supply of bank credit contribute to the observed cyclical fluctuations in income inequality? Using an estimated bank credit supply shock based on Bassett et al. (2014), I find that, first, a tightening of bank lending standards leads to a rise in income inequality due to a larger decrease in income at the bottom of the distribution relative to the middle and top. Second, compared to total factor income (TFI), labor income at the bottom of the distribution contracts more following the tightening of bank lending standards. As a result, labor income inequality rises by more than TFI inequality. Third, bank credit supply shocks account for a nontrivial amount of the cyclical variation of income inequality. Depending on the specification and inequality measure, bank credit supply shocks can account for up to 42% and 33% of the volatility of labor income inequality and TFI inequality, respectively. To rationalize these observations, I build a tractable heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (THANK) model with an income-skill complementarity among households: i.e., 'poor' hand-to-mouth households supply unskilled labor, while 'rich' unconstrained households supply skilled labor. Firms require a bank loan to pay their labor wage bills in advance of production. When the representative bank reduces its supply of credit to firms, the cost of borrowing rises, leading to a fall in labor demand of both skilled and unskilled workers. However, since it is costly for firms to adjust their skilled labor, firms optimally choose to cut their unskilled workforce by more. The result is a rise of income inequality as 'poor' households lose a larger share of income relative to the 'rich' households."}}

Indeed, the sovereign debt burden of the Reich and the states combined increased from around 5 billion marks in 1914 to approximately 156 billion Marks in 1918 at the end of the war. Despite these staggering numbers, an understanding of war finance that merely focuses on the balance sheets of the treasury and the central bank cannot provide an accurate picture, as it misses out on the paramount role that off-balance-sheet fiscal agencies (OBFAs) played at the time. In this paper, we trace the activities of six types of OBFAs along three stages of the war finance operations from Summer 1914 to November 1918. First, the <i>Seehandlung </i>was Prussia‚Äôs state-bank that acted as market maker for sovereign debt, stimulated expansion and helped with funding throughout the war. Second, the <i>Darlehnskassen</i> (Loan Funds) were sub-balance sheets of the Reichsbank that supported expansion of the war economy by issuing <i>Darlehnskassenscheine </i>as a parallel currency and acted as market-maker for sovereign debt. Third, <i>Kriegskreditbanken </i>(War Credit Banks)<i> </i>were financial institutions that played an important role in the expansion phase of the first two months of war. Fourth, <i>Kriegsgesellschaften </i>(War Societies)<i> </i>were private sector institutions that became increasingly entangled with the state during the war and operated at an accelerated pace in the third stage as the war economy increasingly faced shortages. A similar dynamic was exhibited, fifth, by state-owned enterprises. Finally, industrial associations played an important role in the governance of the German war economy. To carve out the role of OBFAs in the war finance activities, we reconstruct the monetary architecture of the German war economy and translate the activities of the treasury, the Reichsbank, and key OBFAs into flow charts that analytically distinguish between initial expansion and long-term funding. By unpacking the role of OBFAs rather than the treasury‚ÄìReichsbank dyad commonly emphasised in financial historiography, we extend the Critical Macro‚ÄëFinance perspective into the realm of early‚Äëtwentieth‚Äëcentury war finance.</span></p>"}}

In this context, the role of dams is crucial. We consider the optimal control of a dam, where the water level must not exceed a designated safety threshold, nor fall below a minimum level to ensure functionality and sustainability for for the outgoing river. To model dry spells and intense rainfall events, commonly referred to as water bombs, we introduce a Hawkes process, a well-known example of a self-exciting process characterised by time-correlated intensity, which endogenously reproduces the concentration of events. The problem is formulated as an optimal switching problem with constraints. We establish existence results and propose numerical methods for approximating the solution. Finally, we illustrate the main achievements of this approach through numerical examples. The main and counterintuitive result of our numerical analysis is that the optimal water level inside the dam increases with the self-exciting parameter. This result shows that, when facing the dilemma of managing the opposing risks of dam overtopping and dry spells, the former ultimately dominates the latter. In conclusion, dams will increasingly lose their role as water reserves and take on a greater role in flood protection."}}

This study provides the first analysis of how import competition affects total factor productivity (TFP) of U.S. FV farms, using farm-level data from the Census of Agriculture for 2007, 2012, and 2017. Employing an instrumental variables strategy that leverages exogenous supply shocks to address endogeneity, we find that a 100-percentage-point increase in import competition raises FV farms' TFP by 1.1%. This productivity gain stems from the exit of less productive farms and TFP growth among surviving ones. Heterogeneous analysis indicates that larger farms experience a large TFP growth. We also find an inverse-U relationship between import competition and farm-level TFP growth, indicating that farms facing extreme competition experience TFP declines. Further analysis shows that import competition reduces FV farms' cropland acreage and intermediate input expenditure but does not affect capital expenditure, suggesting no increase in mechanization in response to import pressure."}}

Additionally, empirical insights from diverse contexts are necessary to gain a nuanced understanding of the ageing-in-place debate. To shed light on the global challenges of gender and ageing disparities, this chapter uses intersectionality as a theoretical lens to analyse current urban planning policies and practices. By examining case studies from both the Global North and Global South, it discusses how intersectionality can inform efforts to mainstream gender and ageing in urban planning. Furthermore, this chapter underscores the interdependencies between intersectionality and gender mainstreaming and how they can facilitate age- and gender-appropriate planning and design strategies. While promising initiatives to address ageing in place have emerged in some cities and countries, planning policies and city-building practices in many developmental contexts still perpetuate patriarchal social norms. Therefore, systemic consideration is needed to create holistic and inclusive urban environments. Ultimately, this chapter argues that applying an intersectional lens to gender mainstreaming in urban planning can prioritise the ethics of care and create age-friendly environments.</span>"}}

Assuming inflation‚Äôs responsiveness to its determinants varies across inflation regimes and that inflation shock magnitude shapes the dynamics, we endogenously identify distinct inflation regimes and analyze nonlinear behaviors within such regimes for the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and T√ºrkiye. In the first stage of our analysis, we employ a Hidden Markov Regime Switching Model combined with Monte Carlo simulations to establish high- and low-inflation thresholds. In the second stage, we utilize an ordered probit model to identify nonlinear probabilistic relationships between inflation regimes and key drivers of inflation such as unit labor costs, exchange rates, and global inflation. Our method achieves over 90% accuracy in predicting inflation regimes based on historical data. It also shows particularly strong out-of-sample performance in the post-pandemic period, outperforming the forecasts of international financial institutions. Even without prior knowledge of exogenous variables, the method anticipates regime shifts in five of the six countries analyzed for 2022 and 2023. Our approach offers researchers and central bankers a robust alternative analytical framework for managing high- and low-inflation environments where traditional linear or equilibrium-based models fall short."}}

Originating from military tactics and popularized in the marketing world by Levinson in 1984, guerrilla marketing emphasizes creativity and unconventional approaches over large budgets to reach consumers. While initially conceived in a pre-digital landscape, this research argues that the core principles of guerrilla marketing are not only still relevant but are amplified by the accessibility, low barriers to entry, and reach of digital technologies. The article provides a foundational understanding of guerrilla marketing, including its definition, historical context, basic concepts, and key rules. It then explores the arsenal of guerrilla tactics, categorizing them into minimedia, maximedia, and contemporary approaches like ambient, buzz, viral, and ambush marketing. A significant portion of the article is dedicated to analysing the application and effectiveness of guerrilla marketing in the digital era. It examines the role of social media platforms, the strategic use of memes, the power of generating online buzz, and the potential of generative artificial intelligence as tools for modern guerrilla marketers. Case studies, such as the unconventional Facebook strategy of a Polish funeral services company and Wendy's adept use of memes, illustrate the successful adaptation of guerrilla principles in the digital sphere. The article also addresses ethical concerns surrounding certain guerrilla marketing tactics, acknowledging the need for marketers to navigate legal and social norms carefully to avoid backlash. Ultimately, the findings suggest that guerrilla marketing is not only effective in the digital age but possesses an enhanced potential for impact due to the inherent virality and reach of online platforms. While the fundamental requirement for creativity and unconventional thinking remains paramount, digital technologies provide a fertile ground for guerrilla marketers to operate with agility, target specific audiences, and achieve significant brand awareness and engagement, often with limited financial resources. The article concludes that in an increasingly cluttered advertising environment, the core tenets of guerrilla marketing ‚Äì creativity, surprise, and impactful messaging ‚Äì are more critical than ever for brands seeking to stand out and connect with consumers."}}

Their work contradicts the dogma of model selection, including the Principles of Parsimony and Occam's Razor. They find that when the number of predictors far exceeds the number of observations, the bias-variance trade-off breaks down, the variance declines, and the Sharpe ratio increases. In the context of ridge regression, we find that very high complexity coupled with large penalty terms (excessive shrinkage) generate forecasts that converge to a rolling window of past returns. For example, we show the past twelve-month moving average of actual returns is 97.5% correlated to the forecasts from a twelve-month rolling window of random Fourier features with a large penalty. This finding is consistent with the theory of ridge regression. As the penalty term increases, the forecasts closely approximate the mean, and ignore the explanatory variables. Thus, increasing complexity does not outperform the standard ridge regression, and increasing complexity does not generate high Sharpe ratios, abnormal returns, utility gains or profitable investment strategies."}}

Existing forecasting approaches-relying on simple statistical models or rigid scenario matching-struggle with sparse and heterogeneous corporate disclosures, limiting their reliability and practical relevance. This paper introduces a novel, credibility-weighted forecasting framework that jointly integrates historical emissions data and forward-looking decarbonisation targets, assigning quantitative weights based on the credibility and source of each data point, to account for its reliability. By applying linear interpolation between sectoral and regional benchmark decarbonisation pathways (e.g., NGFS scenarios), the method generates continuous, scenario-aligned Implied Temperature Rise (ITR) metrics even in the presence of incomplete or inconsistent data. Empirical analysis of circa 1,400 listed companies across multiple sectors and geographies demonstrates that the approach improves forecasting accuracy, achieves stronger scenario alignment, and exposes areas of target over-or under-ambition that conventional models miss. These results offer clear guidance for investors and regulators seeking robust, scalable, and transparent tools to assess corporate Net-Zero alignment and inform climate-related portfolio decisions."}}

We develop a New-Monetarist model with endogenous costly fraud and screening, which jointly determine the presence of fraudulent assets as well as liquidity. Without money, fraud arises in equilibrium when the costs of fraud and screening are sufficiently low. This occurs as random screening acts to relax the asset resalability constraint that normally prevents fraud from occurring. Money can substitute for random screening as a device to relax the asset resalability constraint, and thus, fraud never arises when money is valued. The model highlights monetary policy implications for fraud incentives and asset liquidity."}}

Earlier studies, has shown strong evidence of the influence of attitude on the consumer' buying intention. In contrary, some studies further holds that along with attitude of the consumer the buying experience influenced by the perceived social norms plays an important role in persuading the buying intention of the consumer. However the earlier studies have not clearly stated the importance of social norms is justifying the relationship between the attitude and buying intention. The thrust of the current research is based on a pertinent question, is the relationship between attitudes of the consumer and buying intention towards eco-friendly products is mediated by perceived social norms? To explore such relationship, the researcher has adopted multistage sampling method and data was collected from 428 respondents. Further, Smart-PLS approach was adopted to do the data analysis. The outcome of the study revealed that both the attitude of the consumer and perceive social norms have positive influence on the buying intention of the consumer towards consumption of eco-friendly products. Moreover, the \"perceived social norms\" mediate the relationship between the \"attitude\" and \"buying intention\" of the consumer. The finding of the study strongly affirms the existence of partial mediation.

This paper reframes the evaluation of capitalism by arguing that its core strength lies in its capacity to generate innovations that systematically reduce the burdens of human limitation, namely physical effort, limited trust, and bounded cognition. Drawing on a typology of constraint-reducing innovation, I examine how capitalist institutions, through the mechanisms of profit and loss, channel entrepreneurial discovery toward solutions that expand the scope of voluntary cooperation. The analysis engages with the Theory of the Adjacent Possible (TAP) and argues that while TAP provides a compelling account of the expansion of innovation possibilities, it lacks a plausible selection mechanism. The contribution of this paper is to identify capitalist institutions as providing that missing selection function. The result is not random technological change, but a patterned directionality. Innovations that survive and scale are those that reduce the cost of coordination in large-scale societies. Contemporary cases including blockchain and artificial intelligence are examined as extensions of this logic. The broader conclusion is that capitalism should not be judged solely by its outcomes, but by its institutional capacity to solve coordination problems and reduce the burdens of being human."}}

While statistical physics and mass spectrometry demonstrate the correct application of statistical mathematics to natural phenomena, liberal arts disciplines have increasingly privileged data-driven research over theoretical reasoning, leading to a fundamental distortion of the academic research paradigm. This bias has created a scientific culture that systematically devalues low-probability but scientifically significant events and theoretical innovation in favor of statistically significant but potentially spurious correlations. The article argues that this trend represents a departure from the foundational principles of scientific inquiry, which should prioritize logical reasoning and theoretical understanding over mere data collection. The consequences extend beyond methodology to affect the very nature of academic discourse, where theoretical contributions are dismissed as \"opinion pieces\" while empirically-supported but theoretically shallow work is privileged. This misapplication of statistical thinking has created barriers to paradigm-shifting research and theoretical innovation across both humanities and natural sciences."}}

It also analyses the impact of a broad set of revenue recycling mechanisms on support ‚Äì covering more options than previous international studies. Based on a nationally representative survey conducted in Hungary in the summer of 2022, the results reveal low public acceptance of, and WTP values for, a carbon tax, and limited increases in both acceptance and WTP when revenue recycling is introduced. All values are lower than those typically observed in Western European surveys. A unique finding is the relative popularity of allocating carbon tax revenues to health care and education ‚Äì a preference not reported in earlier studies. The results underline the importance of thoroughly considering the distributional impacts of carbon pricing and of integrating strong social elements into climate policy design. Special attention should be paid to those who support carbon pricing only if revenues are recycled. To enhance public acceptability, this brief recommends (1) cutting taxes on energy alongside introducing carbon pricing with compensation for vulnerable groups, (2) legally earmarking carbon tax revenues for selected climate and social spending in underfunded areas, and (3) improving public understanding of climate change, the benefits of climate policy, and how carbon pricing works. The findings can inform Hungary‚Äôs Social Climate Plan, due by June 2025, which could unlock substantial EU funds to help mitigate the social impacts of carbon pricing.</span>"}}

It proposes a scalable framework combining the African Leadership University (ALU)'s multi-city model with the Community Services Association (CSA) Rwanda's district-based learning ecosystem. The study is guided by three research questions: RQ1: What systemic enablers support the diffusion of industry-linked university hubs in Africa? RQ2: What key barriers limit diffusion, and how do they vary across countries? RQ3: How can proven models (e.g., ALU, CSA) be adapted and costed for scale? (2)Methodology. A qualitative comparative analysis was conducted using 35 high-credibility secondary sources filtered via a PRISMA-adapted protocol from an initial 245 records (2010-2025). Four cases-ALU, CSA, Ashesi University, and UNICAF-were analyzed through the lenses of Diffusion of Innovation, Triple Helix, and Experiential Learning theory. Although the study relies exclusively on secondary sources, we applied light-touch text-mining in MAXQDA: policy documents were tokenised, stop-words removed, and coded with an unsupervised LDA algorithm (k = 6) to surface latent themes that triaged sources for qualitative comparative analysis; no clustering or association-rule modelling was undertaken. Visual tools-including causal-loop diagrams, scorecards, and a Gantt-style scale-up roadmapsupported synthesis. (3) Findings. Five core enablers emerged: policy alignment, institutional autonomy, Triple Helix linkages, diversified finance, and contextualized curricula. Barriers included regulatory rigidity, funding fragility, governance gaps, and digital divides. The proposed Pan-African Learning Hub Framework blends ALU's experiential pedagogy with CSA's grassroots model, enabling vertical progression from districtlevel cooperatives to regional research hubs. A three-year scale-up plan (USD 400-4,000 per student/year) suggests viability under flexible policy conditions. (4) Research Limitations / Implications. Secondary-data reliance constrains causal attribution and excludes francophone/North African contexts. Field validation and financial modeling are recommended for future work. (5) Practical Implications. Policymakers and institutions can use this framework to pilot scalable, employment-linked hubs without constructing new campuses. (6) Originality / Value. This is the first study to align Africa-wide policy ambitions with operational design and costing of university-linked hub models."}}

The first design replicates major stock exchange openings, allowing order placements and cancellations before announcing the opening price. We alternatively investigate two call auction designs in which traders are not allowed to cancel orders during the session, while the call auction time is divided into sub-periods and orders are executed every sub-period before the opening price is announced. We first demonstrate that allowing cancellations leads to price manipulation, while restricting them or introducing periodic clearings significantly reduces manipulative behavior. Second, we find a gradual price discovery process in economies with and prohibiting cancellations. However, price discovery can be quickly achieved in periodic clearings. These results indicate that price manipulations and longer non-trading minutes result in slower price discoveries. Third, we show that reinforcement learning, by which traders attempt to find profitable strategies from past performances, explains the order choices of our lab participants, and thus, price manipulations and price discovery. Lastly, we develop an equilibrium model of an opening call auction, which predicts uniform price discovery and trend-following strategies in all three designs, but experimental results reveal that real traders act more strategically and adaptively, improving price discovery and enabling manipulation absent in the model. We contribute to the literature by emphasizing the significant role of reinforcement learning on price manipulations and the price discovery process under different opening call auction designs. Our study has important policy implications regarding which call auction design is better for the opening call market."}}

Existing metrics such as API token costs, GPU-hour billing, or Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) fail to capture the complete lifecycle costs of AI systems and provide limited comparability across deployment models. This paper introduces the Levelized Cost of Artificial Intelligence (LCOAI), a standardized economic metric designed to quantify the total capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures per unit of productive AI output, normalized by valid inference volume. Analogous to established metrics like LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) and LCOH (levelized cost of hydrogen) in the energy sector, LCOAI offers a rigorous, transparent framework to evaluate and compare the cost-efficiency of vendor API deployments versus self-hosted, fine-tuned models. We define the LCOAI methodology in detail and apply it to three representative scenarios, OpenAI GPT-4.1 API, Anthropic Claude Haiku API, and a self-hosted LLaMA-2-13B deployment demonstrating how LCOAI captures critical trade-offs in scalability, investment planning, and cost optimization. Extensive sensitivity analyses further explore the impact of inference volume, CAPEX, and OPEX variability on lifecycle economics. The results illustrate the practical utility of LCOAI in procurement, infrastructure planning, and automation strategy, and establish it as a foundational benchmark for AI economic analysis.

By synthesizing historical timelines, sector-specific alignments, economic quantifications, and recent 2025 data from sources like the OECD and USTR, we demonstrate how counterfeiting generated spillover benefits-including enhanced production volume, reverse engineering expertise, and iterative innovation-that accelerated China's industrial capabilities by an estimated 5-15 years in key sectors like electronics, batteries, apparel and footwear, pharmaceuticals, auto parts, and toys. Detailed case studies illustrate these dynamics, showing how illicit practices in each sector created hidden value ($50-200 billion per sector) through \"learning by doing\" and technology absorption, enabling transitions to legitimate dominance. Traditional valuations 2 of IP theft, which focus on direct revenue losses (e.g., $225-600 billion annually for the U.S.), grossly undervalue the harm by overlooking these spillovers, which amplify competitive advantages for the thief while imposing long-term economic displacements on victims, such as 2-5 million job losses in U.S. IP-intensive industries. Incorporating these effects could inflate global cost estimates by 2-3 times, reaching $1-3 trillion annually. The analysis draws implications for U.S. trade policy, suggesting escalated countermeasures like tariffs, reshoring incentives, and multilateral pressures to reclaim portions of the amplified losses. This study contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive framework for assessing IP theft's dynamic impacts, with case studies offering granular evidence for policymakers."}}

We discuss three broad reasons why the status quo is in fact sub-optimal: agency problems in private equity which are comparable to those in public equity markets; poor outcomes including those resulting from \"bankruptcy hardball\"; and the free-riding advantage conferred on public markets. To address this we propose a modest level of mandatory public disclosure in private equity markets.

A balanced panel of 42 firm-year observations for the seven largest publicly traded companies (2019-2024) is analysed, with return on assets (ROA) as the dependent variable and leverage, liquidity, operational efficiency, and firm size as explanatory factors. A Hausman specification test favors a cross-section random-effects estimator. The chosen model explains 66 % of the variation in ROA (weighted R-squared = 0.66; adjusted = 0.62) and reveals that higher operational efficiency significantly enhances profitability while greater leverage exerts a pronounced negative effect. Liquidity and firm size are positive but not statistically significant.

First, improving how existing assets are deployed through tighter cost control, shorter project cycles, or better inventory management which offers a dependable route to higher returns. Second, monitoring capital structure is crucial: excessive borrowing can undermine performance even when market conditions appear favorable. In comparison, simply accumulating cash or pursuing scale for its own sake delivers no clear profitability benefit; growth and liquidity policies should therefore be guided by project-level economics rather than balance-sheet size alone.</span></p>"}}

The study examined six key themes: IPOB agitation, activities of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), attacks and assassinations by unknown gunmen, reprisal operations and abductions by government security forces, incidences of kidnapping, and attacks by killer herdsmen. A qualitative descriptive research design was adopted, utilizing thematic content analysis to examine data sourced from scholarly journals, media reports, government policy documents, NGO publications, and international development records.

Findings revealed that insecurity has disrupted economic activity, weakened investor confidence, and constrained mobility and productivity across the SouthEast. While most forms of insecurity were found to negatively impact development, the activities of ESN appeared to offer localized protection in some areas. The study concludes that insecurity-if left unaddressed-will continue to hinder socioeconomic resilience in the region.

In a shallow learning setting, we compare two regression approaches: the first directly learns the hedging strategy from the expected signature of the price process; the second models the dynamics of volatility using a signature volatility model, calibrated on the expected signature of the volatility. Solving the hedging problem in the calibrated signature volatility model yields more accurate and stable results across different payoffs and volatility dynamics."}}

The system allows users to define granular, field-wise matching strategies through external configuration, including the selection of various fuzzy string comparison algorithms, individual field weighting, and custom preprocessing logic for specific data types. It provides detailed match outputs, including overall similarity scores, Soundex comparisons, and per-field comparison details, facilitating transparency and iterative refinement of matching rules. We discuss the architecture, core matching engine, API design, and performance optimization strategies such as dynamic blocking for cross-recordset comparisons.

Due to its informality and decentralised nature, the boundaries of this community (i.e., who is in and out) are not always clear, but various social aspects highlight its existence. From common jargons and regular gatherings to leading voices that serve as reference in the field, its existence is as true a social reality as other epistemic groups.

This note describes this community, identifies its members, and explains how it relates to the broader economic and political system in which it is inserted. The conclusion is that the community has been in therapy, as a result of its role as both catalyser and subject of macropolitical debates, despite the technical nature of the field."}}

The writings of William Shakespeare -- an acclaimed observer of humanity -- provide a classic data set of human behavior that can be tested for its adherence to prospect theory. This paper explores Shakespeare's works, finding that the main elements of prospect theory-reference point dependence, loss aversion, and asymmetric gain/loss risk preferences are well represented within the Shakespeare canon. A second branch of behavioral economics, that examining happiness or \"subjective wellbeing,\" also is reviewed in light of Shakespeare's works.

Political discretization-the systematic fragmentation of continuous democratic processes into controllable categorical units-represents a measurable pattern of institutional capture that operates across multiple domains from early Christian authority conflicts to contemporary regulatory capture and digital platform manipulation. Building on Max Weber's authority typology and contemporary neuroscientific research demonstrating how partisan identity suppresses analytical thinking, this framework provides empirical tools for measuring discourse fragmentation, authority substitution, cognitive conditioning, and alternative suppression in real-time. Unlike subjective assessments of democratic backsliding, this methodology enables evidence-based early warning systems through systematic measurement of institutional capture mechanisms. The framework integrates established research methodologies from political communication analysis, neural pathway studies of political cognition, and historical patterns of epistemological colonization to create comprehensive assessment instruments. These tools measure: (1) media discourse quality through automated text analysis and complexity preservation indices; (2) congressional oversight effectiveness through constitutional adherence and institutional independence metrics; (3) regulatory capture resistance through authority substitution and transparency assessments; and (4) democratic input preservation through citizen influence and alternative perspective protection measures. For practitioners, this research provides immediately implementable measurement protocols for government oversight bodies, civil society organizations, and international democracy support agencies. The framework enables systematic monitoring of democratic institutional health, early detection of capture patterns, and evidence-based intervention strategies. For academics, it offers novel theoretical synthesis bridging classical political theory with contemporary empirical research while providing robust methodological tools for cross-national comparative analysis. The framework's validation through historical back-testing, cross-domain pattern recognition, and integration with established research methodologies positions it as a foundational tool for protecting constitutional governance in an era of systematic institutional pressure. Rather than relying on crisis response or partisan interpretation, democratic societies can now proactively monitor and protect their institutions through systematic measurement and evidence-based intervention."}}

We find that liquidity components have asymmetric effects, with thinly traded securities facing significantly higher execution costs, latency, and temporal fragmentation compared to actively traded stocks. Market fragmentation, exacerbates these inefficiencies for low-activity stocks, as liquidity becomes more fragmented and execution times increase. Furthermore, we show that competition among exchanges benefits high-activity stocks but has a detrimental impact on the execution quality of low-activity stocks, leading to larger quoted spreads and slower executions. Our findings suggest that liquidity disparities are not simply a function of trading volume but also reflect the impact of modern market dynamics."}}

The high-minus-low return spread ranges from ‚àí9.1% to ‚àí12.8% annually, controlling for standard risk factors. The effect is most pronounced among small-cap and growth firms, and in stocks with lower institutional ownership or belonging to disclosure-intensive industries. Our findings support the investor underreaction hypothesis, where information overload delays price adjustment, particularly where investor attention is limited. Robustness tests confirm that the effect is not subsumed by known factors. This study contributes to the asset pricing and disclosure literature by identifying a novel channel‚Äîdisclosure density as a priced friction in financial markets."}}

Leveraging transformer-based natural language processing, our model captures contextual and semantic nuances often missed by traditional text classification techniques, enabling more accurate detection of financial constraints. A key contribution is to differentiate between constraints that affect firms presently and those anticipated in the future. These two types of constraints are associated with distinctly different financial profiles: while firms expecting future constraints tend to accumulate cash preemptively, currently constrained firms exhibit reduced liquidity and higher leverage. We show that only firms anticipating financial constraints exhibit significant cash flow sensitivity of cash, whereas currently constrained and unconstrained firms do not. This calls for a narrower interpretation of this widely used cash-based constraints measure, as it may conflate distinct firm types-unconstrained and currently constrained-and fail to capture all financially constrained firms. Our findings underscore the critical role of constraint timing in shaping corporate financial behavior."}}

We contribute new insights with a randomized controlled trial in rural Senegal, providing information and basic assistance on the U.S. Diversity Visa Lottery, which offers medium-and high-skilled migrants access to permanent residence. The intervention significantly increases migration intentions and shifts preferences toward legal pathways. However, currently ineligible individuals, particularly those already contemplating irregular migration, show increased interest in migrating irregularly, suggesting an unintended consequence of efforts to broadly promote legal migration options.

Ensuring adequate competition is also the basic question when anti-trust authorities review mergers, such as the ‚Äú4-to-3‚Äù merger in 2020 between Spring and T-Mobile in the U.S. A concern is that too much concentration can lead to a small number of firms exerting market power to decrease social welfare. However, in telecommunication, increased concentration may also lead to efficiency gains due to various scale effects. For example, Hazlett and Crandall (2024a)  presents evidence that the Sprint/T-Mobile merger benefited consumers even though it led to fewer firms competing in the U.S. mobile market. This raises several basic questions. Does more concentration always benefit consumers and if not what effects determine the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù number of competing firms in a market? How does this depend on the market size, the amount of bandwidth available or the scale effects that are at play?<br><br>In this work, we present a game theoretic framework to give insights into these questions. Our model is based on a framework for Cournot competition with congestion effects that has been used in a number of papers to study competition in wireless markets and other setting where users are sensitive to congestion effects. In these models, wireless service providers compete by determining a quantity of customers to serve. The price that they can then charge each customer is determined by a market clearing price as well as a congestion cost that depends on their spectrum holdings and the network infrastructure that they have deployed. This captures the fact the spectrum is a congestible resource and that customers care about quality of service so that they are not willing to pay as much for a network that offers a poorer quality of service. Our model captures several different scale effects. We account for the investment incentives of a service provider as a function of their bandwidth holdings, where a provider with more spectrum may see a larger return from investing in infrastructure. We also consider a congestion model that can capture ‚Äúmultiplexing gains‚Äù achieved by serving more users with proportionally more bandwidth. Finally, we also consider how operational cost may scale with an increasing number of users. We use this model to compare the economic welfare obtained under with different number of competing firms and different distributions of bandwidth. Our results show that the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù number of firms can vary depending on these effects suggesting that policy makers need to carefully consider these effects when assessing competition."}}

Geographic mapping reveals that there are considerable gaps and a clear north-south digital divide in Mexico, with coastal states and tourist hubs often leading the nation. K-means clustering reveals that very high to high levels of internet access and use clusters are in northern Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur, and states bordering the U.S. The Federal District of Mexico including Ciudad de M√©xico (Mexico City), a hotspot of education and governance, has moderate level of internet access and use while the lowest levels are in central Mexico and southern states such as Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. Regression analysis reveals that ICT access is positively associated with proportion of literate population age 15 and over. Internet use is inversely associated with young dependency ratio, positively associated with proportion of population which has received telecommunications training, and in some cases, with GDP per capita. Overall, these findings reinforce demographic and socioeconomic dimensions of Mexico‚Äôs digital divide. Based on these findings, Mexico can develop effective telecommunications policies to ensure equitable technology access and use, specifically to those in underserved states and communities."}}

Then, we estimate how internet use interacts with distance from capital to affect political trust, adopting two instrumental variable strategies using 3G coverage and lightning strike frequency. We find that internet use reduces the distance trust relationship by cutting information costs. Remote citizens become more critical, aligning with opinions typically found near capitals. The effects are stronger in countries with high corruption and where governments capture traditional media. These changes translate into increased demand for political accountability and reduced electoral support for incumbents."}}

The purpose of this paper is to examine how financial accounting can be synchronized with these related systems in Japan, especially corporate laws, as the two have always been closely related. In this respect, we examined the experiences of other countries, particularly the U.S., the U.K. and France, since they are the most appropriate examples of how to deal with distributable profits reflecting international accounting standards like International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). We also discuss the effect of the possible change of treatment distributable profits under global accounting standards on behaviors of managements. Considering the financial environment, the Japanese government will need to emulate the European countries, seeking insights into the depth and breadth of the issues of the globalization of accounting standards and accounting principles of corporate laws. Thus, the experiences of other countries will be good examples for Japan in the coming future."}}

We begin with a conceptual shift: rather than treating the Big Bang as the ultimate beginning, we propose a deeper ‚Äúinformational rupture‚Äù in a preexisting ‚Äúmeta-vacuum‚Äù state, giving rise to multiple potential branches or phases of reality. One of these branches manifests as our familiar Universe, yet others may remain hidden or manifest indirectly via phenomena attributed to dark matter, dark energy, or quantum nonlocality. In Part One, we develop the axiomatic and mathematical foundations of this informational approach. We introduce a parametric space ŒõŒõ, an ‚Äúoperator control room‚Äù of informational states, and define how branches can emerge from phase transitions in the meta-vacuum. The standard physical laws‚Äîspace, time, fields, forces‚Äîare shown to be effective consequences of deeper informational processes. We also discuss how this viewpoint resonates with key ideas in quantum gravity, the holographic principle, and string theory. In Part Two, we explore how informational complexity evolves to generate higher levels of structure‚Äîleading from elementary particles and atoms to stars, galaxies, and biological life. Here, we propose that chemical, biological, and cognitive laws also arise as ‚Äúlayered‚Äù manifestations of the same informational foundation. Life and consciousness become natural outgrowths of informational dynamics, with each level introducing new effective principles that build upon (but do not contradict) underlying quantum and astrophysical laws. This model unifies multiple perspectives from quantum mechanics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and cognitive science under a single principle of informational primacy. It suggests that physical laws, the emergence of life, the development of consciousness, and cultural evolution can be viewed as stages of continually increasing informational organization. Finally, we outline possible future directions, including toy-model simulations, connections to modern theories of quantum gravity, and interdisciplinary research bridging physics, information science, biology, and philosophy.</span>"}}

While the transactional advantages of speed and cost reduction are well established, the broader economic consequences of real-time settlement remain underexplored. Focusing on high-value transactions such as B2B payments, this study investigates how accelerated settlement may affect liquidity, productivity, financial stability, inflation, fiscal enforcement, and fraud exposure. Drawing on international case studies, economic theory, and original quantitative estimates, the analysis finds that settlement delays currently immobilize up to $3.4 trillion in working capital. This generates an estimated opportunity cost of $171 billion per day, borne primarily by businesses in the form of short-term financing costs to bridge payment lags. Additionally, the paper estimates that long-term displacement of card-based payments by lower-cost instant payment methods may affect inflation dynamics and reduce consumer prices by 0.11 to 0.56 percentage points, depending on instant payment adoption and market structure. While these projections highlight material economic effects, they warrant further empirical validation. The analysis also underscores the importance of mitigating emerging risks such as financial fraud. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for U.S. regulators, emphasizing the need for interoperability, institutional mandates, and infrastructure investment to unlock the full economic benefits of instant payments."}}

The existing literature is deeply divided, with some studies finding that voters punish incumbents for disaster-related damages, while others find they reward them for relief efforts. This paper investigates the electoral consequences of natural disasters for incumbent mayors, broader electoral dynamics, and the long-term political ambition of officeholders. The study leverages a comprehensive panel dataset of over 10,000 candidate-election observations in U.S. mayoral races from 1989 to 2021, combining detailed election data with a global registry of disaster events. To identify causal effects, the analysis employs a robust dynamic two-way fixed-effects event-study design, validated by extensive pre-trend and placebo tests. The findings reveal that the electoral impact of disasters is highly conditional on their timing. A disaster that strikes in the same quarter as an election provides a significant electoral boost to incumbents, increasing their vote share by over 6 percentage points. However, disasters consistently suppress voter turnout, reducing it by an average of 1.4 percentage points. In a novel finding, the analysis demonstrates that the experience of managing a disaster significantly increases an incumbent's likelihood of seeking re-election in the subsequent cycle by as much as 12 percentage points. These findings help reconcile conflicting theories of retrospective voting by highlighting the critical role of voter myopia and salience. They also reveal a previously undocumented channel through which crises shape political careers, suggesting that disaster management is not only a test of governance but also a catalyst for political ambition.</span></p>"}}

Drawing on cultural memory studies, media theory, and recent examples from social media, the paper argues that nostalgia is neither inherently conservative nor progressive, but rather functions as a contested space where multiple identities and political agendas converge. In the Indian context, digital nostalgia surfaces in diverse forms: from romanticised portrayals of ancient empires to grassroots rediscoveries of neglected regional figures and communities. While such narratives can foster cultural pride and inclusivity, they can equally fuel exclusionary identity politics and historical grievance. The study shows how algorithmic amplification and emotionally charged content simplify complex histories into shareable, polarised stories, contributing to both empowerment and division. Ultimately, the paper suggests that nostalgia, when critically engaged, can serve not only as a bridge to the past but also as a tool for a more reflective national conversation about belonging, history, and identity."}}

The spillover effect, defined as the total value added of the new plant and its suppliers compared to the value added of the new plant alone, and simulated here under the strong assumption that the supply chain of the new plant is similar to those of existing firms, would be around 2.0 in manufacturing industry and 1.6 in market services.

Building on the predictions of this theoretical model, we estimate the impact of these different regulatory requirements on lending growth, on a panel of 54 French banks since 2014. Our results indicate that four pairwise interactions, most of them involving the leverage ratio, have a significant effect on lending growth. We also emphasize that the regulatory ratios interact more for banks with lower regulatory ratios and in periods of financial stress. More specifically, our results highlight a significant relationship of partial substitutability between the leverage ratio, the LCR and the NSFR for such banks in such periods, resulting from the positive effect of bank own funds on liquidity."}}

By applying entropy measures and variance decomposition, we analyze four emerging quantum domains-quantum optics, metrology, imaging, and sensing-to quantify the diversity and stability of their research trajectories. Our findings reveal that quantum optics exhibits lower variability and more stable developmental paths (entropy H = 0.83), while quantum sensing demonstrates higher variability and uncertainty (H = 0.93), indicating divergent evolutionary patterns. Variance analysis shows that 91.7% of the observed variability occurs within fields rather than between them, underscoring internal topic diversity as a critical driver of scientific and technological evolution. This suggests that variability is not merely noise but a structural feature that shapes the direction and pace of innovation. These insights have significant implications for technological forecasting. Fields characterized by high variability may signal earlystage, exploratory dynamics with multiple competing paradigms, requiring flexible and adaptive forecasting models. Conversely, low-variability fields may reflect more mature trajectories, where trend extrapolation and exploitation strategies can be more reliable. From a strategic perspective, our results suggest that innovation strategies should be aligned with the variability profile of the target field: exploratory approaches are better suited for high-entropy domains, while exploitative strategies can effectively support incremental innovation in low-entropy areas. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of scientific evolution and provides actionable guidance for R&amp;D managers, foresight analysts, and policymakers seeking to allocate resources, design innovation portfolios, and anticipate technological shifts in emerging quantum technologies."}}

The phrase aptly characterizes the quarter-century, multistage evolution of personal bankruptcy in Malaysia. That process culminated in late 2023 with reforms that mirror those in neighboring Singapore and many other more distant countries. Malaysian bankruptcy law has long included a very limited debt discharge, but as it left more and more economically debilitated debtors in perpetual bankruptcy limbo, policymakers became dissatisfied with leaving a huge and growing mass of debtors to languish. In 1998, they began taking a series of hesitant steps to alleviate the flow of cases into and, more importantly, accelerate the exit of cases out of the bankruptcy system. Eighteen months of empirical data on the effects of this revolution in Malaysian bankruptcy policy now reveal the important but limited effects of this process of entry and exit recalibration. The halting series of legislative and regulatory changes and consequent empirical results in Malaysia from 1999 to 2025 are enlightening as to the purpose and (in)effectiveness of various ‚Äúsafe‚Äù approaches to reducing the incidence of personal bankruptcy and expanding discharge relief. This article reveals those lessons. It also reveals the motivations for these monumental shifts in Malaysian bankruptcy policy, with a closer look at the nuanced role of Islamic law and individual religious conviction in a modern democratic majority-Muslim state.</span></p>"}}

The literature review identifies several critical factors that influence consumer spending patterns during inflationary periods, such as increased price sensitivity, shifts in brand loyalty, and the psychological effects of economic uncertainty. Research findings indicate that inflation significantly alters consumer decision-making, particularly impacting low-income households that face the brunt of price hikes on essential goods .The study reveals that consumers adopt a more strategic shopping approach, focusing on value and engaging in careful planning to counteract the adverse effects of inflation on their purchasing power. Furthermore, it highlights the role of purchasing power as a vital determinant of consumer spending, suggesting that government assistance and reliance on credit can help maintain spending levels even in the face of rising unemployment.Additionally, the paper underscores the necessity of incorporating psychological factors into economic analyses, as emotional reactions to inflation can lead to significant changes in spending, saving, and investment behaviors. By exploring these dynamics, the research aims to provide essential insights for policymakers and businesses striving to address the challenges posed by inflation and to formulate effective strategies that resonate with consumer concerns. Ultimately, this study enhances the understanding of how inflation influences consumer behavior and its broader implications for economic stability."}}

Through a comprehensive review of academic literature, regulatory reports, and empirical data, the study highlights how covenant-lite loans, declining underwriting standards, and increased cross-institutional exposures have created an opaque and potentially fragile credit ecosystem. The paper introduces a detailed scenario analysis simulating a severe monetary tightening shock, revealing potential contagion pathways from leveraged PE-backed companies to CLO tranches and institutional investors. Empirical data visualizations-including trends in global CLO issuance, the growth of covenant-lite loans, and the exponential rise in PE assets under management-reinforce the argument that these markets are more interconnected and systemically significant than widely recognized. The findings suggest that while CLO and PE markets have enabled broader capital formation, they also carry underappreciated risks that could transform localized credit shocks into global financial instability. The paper concludes by proposing policy and regulatory enhancements aimed at strengthening disclosure, improving stress testing frameworks, and reducing reliance on fragile capital structures."}}

As a recently introduced high-value crop, dragon fruit offers significant economic potential due to its adaptability, nutritional value, and strong market demand. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, primary data were collected from 160 dragon fruit farmers through structured household surveys. The Cobb-Douglas production function was employed to assess input-output relationships, revealing that labor, land preparation, seedlings, and fertilizer significantly influence income, with labor showing the highest elasticity (0.772). The estimated R-squared (0.898) suggests that the model explains a substantial portion of income variability. Cost-benefit analysis indicates a high benefitcost ratio (1.83), confirming strong profitability. Furthermore, dragon cultivation contributes to increased labor force participation and reduced dependency ratios. Average daily working hours rose by 2.13, and full-time employment increased by over 7 days per month, indicating a shift from seasonal to year-round employment. These findings highlight the socioeconomic benefits of dragon fruit cultivation and suggest that it is a viable tool for rural development. The study recommends supportive policies, input optimization, infrastructure investment, and market linkage to further enhance the profitability and sustainability of dragon fruit farming in Bangladesh."}}

While these resources can provide immediate solutions, they often come from unverified sources and lack the context necessary for correct application. This growing dependence on readily available, sometimes ill-advised, information can lead to significant missteps, including inefficient code, flawed methodologies, or incorrect conclusions. As a result, researchers may unwittingly propagate errors or overlook more robust, appropriate solutions that are crucial for scientific progress. This paper presents the integration of the Quantlet and Quantinar platforms, collectively referred to as the Q2 ecosystem, aimed at overcoming challenges faced by applied scientists and researchers due to the vast and fragmented array of data and code available online. The focus of this integration is to enhance accessibility and usability of academic resources by effectively linking research with pertinent code and datasets. The study introduces an adaptive clustering algorithm that organizes and dynamically groups academic content from Quantinar alongside code and computational results from Quantlet, thus linking academic theory and practice. With these technical advancements, the Q2 framework aspires to enhance transparency and reproducibility within the academic research landscape. Ultimately, it aims to provide a cohesive learning environment that meets the evolving needs of the academic community, empowering researchers in their pursuit of knowledge and facilitating deeper insights into complex data-driven methodologies."}}

Next, we document that merchant traders also thrive in periods of economic turbulence. Merchant traders make returns from building real options that pay off in volatile times, when short-horizon commodity price volatility is high, and when the many industries' supply and demand balances are out of equilibrium. In a panel regression, using commodity futures' price volatilities and a measure of aggregate supply demand imbalance in the economy, we can explain 41% of the time variation in nine of the leading merchant traders' annual profits. Finally, we present data from an executive survey related to perceived trading opportunities, that supports our other findings on the drivers of trading profits.

Using a matched difference-in-differences framework, pairing degree completers with non-completers from the same institution's metropolitan area, major, and enrollment cohort, we estimate the causal impact of credential completion on earnings net of student loan payments. We define loan-adjusted income as gross annual earnings minus observed student loan payments. On average, loan payments account for 23% of gross earnings premium in the years following completion, though this burden declines over time. Despite these costs, we find that postsecondary credentials yield substantial net earnings gains, reinforcing higher education as a worthwhile investment. We close with a discussion of implications for student loan and higher education policies."}}

The system operator makes real-time decisions regarding the amount of water to pump or release, thereby determining the amount of electricity to buy from or sell to the market. We model this problem as a Markov decision process, accounting for uncertainties in both streamflow rates and electricity prices. We prove the optimality of a state-dependent threshold policy under positive electricity prices: The state space can be partitioned into several disjoint domains, each associated with a different action type, such that it is optimal to bring the total amount of water in the facility and the amount of water in the upper reservoir to a different pair of state-dependent target levels in each domain. Incorporating this policy structure into a dynamic programming algorithm for data-calibrated instances (where prices can be negative) yields near-optimal solutions up to 28 times faster than brute-force optimization, with cash flow losses no more than 2% compared to the optimal solution."}}

Drawing on Liang (2021)&apos;s model of games with incomplete information played by statistical learners, we translate her abstract theoretical framework into a practical venture capital setting. We characterise how entrepreneurs balance funding plausibility against equity dilution by strategically choosing experiments along two critical dimensions: sample size (precision) and dimensionality (breadth of metrics). Our analysis reveals that for genuinely high-quality projects, increased precision helps by forcing VC beliefs to converge toward true quality. For low-quality projects, funding depends on preserving disagreement through sparse, high-dimensional experiments. The entrepreneur&apos;s optimal design depends critically on their prior beliefs: confident entrepreneurs choose high-precision, low-dimensional experiments that minimise equity dilution, while uncertain entrepreneurs opt for sparse, high-dimensional experiments that maximise the probability some VC will hold sufficiently optimistic beliefs. The framework provides a rigorous foundation for understanding how entrepreneurs and investors can rationally disagree when observing identical evidence, with significant implications for strategic information design in entrepreneurial settings.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34085\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

The narrative centers on Ramu, a security guard, and his wife Ranjana, who must decide the future of their twin children, Adan and Preethy. Armed with impressive but not-quite-elite exam scores, the twins stand at a crossroads. The path to a prestigious engineering degree is paved with a debt so large it threatens to swallow their family whole. The alternative, presented by a viral article on platform-based work, offers a quicker, seemingly safer route to financial stability through vocational skills like AC repair and cosmetology. This decision is laden with the weight of generations, pitting the dream of escaping a life of service against the immediate fear of hunger, and forcing the painful compromise of sacrificing one child's ambition for another's‚Äîa choice starkly divided along gender lines. However, this case study moves beyond a simple socioeconomic analysis. It serves as a crucible for some of the most profound and conflicting ideologies of the modern era. The family's personal struggle becomes a stage where the specters of Karl Marx, Ayn Rand, Franz Kafka, and Albert Camus, alongside the piercing contemporary voices of Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek and Naval Ravikant, debate the very nature of the predicament. Is this a textbook case of capitalist exploitation, a failure of individual rationality, an exercise in bureaucratic absurdity, or a drama of existential rebellion? Through this single, poignant family story, the case study forces us to confront fundamental questions of freedom, determinism, progress, and survival in the 21st century."}}

The alerts encourage load shifting and energy saving during specific hours on the following day. Using hourly load data for the utility, I estimate the reduction in electricity load caused by the alert emails. Using an instrumental variables approach, estimates suggest that load is reduced by roughly 0.7 MWs per hour during the hours covered by the alert. This works out to a reduction in load on the order of 2 percent. I calculate the cost savings to the municipal utility and discuss social and private benefits of the program.

Incremental co-inventors aspire to small gains at low costs and with less uncertainty. Novel co-inventors introduce new products or services with the potential for large returns, but do so at high costs and with uncertain outcomes. Similar firms investing in incremental co-invention will create value proportional to their existing business, a benchmark we illustrate with the experiences at local radio and newspapers. The study then examines the value of co-inventions for the World Wide Web and mobile ecosystems, focusing on success in 2013, using data from many sources. This data supports analysis comparing the incremental and novel regimes. The latter should display a distinctly different upper tail of the distribution of returns. We show that the value distributions for incremental and novel co-invention are far apart.  Incremental co-invention is more widely distributed across regions, industries, and firms. Success from novel co-invention is rare, challenging, and the source of the largest value. In the aggregate, novel co-invention creates the most value, so the overall value distribution remains concentrated in a few industries, regions, and firms.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34090\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Across eight GDP series, eight autocracy codings, and six measures of personalism, we observe a consistent pattern: Whenever an \"autocratic penalty\" emerges, it is concentrated in personalist regimes. The growth performance of institutionalized dictatorships, in contrast, is statistically indistinguishable from that of democracies. We document evidence that the \"personalist penalty\" is driven by some combination of low private investment, poor public-goods provision, and conflict. These findings emphasize the analytic payoff of unpacking autocracy and highlight the different incentives facing leaders with narrow and broad bases of power.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34093\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Often termed \"blank check companies,\" SPACs gained prominence in India with deals like Yatra Online's merger with a U.S.-based SPAC in 2016. However, their rapid growth has raised investor protection concerns due to past fraud cases, such as Nikola Corp. and Akazoo, which misled investors about business prospects. Regulatory bodies like the U.S. SEC and the UK's FCA have introduced stricter disclosure norms and safeguards, including mandatory escrow accounts and shareholder approvals, to mitigate risks. In India, SPACs face legal hurdles under the Companies Act, 2013, which mandates business commencement within a year, conflicting with SPACs' typical 1-2 year target acquisition timeline. SEBI's stringent IPO eligibility criteria, such as minimum tangible assets and profitability requirements, further complicate SPAC listings. Additionally, tax implications under the Income Tax Act, 1961, pose challenges for cross-border De-SPAC transactions. Despite these challenges, SPACs offer a faster route to public markets, prompting global regulators to refine frameworks balancing innovation and investor protection. For India to harness SPACs effectively, amendments in corporate, securities, and tax laws are essential, alongside enhanced transparency and investor education to prevent fraud and ensure sustainable growth in this evolving financial instrument."}}

By leveraging administrative data on prescribed medications and income tax records, we find that workers residing in heavily damaged areas were more likely to be prescribed medication for treating psychological disorders than those living in similar unaffected areas. Contrary to common belief, income effects played a limited role in mediating the impact of disaster damage on mental health. Instead, physical and emotional trauma due to direct exposure emerged as key mechanisms influencing mental health outcomes.

The reason for the gap may be the failure of moral suasion, the existence of a \"savior,\" an overestimate of risk, or an excessive reaction from auditors. Second, auditors became \"risk evasive\" after the amendment of the auditing standard in 2009, because of the amendment as well as the fact that the companies that finally went bankrupt without going concern disclosures had existed before revision Jan. 20, 2013."}}

Distinguishing these mechanisms matters for policy design, as income effects are non-distortionary while substitution effects generate deadweight loss. We isolate pure income effects for the UK's Personal Independence Payment (PIP) program, which supports disability-related costs without work restrictions or earnings tests. Using quasi-random regional assignment to different assessment providers and differential eligibility changes across health conditions following a 2013 reform, we estimate causal effects using a difference-in-differences design with matched panel data. Despite substantial benefit receipt changes (1.8-5.9 percentage points across strategies), we only find positive employment effects in stricter assessment regions. For individuals who gain or lose benefits due to condition-specific eligibility changes, the effects are close to zero. These findings suggest that disability benefits designed as cost-of-living supplements can provide financial security without necessarily disincentivizing work."}}

Natural resources are finite with limited scalability; consequently, resource-rich economies must eventually diversify, incurring an opportunity cost in the form of potential productivity losses when capital is reallocated from established extractive sectors. To quantify this opportunity cost, we apply a stochastic frontier framework to a panel of resource-dependent countries, allowing the marginal effect of natural resource rents on TFP to be recovered through the estimation of technical inefficiency. The results indicate that greater resource dependence generally raises TFP, but only in environments characterised by weak governance and high CO2 emissions. However, below a certain threshold level of dependence, improved institutional governance emerges as the principal driver of productivity. Two policy actions follow. First, consolidate and effectively regulate the extractive sector to capture the scale economies. Second, reallocate a portion of the resulting higher natural resource rents to more productive industries in which the country possesses a comparative advantage, including frontier industries. The successful implementation of these policy actions hinges on improved governance that boosts efficiency and transparency. In turn, economic diversification presents an opportunity for a green transition due to traditional extractive industries being compelled to modernise extraction with cleaner, more efficient capital in anticipation of a shift in labour toward emerging growth sectors."}}

Strategic KPIs are documented in the Annual workplan. Departments focus on measuring progress implementation of their activities and process timelines.¬† The results from the Departmental work plans feed into the Annual work plan which is used to assess fulfilment of strategic KPIs and ultimately MCAZ performance. Operational and functional KPIs are not clearly established. There is lack of adequate knowledge on KPI development and no comprehensive guidance documentation for establishing and implementing all types of KPIs.Conclusion While MCAZ demonstrates a well-defined approach to strategic KPIs management, significant gaps remain in KPI development and measurement processes. Overall corporate performance assessment for MCAZ is partially fulfilled as not all KPIs are taken into consideration."}}

This tariff escalation structure distorts trade by discouraging value-added exports from Canada, resulting in minimal processing activity in Canada for products destined for the Japanese market and allowing Japanese crushers to capture almost all downstream value-added. The analysis combines simulations using a multi-country partial equilibrium model (GSIM) with additional market structure considerations to estimate the order of magnitude of gains from tariff elimination. The study also highlights the need for negotiations to secure not only tariff reductions but also effective market access in Japan's vertically integrated downstream market."}}

The effectiveness of such systems hinges on the accuracy of ratings in capturing underlying ability. However, models like Elo typically rely on discrete, nonlinear updates from binary outcomes, which pose analytical challenges. To address this, the present study introduces a Gaussian framework in which match outcomes are treated as continuous noisy observations of relative skill. This setting enables explicit characterization of the evolution of rating-skill correlation and the conditions under which the rating distribution converges to a stationary state. The impact of key design parameters-such as update intensity and the degree of skill-based matching-on both convergence speed and long-run rating accuracy is examined. In settings where these parameters may vary over time, the trajectory that maximizes rating-skill correlation is derived and shown to coincide with the optimal estimator among a broad class of nonparametric update rules. The results provide a tractable and rigorous foundation for evaluating rating systems and offer guidance for designing effective learning mechanisms in dynamic competitive environments."}}

This paper proposes a technologically grounded and ethically structured alternative: the Standard Crypto Reserve (SCR), a decentralized, contribution-indexed, and lifespan-anchored reserve currency system. Drawing on institutional economics, modern monetary theory, and blockchain-based governance, SCR redefines reserve legitimacy not through GDP or capital holdings, but through verified human lifespan and measurable national contributions in education, innovation, governance, sustainability, and many such parameters. The proposed framework introduces a dual-vault architecture, comprising global and national reserves, with algorithmically regulated issuance based on a Contribution Index (CI). National currencies are valued proportionally to their SCR reserve and performance across socioeconomic indicators. The study contrasts SCR with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and commoditybacked systems, arguing for SCR's superiority in terms of structural transparency, ethical scarcity, and economic inclusivity (Catalini &amp; Gans, 2016; Yermack, 2013; Auer et al., 2020). Empirical support is proposed through dynamic general equilibrium modelling and comparative scenario simulations across pre-and post-crisis economies. By anchoring monetary value to verifiable life and contribution, SCR offers a globally interoperable and inflation-resilient standard, empowering emerging economies through performance-based inclusion and algorithmic trust. This paper advances the discourse on post-fiat reform and proposes SCR as a viable path toward equitable and resilient financial architecture."}}

But concerns about expansive use of character evidence soon became apparent: it tends to distort and confuse the issues in trial, and disproportionately benefits only high-status defendants.

Since low-income residents heavily rely on public transit and disproportionately live in neighborhoods where public transit buses traverse, removing air pollutants such as particulate matter from transit bus tailpipe emissions would achieve greater environmental justice. Although most major transit agencies had planned to complete bus electrification by 2040, many have fallen behind schedule. The inability of manufacturers to sufficiently improve electric bus technology and reduce unit costs, combined with transit agencies' hesitation to procure electric buses in significant quantities, has placed both stakeholders in a negative feedback loop, resulting in the stagnation of bus electrification in the United States. This paper describes several legal instruments available to transit agencies and proposes several legal interventions that transit agencies can implement immediately to enhance the outlook of the electric bus market and procure electric buses more cost-effectively, thus pushing transit agencies and manufacturers out of stagnation. This paper also identifies legal interventions federal agencies can implement to facilitate bus electrification in the United States. Interagency collaboration and federal coordination can increase the effectiveness of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Act in greening America's public transportation and revitalizing American manufacturing."}}

Millions of tenants face eviction without legal counsel each year, typically against landlords who are represented by an attorney. In response to calls from access to justice scholars and legal advocates, 25 jurisdictions have recently authorized right to counsel programs that provide legal assistance to tenants facing an eviction. While extant research has documented the many benefits of legal aid for housing-insecure tenants, less attention has been paid to the experiences of tenants who do not access legal counsel even when it is offered.</span></p>\n<p><span>This Article reports the findings of a mixed methods empirical study of the nation‚Äôs first statewide right to counsel program for tenants facing eviction. In doing so, we make three primary contributions. First, we draw on the theoretical framework of administrative burden in order to elucidate the barriers that evicted tenants face in their pursuit of legal aid. We analyze qualitative data from interviews with tenants who were initially unable to access legal assistance and show that eviction proceedings and the right to counsel program exact learning, compliance, and psychological costs on prospective participants. We further demonstrate that tenants frequently endure traumatic experiences that strain their cognitive resources and</span><span> </span><span>impede their efforts to contact</span><span> </span><span>legal aid providers.</span></p>\n<p><span>Second, we show that many tenants are still evicted without representation nearly three years after the implementation of Washington‚Äôs groundbreaking law. We analyze quantitative data from 970 unlawful detainer proceedings in Washington and identify predictors of tenants‚Äô legal representation. Although these data do not allow for precise measurement of administrative burdens, we provide empirical evidence of tenants‚Äô ability and willingness to engage with the legal process and the right to counsel program at multiple stages of the eviction process. Our analysis shows that two local rules intended to reduce default judgments against tenants are associated with lower default rates, but have not measurably increased tenant representation rates. We also find that tenants‚Äô submission of a written response to the eviction summons is a strong predictor of access to legal representation. Finally, we add to the body of evidence that shows improved case outcomes for represented tenants. Our findings suggest that interventions focused on marginally increasing compliance burdens for landlords do not meaningfully increase tenants‚Äô access to justice.</span></p>\n<p><span>We conclude by arguing that policymakers should apply user-centered design practices and lessons from research on the criminal legal system to increase tenants‚Äô participation in right to counsel programs. While right to counsel programs have dramatically improved rates of legal representation across jurisdictions, additional reforms are needed to ensure more comprehensive provision of legal aid. Right to counsel laws are a promising first step, but policymakers should further consider reforms that reduce the learning, compliance, and psychological costs of accessing legal aid by improving clarity of court communications, mitigating logistical complexity, and creating more flexibility for tenants who intend to participate in the legal process.</span></p>"}}

As past deregulatory episodes have shown, the current ‚Äúglobal deregulatory drive‚Äù to loosen financial regulation is likely to endanger global financial markets by encouraging excessive risk-taking by large banks and further expansion of ‚Äúshadow banking‚Äù activities by private equity funds, hedge funds, and other nonbank financial institutions.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n 2. Strong equity capital requirements, incorporated in robust leverage capital standards, are essential to maintain the stability of the banking system and to sustain lending by banks through the business cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n 3. Community banks play a vital role in the U.S. economy by providing credit to consumers, farmers, and small businesses, and by supporting the civic life of smaller and rural communities.&nbsp; However, community banks need greater support from Congress and regulators to maintain their viability.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n 4. Large universal banks, working in conjunction with nonbank financial intermediaries (‚Äúshadow banks‚Äù), have promoted a rapid and perilous expansion of private-sector and public-sector debts since 2009.&nbsp; Universal banks are supporting the growth of risky private credit obligations arranged by private equity firms as well as highly leveraged trading positions established by hedge funds in sovereign debt markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n 5. Private equity funds face severe challenges and are exposing bank lenders and captive insurance companies to increasing risks.&nbsp; Private equity funds and private credit funds are currently seeking to sell highly leveraged and illiquid investments to retail investors as well as pension funds and investment funds that serve retail investors.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n 6. The enormous costs of rescuing universal banks, shadow banks, and financial markets since 2007 have imposed huge fiscal burdens on governments and left central banks with bloated balance sheets.&nbsp; It is very doubtful whether governments and central banks could arrange another series of large bailouts in response to a future crisis without precipitating severe and destabilizing sovereign debt crises.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n 7. My written testimony recommends the following reforms:\n</div>\n<div>\n (a) Prohibiting nonbank financial institutions from offering ‚Äúshadow deposits,‚Äù which are short-term, deposit-like financial claims that compete with bank deposits and are highly vulnerable to investor runs.\n</div>\n<div>\n (b) Requiring large universal banks to hold significantly higher levels of equity capital to satisfy enhanced leverage capital requirements, and to undergo more rigorous stress tests to assess the viability and resilience of their business models,\n</div>\n<div>\n (c) Supporting the formation of new community banks and reducing compliance burdens for those banks if they provide substantial amounts of relationship loans to small and medium-sized enterprises\n</div>\n<div>\n (d) Implementing the Financial Stability Board‚Äôs recommendations for (i) enhanced reporting and disclosure requirements for hedge funds, private equity funds, and private credit funds; (ii) mandates requiring central clearing of government securities, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and other systemically important financial instruments; (iii) strong capital requirements for clearing facilities and robust margin requirements for their customers; and (iv) increased margin requirements, position limits, and concentration limits for significant financial instruments that are not centrally cleared.\n</div>\n<div>\n (e) Adopting stronger reporting obligations, capital requirements, asset quality and diversification standards, and oversight procedures for life insurance and reinsurance companies that are controlled by private equity firms.\n</div>\n<div>\n <div>\n  (f) Prohibiting ‚Äì or establishing very strong presumptions against -<span>&nbsp;</span>offerings of private equity funds and private credit funds to retail investors or to investment funds and pension funds that serve retail investors.\n </div>\n <div>\n  (g) Restructuring financial institutions and financial markets by separating banks from securities broker-dealers and other firms engaged in capital markets activities, in accordance with principles derived from the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933\n </div>\n</div>"}}

This pattern has particularly adverse effects where forest regrowth is slow, contributing to local forest loss and global environmental challenges such as climate change and biodiversity decline. This paper presents findings from a framed field experiment that examines how different types of monetary incentives affect forest-clearing decisions in northern Namibia, a semi-arid region with negligible forest regrowth. We implemented a common-pool resource game with 518 smallholder farmers across 25 villages, in which a forest stock declines dynamically based on participants' clearing decisions, without immediate regrowth. The game spans three periods: a baseline without incentives, an intervention period with individual or collective rewards or an individual fee, and a post-incentive phase. This setup allows us to assess both the immediate effects of incentives and their persistence after incentive removal. All incentive types reduce clearing compared to baseline, but not significantly more than in the control condition, where clearing also declined-an unexpected trend likely linked to features of the dynamic game design. Incentive effects largely dissipate after removal, with no strong evidence of lasting motivational crowding-in or crowding-out. Overall, our results suggest that moderate payments may be insufficient to sustain cooperation in persistent resource dilemmas. More broadly, they highlight the importance of multifaceted analyses including control conditions and careful experimental framing in field-laboratory studies, coupled with caution in generalizing findings to other settings or policy applications."}}

Using nationally representative data from over 18,000 students and nearly 1,000 elementary schools, we examine how the schools serving students from different neighborhoods vary across more than 160 characteristics, including detailed measures of their composition, resources, instruction, climate, and effectiveness. Our findings document significant differences in demographic composition between schools serving high-and low-poverty neighborhoods, but comparatively little variation in other dimensions of the school environment. With novel machine learning methods tailored for high-dimensional data, we estimate that equalizing all these different factors would reduce the achievement gap by less than 10%, primarily through changes in school composition. These results suggest that the primary drivers of place-based disparities in achievement lie outside of elementary schools, underscoring the need to address broader structural inequalities as part of any effort to reduce achievement gaps."}}

Applying a Stochastic Directional Distance Function, we estimate each plant's distance to the production frontier and compute the shadow price of CO 2 e emissions. Our results reveal a robust negative correlation between inefficiency and marginal abatement cost: technically efficient electric arc furnace (EAF) mini-mills-particularly prevalent in North America-display low inefficiency scores (‚àº0.2) and face high marginal abatement costs (up to 13.4 USD/ton). Conversely, integrated plants in developing countries often operate inefficiently (scores up to ‚àº0.8) but can abate emissions at very low cost (‚àº0.4 USD/ton), with Europe positioned between these two extremes. Estimated shadow prices are consistently lower than prevailing carbon market rates, highlighting a systemic under-valuation of emissions in the absence of regulatory pressure. This underpricing, in turn, reflects the highly uneven technological and economic conditions across steel plants worldwide, reinforcing the need for climate policies that account for both efficiency levels and plant configurations, and that tailor interventions to the specific costs and capacities of decarbonization."}}

Besides, managerial research has explored the nature, antecedents, consequences, dynamic features, and dimensions of innovation capabilities, yet lacks analysis at the micro-foundation level, particularly on the constituent elements of capabilities. To address this gap, this paper aimed to analyze startups' innovation capabilities, identifying the main elements present in four capabilities-two technological and two non-technological-that support the proposition of a theoretical framework. A systematic review of 94 papers was conducted using the content analysis technique. The main elements and sub-elements that are part of the innovation context in startups and interconnected to both technological and non-technological capabilities were identified. We also discovered that although some elements are present in a single capability, other elements are shared with more than one capability, a phenomenon we named element transversality. The findings allowed us to identify and integrate internal and external elements of capabilities that significantly enhance startups' overall performance. This study proposes a framework that captures the complex overlaps between technological and non-technological capabilities by advancing the theorizing process regarding startup innovation capabilities. The framework also considers that innovation capabilities can boost four types of startup performance: innovation, financial, operational, and market performance, which together form the overall performance. This framework can serve as a driver for resource investment (e.g., capital and time) by startups to build or mature their innovation capabilities and achieve superior performance toward business consolidation."}}

Adopting the concept of factor substitution, we model the production function as a set of discrete, substitutable options to explore the properties and interactions of these three perspectives. The findings demonstrate that each perspective yields a non-empty subset of solution options. Climate neutrality solutions are situated between neoclassical and net-zero solutions, exhibit discrete convexity, and are influenced by the level of GHG credit costs. Lower GHG credit costs tend to favour neoclassical solutions, while higher costs shift preference toward netzero solutions. This highlights the importance of GHG credit pricing in guiding the transition to a low-emissions economy. Moreover, the framework enables the categorization of new climate mitigation options based on their effects, whether they are irrelevant, complementary, or disruptive. Overall, the proposed model provides an alternative formal approach that enhances the economic analysis of climate change mitigation strategies."}}

Principle-based accounting is based on the philosophy of aiming for the ideal form of financial reporting without being bound by detailed rules in the relationship between auditors and companies preparing financial reports. However, in the actual application of these principles-that is, when preparing financial statements in accordance with the standards and conducting audits of such statements-auditors or companies must adopt different approaches compared to traditional practices (Nobes, 2005; Benston, Bromwich, and Wagenhofer, 2006a, 2006b, etc.). This paper examines specific accounting events that give rise to judgmental variability in audit judgments, focusing on revenue recognition for software, which requires complex judgments such as estimates, and discusses the relationship between the various types of audit judgment criteria and the actual responses of auditors. We demonstrate, with concrete examples, that regardless of whether the applicable audit standards follow a rule-based or principle-based approach, auditors form a basis for judgment-often referred to as \"Auditor GAAP\"-to fill gaps in the standards. This role becomes particularly significant when transitioning to a principle-based approach."}}

It was shown in Che and Spier (2008) that failure to internalize this externality can often be exploited by the defendant. However, if plaintiffs make sequential take-it-or-leave-it settlement offers, we can show that they will actually be exploited by one of their fellow plaintiffs rather than by the defendant. When we relax the assumptions, allowing each party to have positive bargaining power, the result lies between the two cases, and the plaintiffs can be exploited jointly by a fellow plaintiff and the defendant.Moreover, if litigation is a public good as is the case in shareholder derivative suits, parties may fail to reach a settlement even having complete information. This may explain why we observe derivative suits in the US but not in Europe."}}

Drawing on attribution theory, this study employs a between-subjects experimental design to test whether clients assign responsibility for errors differently based on a firm‚Äôs marketing emphasis on generative AI versus traditional services. Participants read a scenario in which a firm-prepared tax return contained errors. In one condition, the accounting firm‚Äôs marketing highlighted its use of generative AI tools; in the other, it emphasized a focus on traditional services. The source of the error was left ambiguous. Participants exposed to AI-promoting messaging attributed more blame for the errors to the firm, perceived it as having greater control over error prevention, and judged the errors as more likely to recur. These findings suggest that promoting generative AI in firm marketing may raise client expectations about control and reliability, increasing reputational risk even when the technology‚Äôs role in an error is unclear. The study contributes to research on attribution in professional services and highlights a potential tradeoff: firms that emphasize technological sophistication may also be seen as more culpable when things go wrong.</span></p>"}}

Laws made by algorithms can adjust in real-time to changing circumstances and vary for each individual based on personal characteristics. Making the law dynamic can increase its effectiveness. However, the personalization component of previous conceptions of algorithmic law is problematic. Algorithmic law, as conceived by other scholars, is made only using individual characteristics and fails to account for the interactive effects of individual behavior. The roles of spatial effects, social norms, additional law enforcement costs, externalities, and the unpredictability of complex systems where law and behavior have feedback effects are unaccounted for when the lawmaker attempts to make the law to maximize welfare based on only individual characteristics. Welfare maximization based only on individual characteristics does not necessarily result in welfare maximization in the aggregate or even welfare maximization for each individual. Examples from urban mobility illustrate the problems of creating algorithmic law based only on individual characteristics and the necessity of adequately incorporating interactive effects into the process of using algorithms to customize the law for each individual. This article proposes a method for making algorithmic law that assumes that every activity is interactive and adequately accounts for the interactive effects of individual behavior, particularly in terms of spatial effects and social norms. Whereas under previous proposals, lawmakers create the law for each individual separately, lawmakers using this process would make combinations of coordinated laws for all individuals simultaneously, and the coordinated laws would collectively maximize social welfare in each case. The result of applying this process is not making the law more differentiated but maintaining uniformity in the law in many situations."}}

Next, we create a temperature-driven dynamic hierarchical approach that classifies devices into fast and slow tiers based on their entropy values, allowing for differentiated weight aggregation via an attention mechanism. We also propose an entropy-triggered resource scheduling method to dynamically reduce communication traffic and utilize lightweight models. Experimental results show that this framework significantly improves convergence speed and lowers system overhead while preserving model accuracy. It demonstrates strong resilience in highly heterogeneous environments and non-IID data, offering an effective federated learning solution for resource-limited situations, such as industrial IoT."}}

Furthermore, tokenization incentivizes platforms to profitably transition away from commission-based revenue models. This shift is enabled through decentralized control: the platform is responsible for ICO issuance as compensation for relinquishing its conventional intermediary role; transaction validation is carried out by independent contributors; and tips to these contributors are set by producers. Our findings remain robust across settings with multiple producers, whether their product demands are independent, complementary, or substitutable, and consistently show that our proposed decentralized control mechanism leads to higher output."}}

Foreign companies are gradually closing their financial reporting. As of June 2025, only 70% of all legal entities owned by foreign owners have submitted financial statements for the previous year. Reporting is primarily withheld by the largest companies. Among the 100 largest foreign players in 2021, 86 reported for 2023, while only 43 did so for 2024. Smaller companies continue to submit data relatively steadily. This may indicate coordination of reporting with the Kremlin. Therefore, for the largest companies, to make year-to-year comparisons partially relevant, we are forced to extrapolate data from previous years in the absence of current data. \n<br>\n 2. The revenue of companies owned by foreigners before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine amounted to USD 201 billion in 2024. This is nearly the same as in 2023 (USD 198 billion) and significantly less than in 2021, when revenue was USD 320 billion. It can be concluded that the exit of foreign companies from the Russian market has halted, reaching a \"plateau\" in this process. \n<br>\n 3. The main part of this revenue is generated by companies classified by the KSE Institute as ‚Äústay‚Äù status ‚Äî these account for 68% of the total, or USD 136 billion. The remainder belongs to companies still in the process of exiting or those that have already transferred ownership (usually to local owners). There are more than 400 such companies, accounting for a quarter of the revenue (USD 50 billion) in 2024. \n<br>\n 4. Owners from Kremlin-friendly countries, such as China or Turkey, are playing an increasingly active role. In 2021, ‚Äúunfriendly‚Äù countries (a term used by the Kremlin referring to countries that did not condemn or directly supported Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, continue active trade or cooperation with Russia despite sanctions, and block or soften international initiatives against Russia) accounted for 95% of the revenue of foreign businesses in Russia. By 2024, this figure decreased to 82%. The main beneficiary is China, whose share grew from 2.7% to 14%. This also slows the process of further exits. Notably, the share of companies from the United States in total revenue has remained almost unchanged at around 19%, similar to the pre-invasion level of 20%. \n<br>\n 5. A separate issue concerns the performance results of companies that have already left the Russian market and, in most cases, have transferred ownership to local managers. Their share accounted for 25% of the total revenue of USD 201 billion in 2024. Most of these ownership changes occurred in 2022 and 2023. For example, if the share of sold companies in total revenue was 34% in the pre-war year, it decreased to 25% by 2024. This indicates that new local managers have not been able to restore pre-sale performance levels, raising questions about their ability to keep the business afloat. \n<br>\n 6. Net profit/loss in 2024 amounted to USD 19.5 billion ‚Äî a record for the last three years (it was USD 1 billion less in 2021). Taxes paid have hardly changed compared to the pre-war year (USD 5.6 billion). These figures may indicate that foreign companies, especially those from Kremlin-friendly countries such as China and Turkey, continue to operate in a less competitive environment with higher business margins, even amid declining overall turnover. \n<br>\n 7. Paid corporate income taxes have slightly decreased (to USD 6 billion), but the total tax burden ‚Äî including excise taxes and others ‚Äî is difficult to assess, not least due to the opacity of financial reporting and completely closed information on certain types of taxes. In a typical company with average profitability (margin of 10‚Äì20%), the tax burden from total revenue is around 10‚Äì15%. Previously, we estimated the total taxes paid by foreign companies to be between USD 20‚Äì30 billion."}}

Our analysis reveals a \"crypto home bias with flight-to-safety,\" whereby retail investors respond to regulatory tightening by reallocating assets toward large, compliant domestic exchanges rather than engaging in cross-border regulatory arbitrage. This flight-to-safety behavior is particularly pronounced among smaller investors, whose share of total deposits flowing into South Korea's largest exchanges increased significantly following the regulatory shift. We further find that reserves at noncompliant exchanges declined sharply-by 61.7% relative to compliant domestic counterparts-indicating heightened investor sensitivity to platform risk. These results suggest that retail investors prioritize domestic regulatory compliance and platform safety, highlighting how local regulatory shocks in supranational cryptocurrency markets can trigger flight-to-safety dynamics driven by investor risk aversion and home bias."}}

We introduce a novel tIRDPG-LID, a twin-imitation recurrent deterministic policy gradient model that learns from imperfect demonstrations, to address partial observability and overestimation bias in feature-scarce HFT scenarios. Our approach enriches the feature space via feature interpolation to mitigate the scarcity typical in HFT, then uses a trajectory discrimination mechanism and dynamic weighting to integrate and filter imperfect demonstration data. The trajectory discrimination mechanism compares each demonstration's performance to the agent's current returns and only emphasizes those expert actions that yield a positive advantage. Simultaneously, twin critics with delayed actor updates stabilize training under high volatility, reducing estimation errors and excessive risk. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework based on data entropy, showing how enriched features improve agent performance under partially observable conditions. Empirical evaluations on large-scale CSI 300 (IF) and CSI 500 (IC) futures confirm that tIRDPG-LID statistically significantly outperforms standard baselines by consistently delivering higher returns and improved risk adjusted metrics. Beyond HFT, the ability of the method to fuse imperfect demonstrations, mitigate overestimation bias, and adapt in real time suggests a wider applicability in other domains where data are scarce or partially observed. By uniting twin critics, imitation learning, and feature-space enrichment under a formal theoretical lens, tIRDPG-LID not only provides a novel solution for Fintech practice, but also extends deep reinforcement learning techniques more generally."}}

Addressing these concerns, this article reviews the U.S. data breach notification laws at the state level to inform the drafting of a much-needed federal law. We analyze the content of the laws considering when they were enacted, the definition of personal information, the notification deadline, and the regulatory strictness which we define as the combination of biometrics, restricted reporting deadlines, and health/medical information. We hypothesized that: (1) the contents of the laws have changed from their original content, (2) there is a relationship between the contents of the law and when the original law was passed, and (3) one political party would dominate when the original law was passed. We found our first hypothesis to be true that the laws have changed content from their original passage. Approximately 70% of the state laws have been amended. Our research also supports our second hypothesis that."}}

The tame econometric models offer a strong framework on which causal inference can be formulated but they are sometimes limited when it comes to dealing with complex highdimensional data. Machine learning (ML) methods can be contrasted with extracting causality where a black box is transparent in causal interpretation but not in prediction and patterns. This article discusses how useful machine learning can be as an effort in synergizing it with econometric models to benefit business surveys in causal assumptions. Through the analysis of the critical methodological synergies (the application of causal forests, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and uplift modeling) the study proves that the integration of the strengths of predictive ability of machine learning and the inference strength of econometrics can provide more specific and useful information. The paper demonstrates the application of these hybrid methods based on the case studies in a wide range of the retail price, workforce productiveness, and marketing analytics. In the analysis, one does not merely see improvement in terms of forecast precision but also improvement in terms of supporting policy and investment decisions to be made with causality. The interpretation constraints, the selection problem, and ethical issues are also evaluated critically. The results give recommendation to the fact that an integrative model holds stronger and responsive business approaches which is opening up to evidence-based leadership in complicated circumstances in the market. Finally, the work has already entered the developing debate on interdisciplinary analytics, arguing that a reciprocating approach should rely on both predictive and explanatory research."}}

While technical progress has been rapid, with over $25 billion in tokenized RWAs brought on-chain as of 2025, liquidity remains a critical bottleneck. This paper investigates the gap between tokenization and tradability, drawing on recent academic research and market data from platforms such as RWA.xyz. We document that most RWA tokens exhibit low trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation, despite their potential for 24/7 global markets. Through case studies of tokenized real estate, private credit, and tokenized treasury funds, we present empirical liquidity observations that reveal low transfer activity, limited active address counts, and minimal secondary trading for most tokenized asset classes. Next, we categorize the structural barriers to liquidity, including regulatory gating, custodial concentration, whitelisting, valuation opacity, and lack of decentralized trading venues. Finally, we propose actionable pathways to improve liquidity, ranging from hybrid market structures and collateral-based liquidity to transparency enhancements and compliance innovation. Our findings contribute to the growing discourse on digital asset market microstructure and highlight that realizing the liquidity potential of RWAs requires coordinated progress across legal, technical, and institutional domains."}}

More significantly, there is a notable gap in the rigorous assessment of the public implications of e-government initiatives. This implies the necessity of undertaking up-to-date, rigorous assessments at the project, institutional, regional, and national levels. Furthermore, study outcomes suggest the urgent and vital need for a framework that measures the progress of less mature e-government, taking into account the unique socio-technical dimensions of a developing economy like Sri Lanka.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges that the service harms sellers and consumers through coerced adoption and excessive fees, while Amazon defends it as helping sellers deliver superior service to consumers. Motivated by this antitrust debate, we develop a stylized model with rival platforms, where Platform A offers a qualityimproving fulfillment service (hereafter, FBA) alongside third-party logistics (3PL), while Platform B only offers 3PL. Sellers pay commissions and fulfillment fees. We define FBA as \"subsidized\" when it delivers a positive net fulfillment value (NFV), i.e., its logistics quality advantage over 3PL exceeds their fulfillment fee differential. Seller adoption of FBA is profitable and voluntary when the NFV is sufficiently large, but a higher commission rate makes adoption less likely. Platform A's provision of FBA is profitable under high quality advantage and moderate fulfillment fee. These conditions give rise to three equilibrium regions: 1) In the region of profitable provision and voluntary adoption, FBA always improves consumer surplus and may increase social welfare under certain conditions. 2) In the region of profitable provision but involuntary adoption, Platform A may have incentives to push FBA adoption at the expense of consumers, demonstrating the potential and consequences of coerced adoption. 3) In the region of unprofitable provision, a sufficient subsidy by Platform A induces seller adoption of FBA, leading to increased consumer surplus, which effectively turns FBA into a form of predatory pricing to erode Platform B's market share."}}

The study covered a 20-year period (2005-2024) and utilized secondary data sourced from UBA's audited financial statements. An ex-post facto research design was adopted, and multiple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analyses were conducted using EViews software, accompanied by trend analysis. To complement the quantitative analysis, SWOT and PESTLE frameworks were applied to provide strategic insights. The empirical findings revealed that EPS had a statistically significant and positive effect on LPAT (p = 0.0391), indicating that improved earnings per share enhance profitability. In contrast, ROA and DPS showed statistically insignificant effects on LPAT (p = 0.9634 and p = 0.6731, respectively), suggesting a limited direct impact on profitability within the study period. The model was statistically significant overall, as indicated by an F-statistic of 7.10 and a p-value of 0.0039, confirming the joint relevance of the independent variables. The study concludes that EPS is a key predictor of profitability in UBA and recommends that management prioritize strategies that boost earnings per share through enhanced operational efficiency and revenue optimization."}}

While disclosing costs can build consumer trust through transparency, it may also lead to resentment if the actual profit margin, deduced from the disclosed costs, is perceived as excessively high. By incorporating key findings from behavioral experiments in the literature, we present an exploratory model to examine if and when a firm should disclose its costs in both monopoly and duopoly markets. Assuming that consumers use the concept of rational expectation equilibrium to infer the firm's actual costs when they are not disclosed, our equilibrium analysis yields the following results that provide insights when a retailer should adopt cost disclosure. Specifically, in the monopoly model, we find that consumers tend to overestimate the firm's true costs when the firm does not disclose them. This occurs because consumers use the observed price as a \"signal\" about the undisclosed true cost, and believe that the firm would set its price closer to the true cost. Also, a monopoly should not disclose its true costs to prevent pressure to lower its profit margin, especially when consumers are highly concerned about the firm's profit margin. This behavior persists in the duopoly model. In the duopoly model, we find two additional results: as competition intensifies, both firms are more likely to disclose their true costs in equilibrium to gain additional trust from consumers. However, when competition is moderate but the cost differential between firms is sufficiently high, only one firm would disclose its true costs in equilibrium."}}

In addition, SWOT and PESTEL frameworks were applied to provide strategic insights into internal and external influences on technology adoption. Findings revealed statistically significant relationships between perceived ease of use and contextual performance (p = 0.012), perceived usefulness and productive behavior (p = 0.001), and behavioral intention and adaptive performance (p = 0.001). However, facilitating conditions (p = 0.255) and social influence (p = 0.287) did not significantly affect task performance and innovation respectively. The study was limited by constraints in accessing disaggregated organizational data and regional staff deployment. The study concludes that while technology adoption positively impacts workforce performance, more attention should be given to institutional support systems and strategic alignment."}}

Through comprehensive analysis of the landmark Supreme Court decision in I.S. Sikandar v. K.

Subba Raju (2022) 12 SCC 321, as well as its application by various High Courts. This analysis reveals how the requirement to seek declaratory relief against termination serves as a foundational prerequisite that protects the integrity of contractual relationships and prevents courts from enforcing agreements that parties have validly terminated. The article also examines the limited circumstances where this principle might be distinguished, while confirming that the doctrine remains firmly established in Indian jurisprudence."}}

Seniority-based hierarchical ranking might promote collaboration through coordination, but it may also induce conflicts that decrease collaboration efficiency. To consider this issue, this study looks at inventors' collaboration by constructing inventor-year panel data between 2010 and 2019. We find that seniority-based hierarchical ranking improves inventor collaborative innovation as manifested by the number of co-patents, supporting the effect of promoting coordination. Moreover, the positive relation between seniority-based hierarchical ranking and inventor co-patents is more significant in regions with a stronger Confucian culture, in industries with higher knowledge intensity, in firms that are more dependent on teamwork, and in non-state-owned enterprises. Further tests find a substitution relationship between seniority-based hierarchy system and performance-based incentive system: specifically, the effect of seniority-based hierarchical ranking on inventor collaboration is more pronounced when a firm provides less equity incentives to its technical employees. In addition, seniority-based hierarchical ranking improves inventor collaborative innovation through increasing inventors' cooperation breadth rather than its depth. Finally, it improves incremental corporate innovation but not breakthrough innovation. These findings provide new angles for understanding the role that seniority-based hierarchical ranking plays in collaborative innovation from the inventor level."}}

In Japan, a rigid work culture contributes to high levels of occupational stress and burnout, including karoshi (death by overwork); in South Africa, professionals face stressors linked to job insecurity, resource constraints, and workload imbalances; and in the Netherlands, despite progressive labor policies, sector-specific stressors remain prevalent. This review paper explores these variations in chronic workplace stress and examines the role of self-care and health promotion initiatives, while also identifying critical gaps in the current literature across Japan, South Africa, and the Netherlands to suggest directions for future research. Employing a narrative approach that allows for a comprehensive overview of diverse perspectives without the constraints of predefined inclusion criteria, this review synthesizes findings from peer-reviewed literature and authoritative reports. The findings shed light on how occupational health policies, supportive workplace cultures and structures, health promotion, and targeted stress management strategies play a vital role in addressing work-related stress. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these measures varies substantially across national contexts, underscoring the need for tailored, contextspecific approaches. This study concludes that although current interventions demonstrate varying levels of effectiveness, they also reveal significant gaps that highlight the need for more integrated, evidence-based, and context-sensitive strategies for managing chronic workplace stress."}}

However, much of the existing literature assumes that the buyer's valuation distribution is exactly known-a condition rarely met in practice. To bridge this gap, we study the robust mechanism design with general concave objective functions. The challenges encountered in analyzing these problems stem from their inherent nature as infinite-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems. We employ piecewise linear approximation as the building block of our analysis to address these challenges. As a result, we provide a detailed characterization of the optimal solution, which includes the properties of the optimal mechanism, the optimal support set, and the structure of objective function under the optimal mechanism. As a byproduct, we show that when the objective is a concave piecewise linear function, the dual of the robust mechanism design problem can be reduced to a minimax pricing problem, where the posted price emerges as the optimal solution. The latter problem itself is a classic economic problem and closely related to issues studied in the buyer-optimal pricing and personalized pricing literature. On the algorithmic side, we identify and transform the optimality conditions of the robust mechanism into a series of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and derive semi-closed-form solutions, thereby reducing the originally infinite-dimensional problem to a finite-dimensional one. Based on that, we design an alternating iterative method to solve for the remaining unknown parameters. Finally, we summarize the proposed methods in a solution framework and validate its effectiveness by applying it to several robust nonlinear mechanism design problems in economics and operations management."}}

This paper examines how much freshness information retailers should disclose and evaluates its impact on retailer profitability and household food waste. We consider four practical levels of transparency (LoT) regarding RSL: i) minimum shelf-life only (LoT-0); ii) additionally average shelf-life (LoT-1); iii) further including a quantile-based risk guarantee (LoT-2); and iv) full RSL distribution disclosure (LoT-3). Our baseline model focuses on ambiguity-averse consumers who maximize their worst-case expected utility-reflecting behaviors of sustainability-oriented consumers. We find that greater transparency does not always lead to higher profits. The most profitable transparency level is either LoT-1 or LoT-2, depending on the product's price-to-value ratio. Moreover, surprisingly, simple information policy LoT-2 can achieve same profit as LoT-3 when LoT-3 yields the highest profit. With uniform pricing across LoTs, increased profits typically come with more household food waste. However, under transparency-contingent pricing and mild cost conditions, a moderate transparency level (LoT-2) achieves maximal profit while simultaneously reducing waste relative to other levels-a potential \"win-win.\" Extending the analysis to ambiguity-neutral consumers, who interpret ambiguity by maximizing entropy of the RSL distribution, reaffirms that more information does not guarantee higher profits. Notably, for this group, minimal transparency (LoT-0) consistently yields maximum profit and waste.&nbsp;"}}

Through empirical findings from semi-structured interviews of 58 decision-makers from state and non-state actors, the article discusses individual and collective actions made before, during and after the floods by combining insights on DMUU from spatial planning and governance literature underpinned by spatial-temporal and political ecology narratives. The article argues that factors such as community resourcefulness and decentralized governance appeared to facilitate effective decision-making under short-term uncertainty. However, the same factors did not have an intrinsic influence on decision-making under long-term uncertainty with current ways of decision-making regarding quarrying in ecologically sensitive areas likely obstructing sustainable long-term planning and land use transformation in Wayanad. The article concludes with recommendations for potential improvements in decision-making under long-term uncertainty in contexts with weak institutional mechanisms, chronic vulnerabilities and resource scarcity, through structural organizational change, cross-sectoral decision-making arenas, and decision-making frameworks that foregrounds heuristic, flexible, incremental, and cumulative actions across scales over time.</span>"}}

The proponents of CBDCs argue that their introduction would streamline the monetary policy transmission mechanism, enable novel policy interventions, and enhance data collection capabilities, ultimately leading to improved central bank performance. However, the current arrangements of monetary institutions result in central banks riddled with incentive and epistemic issues, which hinder their capacity to enact effective monetary policy. CBDCs not only fail to mitigate these problems but indeed exacerbate them. We argue that the central bank becomes more vulnerable to political interference and rent-seeking activities once equipped with a CBDC. Moreover, the enhanced ability to monitor economic activities may lead central banks to succumb to the 'pretense of knowledge syndrome,' thereby increasing the risk of misguided policy interventions. We conclude that there is a means-ends inconsistency in the monetary policy case for CBDCs."}}

The dashboard aimed to reduce information asymmetries by making these commitments more visible to passengers. We developed a 'shroudedness' index to assess pre-policy transparency and estimated the policy's causal impact using a difference-indifferences design with varying treatment intensity. Results show a significant rise in consumer complaints about flight disruptions, particularly from airlines that previously concealed this information. However, we find no improvement in airline performance regarding controllable delays or cancellations. These findings indicate that while transparency policies can enhance consumer oversight and awareness, they may not effectively discipline firms without enforceable standards or penalties.

DDD has proven effective in solving variants of the traveling salesperson problem, offering computational advantages over fully time-expanded formulations. However, its application to pickup-and-delivery problems with precedence and pairing constraints remains unexplored, although these problems are crucial for effective logistics operations in e-commerce settings in metropolitan areas. This paper presents a comprehensive application of DDD to pickup-and-delivery problem variants to minimize makespan. We propose DDD algorithms for three problem variants of increasing complexity: the Pickup-and-Delivery Traveling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows, the PDTSP-TW with time-dependent travel times, and the consideration of multiple capacitated vehicles as in the Pickup-and-Delivery Problem with Time Windows and time-dependent travel times. Our DDD algorithm incorporates network refinement strategies that utilize multiple solution paths and patience mechanisms, along with time budget allocation, to strike a balance between solution quality and computational efficiency. The computational results demonstrate that DDD consistently outperforms compact formulations across all problem variants. For single-vehicle variants, DDD finds optimal solutions for 100% of time-independent instances and 94-100% of time-dependent instances. The transition from time-independent to time-dependent variants increases computational requirements by 9.3%, while multi-vehicle variants reveal increased complexity but maintain the algorithmic advantages of DDD."}}

This paper investigates the effectiveness of such options in a platform that matches electric vehicle (EV) and fuel vehicle (FV) drivers with eco-conscious and eco-unconscious riders. We build a model to examine the platform's optimal two-sided pricing strategies for scenarios with and without a \"Green\" option, accounting for an EV penetration target that the platform has to abide by. Without the \"Green\" option, the platform charges the same price to all riders but may offer differentiated wages for EV and FV drivers. Our analysis shows that the platform voluntarily offers higher wages to EV drivers, resulting in higher EV penetration. With the \"Green\" option, the platform is able to offer two-sided differentiated pricing across both the rider and driver types. However, this can trigger a de-pooling effect, resulting in a mismatch between rider demand and driver supply. Furthermore, our finding reveals that, surprisingly, introducing a \"Green\" option does not necessarily guarantee a higher EV penetration rate, and can even lead to a \"greenwashing\" effect. That is, although seemingly \"Green\", it may backfire with worse environmental performance. Only when eco-conscious riders exhibit a moderate level of environmental concern can the \"Green\" option simultaneously enhance the platform's profitability and its environmental performance. Finally, regulatory bodies should proceed with caution, because setting an overly high EV penetration target may significantly harm the platform's profitability and in turn discourage the offering of the \"Green\" option."}}

However, limited youth involvement in decisions about how their data is reused risks perpetuating mistrust and deepening the inequalities that these services seek to address, particularly if young people choose to avoid seeking services or withhold critical information out of fear of misuse. Responsible data reuse to enhance service delivery must therefore be grounded in methodologies that meaningfully engage youth and reflect their preferences and expectations. This paper presents findings from the NextGenData project, which developed and piloted a scalable methodology for engaging young people aged 19-24 in co-designing responsible data reuse strategies. Conducted as a year-long participatory action research initiative across India, Tanzania, Moldova, and Kyrgyzstan, the approach implemented youth assemblies, deliberative methods, and localized facilitation by national partners to engage young people. The study emphasizes the importance of context-specific, culturally responsive facilitation, and sustained, multi-phase engagement as the foundation for establishing a social license for data reuse. We present recommendations for practitioners to embed youth-centered approaches in data governance and offer a publicly available toolkit for replication. By centering young people in data decisions, this methodology advances ethical, inclusive, and effective service delivery and digital self-determination for young generations."}}

Leadership plays a crucial role in influencing employees' decisions to remain with or leave an organization. This research paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of leadership in talent retention, with a particular focus on six leadership styles: Transformational, Transactional, Laissez-Faire, Servant, Autocratic, and Democratic. Each style is examined for its effectiveness in reducing turnover rates and fostering long-term employee commitment. The study draws on a robust review of existing literature and integrates recent empirical research to evaluate how different leadership approaches impact employee retention. Transformational and Servant leadership are highlighted as the most effective in promoting employee engagement and loyalty, while Laissez-Faire and Autocratic leadership are associated with higher turnover intentions due to their lack of support and rigid control, respectively. By analyzing these leadership styles, the paper provides insights into how organizations can adapt their leadership strategies to reduce turnover rates and retain key talent in the modern workforce. The findings underscore the importance of aligning leadership practices with organizational culture and employee expectations to create a work environment that not only attracts but also retains high-performing employees."}}

This paper addresses a gap in the literature by developing and validating a novel, psychometrically sound scale to diagnose organizational change readiness, grounded in the dynamic capabilities framework. Through a series of four studies, we generated and refined a set of items, establishing a reliable and valid five-factor structure. This structure, which we term the Organizational Readiness Scale (ORS), includes Strategic Scanning, Leadership Insights, Coordinating Structures, Dysfunctional Defensive Routines, and Organizational Openness. Using a large sample of 4,591 respondents from 255 organizations, we conducted exploratory factor analysis and confirmed the factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis (N = 2,296). Our findings provide initial evidence of criterion validity, demonstrating a serial mediation pathway where Strategic Scanning influences change performance through Leadership Insights and Dysfunctional Defensive Routines. Theoretically, this research advances the field by explicitly integrating managerial attention and emotional dynamics into the conceptualization of change readiness. For practitioners, the developed scale offers a critical diagnostic tool to assess and improve an organization's capacity for successful change."}}

Using a case study of Alpha Pharma, a leading pharmaceutical firm navigating the stringent requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, the study examines the interplay between regulatory compliance, innovation, and inter-organisational collaboration. Through empirical investigation, the findings reveal new behavioural economic hypotheses highlighting the role of social norms, trust, and network interdependencies in shaping sustainability strategies. These insights aim to advance behavioural economic literature and introduce a novel policy design innovation model for aligning firm-level practices with evolving regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the study underscores how behavioural factors influence resource allocation, decision-making heuristics, and adaptive learning processes in corporate sustainability efforts, offering actionable insights for firms seeking to integrate environmental and social considerations into strategic planning. Practical implications include recommendations for policymakers on creating effective compliance mechanisms and for firms on fostering behavioural change to achieve sustainable value co-creation."}}
