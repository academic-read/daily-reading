Through the use of fuzzy logic and multi-criteria decision analysis, the habitat suitability for three key species—cobia (Rachycentron canadum, Rachycentridae), barramundi (Lates calcarifer, Latidae), and orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides, Serranidae)—was evaluated with both equal and expert-derived weighting methods. Results indicate that Rachycentron canadum exhibits adaptability in the challenging conditions of the Persian Gulf, characterized by high salinity and temperature fluctuations. Conversely, Lates calcarifer and Epinephelus coioides show a preference for the more stable environments of the Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz. By incorporating weighted integration techniques, the study achieved greater consistency in results and identified areas with potential for sustainable aquaculture development. The research emphasizes the importance of considering socio-economic and logistical factors, such as market access and infrastructure, in future assessments to enhance operational feasibility. These findings suggest the need for evidence-based spatial planning that prioritizes regions with optimal environmental conditions while also addressing socio-economic aspects for the sustainable growth of Iran’s offshore cage aquaculture industry."}}

However, existing literature rarely explores the validity and applicability of decentralization theory from the perspective of location endowments. This study takes China’s county-to-city reform - a decentralization policy - as a point of entry to construct a decentralization model incorporating location endowments. Using county-level panel data from 1992 to 2009 and employing a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, the study evaluates the impact of county-to-city reform under the constraint of location endowments on county-level economic development. The findings reveal that the policy effects of local decentralization are constrained by location endowments. Specifically, in regions with poorer location endowments, county-to-city reform significantly inhibits local economic development. Indeed, mechanism analysis further indicates that in such disadvantaged regions, local decentralization under the county-to-city reform generates a “political resource curse” effect, which hinders economic growth through three channels such as distorted fiscal expenditure structures, corruption, and misallocation of land resources. The conclusions of this study provide a valuable perspective for understanding the conditions under which decentralization theory holds, while also offering rigorous empirical evidence for government agencies to design more targeted decentralization policies."}}

This reform expanded the scope of violation detection by influencing both emissions decisions and strategic detection avoidance behaviors. Employing difference-in-differences methods, we find that the reform significantly induced green innovation, proxied by firms’ green patenting. Moreover, the triple-difference estimators reveal that the reform effect is weaker among state-owned firms, which have fewer detection avoidance behaviors due to their ownership structure and should be less affected by the reform. The reform thus seems to have reduced the informational advantages of avoidance behaviors."}}
