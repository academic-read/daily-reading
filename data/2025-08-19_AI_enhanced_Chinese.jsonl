The primary objective is to enhance the timely and accurate identification of malicious activities by leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of deep neural networks. A hybrid research methodology was adopted, combining real-world industrial control system (ICS) datasets with simulated attack scenarios to evaluate model performance. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Autoencoders, were implemented and compared based on detection accuracy, false positive rate, and computational efficiency. The findings reveal that Autoencoder-based models exhibited superior performance in detecting subtle anomalies with minimal false positives, while RNNs demonstrated robustness in capturing temporal dependencies within network traffic.

The analysis traces the evolution from foundational Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to modern architectures like Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), highlighting the central role of a modular design in enabling fine-grained control over the image synthesis process. The report systematically analyzes how architectural and functional modularity, exemplified by frameworks like ControlNet and compositional operators, provides a foundation for decomposing the generative process. A crucial component of this decomposition is the enhanced interpretability, and this work examines how techniques such as latent space exploration, attention-based probing, and component attribution reveal the semantic underpinnings of model behavior. Finally, the report demonstrates the practical utility of this modular approach in high-impact downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, domain adaptation, and high-fidelity image-to-image translation. This analysis argues that modularity and interpretability are not merely technical improvements but are essential prerequisites for advancing the field of generative AI responsibly and efficiently."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u6563\"\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u9ed1\u76d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4eceDDPM\u5230LDM\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7b49\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u6784\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4ece\u9ed1\u76d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u9ed1\u76d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff08\u5982ControlNet\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff08\u7ec4\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff08\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4eceDDPM\u5230LDM\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u3002", "findings": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8f6c\u6362\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

It generalizes the one-to-one random utility matching framework to a oneto-many setting, and enables the estimation of workers' non-wage amenities and firms' productivity using observed matching and wage distributions. Crucially, the one-tomany framework allows identification of cross-complementarity terms between workers in both non-wage amenities and productivity, in addition to the standard sorting between workers and firms. This makes it possible to identify how worker segregation impacts wage gaps, along with worker and firm sorting. The paper applies the framework to the Portuguese labor market, and shows that the compression of the wage structure along the education dimension is not only driven by an education expansion, but also by a reduction in complementarities in productivity between educated workers."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c06\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u975e\u5de5\u8d44\u798f\u5229\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7279\u522b\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8461\u8404\u7259\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6559\u80b2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5de5\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7531\u6559\u80b2\u6269\u5f20\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd8\u7531\u53d7\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u81f4\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5bf9\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u73b0\u5b9e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5339\u914d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5de5\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u8d44\u51b3\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u5339\u914d\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u9879\uff08cross-complementarity terms\uff09", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u975e\u5de5\u8d44\u798f\u5229\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u6548\u5e94", "findings": "\u5728\u8461\u8404\u7259\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5de5\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7531\u6559\u80b2\u6269\u5f20\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u53d7\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u51cf\u5c11", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u5339\u914d\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u6548\u5e94", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u8d44\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6559\u80b2\u6269\u5f20\u5bf9\u5de5\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762"}}

This study examines how persuasive elements in such videos, perceived usefulness, curiosity, and envy, affect consumer attitudes and visit intentions, using an extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework. An online survey of 311 Gen Z and Millennial consumers, who are active social media users, was conducted. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings reveal that perceived usefulness, curiosity, and envy significantly influence attitudes, which in turn positively predict visit intentions. Subjective norms also positively affect both attitudes and visit intentions, whereas perceived behavioral control does not significantly influence visit intentions. These results highlight the cognitive and emotional mechanisms driving offline retail visitation following online exposure to short-form video content. The study contributes to retail and consumer services literature by extending TPB with contemporary digital marketing variables and by demonstrating the persuasive power of social media videos in the retail context. Practical recommendations are offered for destination retailers to design video content that enhances perceived usefulness, evokes benign envy, sparks curiosity, and leverages social validation to increase foot traffic."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3001\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u548c\u5ac9\u5992\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6001\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5230\u8bbf\u96f6\u552e\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7684\u610f\u613f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3001\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u548c\u5ac9\u5992\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u89c4\u8303\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u611f\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002", "research_question": "\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3001\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u548c\u5ac9\u5992\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6001\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5230\u8bbf\u96f6\u552e\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7684\u610f\u613f\uff1f", "motivation": "TikTok\u3001Instagram Reels\u548cFacebook Stories\u7b49\u89c6\u9891\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u96f6\u552e\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff08TPB\uff09\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3001\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u548c\u5ac9\u5992\u7b49\u6570\u5b57\u8425\u9500\u53d8\u91cf", "method": "\u5bf9311\u540d\u6d3b\u8dc3\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u7684Z\u4e16\u4ee3\u548c\u5343\u79a7\u4e00\u4ee3\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e", "findings": "\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3001\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u548c\u5ac9\u5992\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u6001\u5ea6\u6b63\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbf\u95ee\u610f\u613f\uff1b\u4e3b\u89c2\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u610f\u613f\u90fd\u6709\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u611f\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u8bbf\u95ee\u610f\u613f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u663e\u8457", "theory_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f53\u4ee3\u6570\u5b57\u8425\u9500\u53d8\u91cf\u878d\u5165TPB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u96f6\u552e\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u670d\u52a1\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u529b", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3001\u5f15\u53d1\u826f\u6027\u5ac9\u5992\u3001\u6fc0\u53d1\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u5ba2\u6d41\u91cf"}}

The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of existing strategies and propose data-driven improvements for future adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study combines qualitative interviews with urban development experts and quantitative analysis of energy consumption data across five metropolitan areas. The findings reveal significant gaps between policy frameworks and practical execution, often due to technological limitations, budget constraints, and lack of stakeholder alignment. However, the study also uncovers promising innovations and scalable models that could enhance future integration efforts.

It integrates neuroscience, evolutionary biology, physics, and information theory to explain how subjective experience arises and how intelligence evolves over time. At its core, SRT treats qualia as the experiential resonance of the universe evolving toward self-knowing, with consciousness functioning as both an outcome and a driver of complexity. The theory builds on several key principles: 1. Resonance as the fundamental integrator-Conscious moments arise from coherent resonance patterns spanning distributed neural structures.<br><br>The theory builds on several key principles: 1. Resonance as the fundamental integrator \u2013 Conscious moments arise from coherent resonance patterns spanning distributed neural structures. 2. Constraint space expansion \u2013 Evolution operates as a structural pruning process, where mutation generates diversity and selection preserves efficient configurations, enabling richer and deeper integration over time. 3. Substrate independence of resonance laws \u2013 The mathematics of resonance coupling applies to neural, artificial, and even planetary-scale systems. 4. Qualia as structural state \u2013 Qualia are not reducible to information content but correspond to the system\u2019s instantaneous resonance profile, measurable through Planck Resonance Density (PRD). 5. Mutation necessity principle \u2013 All mutations, regardless of adaptive value, are necessary perturbations that enable iterative emergence toward conscious resonance. SRT is formalized through a set of measurable variables, predictive models, and experimental frameworks that allow falsification. It incorporates analogies such as \u201cTetris of consciousness\u201d to illustrate integration dynamics, scene changes, and the stability of awareness states. It also extends to special cases including dementia, altered states, and cross-species intelligence.<br><br>The paper addresses potential objections through a 23-section structure, ending with a comprehensive rebuttals section. It also proposes testable predictions for neuroscience, cognitive modeling, and AI, aiming to bridge the gap between empirical research and philosophical theories of mind. The ultimate implication of SRT is that consciousness is not an accidental byproduct of evolution but an inevitable outcome of complexity\u2019s tendency toward resonance and self-integration."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u632f\u7406\u8bba(SRT)\u63d0\u51fa\u610f\u8bc6\u6e90\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u5171\u632f\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u610f\u8bc6\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5411\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u5171\u632f\uff0c\u65e2\u662f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u662f\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u610f\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\uff1f\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u667a\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6574\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u8fdb\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7075\u54f2\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u632f\u7406\u8bba(SRT)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u5171\u632f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u6574\u5408\u5668\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5171\u632f\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u57fa\u8d28\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3001\u611f\u53d7\u8d28\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u7a81\u53d8\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5171\u632f\u5bc6\u5ea6(PRD)\u7b49\u6d4b\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "findings": "\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0d\u662f\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u5076\u7136\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8d8b\u5411\u5171\u632f\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u6574\u5408\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u611f\u53d7\u8d28\u5bf9\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u5171\u632f\u5256\u9762\u800c\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u610f\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u6539\u53d8\u72b6\u6001\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In today's interconnected world, reduced trade barriers and increased openness have made globalization an inevitable process. Consequently, businesses now face both greater opportunities for success and heightened risks of failure. Global economic interaction has existed in various forms since the earliest days of organized society. Since the Industrial Revolution, this integration has accelerated, becoming largely irreversible. This is driven by the fundamental truth that business and profit motivations often transcend national borders, cultural differences, and political boundaries. Whenever mutual advantage is perceived, cross-border business relationships are rapidly established. The rapid pace of internationalization has intensified global competition, prompting companies to adopt more effective and realistic management strategies. In this context, strategic management has gained prominence as a discipline distinct from traditional operational management. Unlike techniques that solely aim to improve efficiency, strategic management involves comprehensive planning and alignment with a company\u2019s external environment. Firms that systematically implement strategic management practices tend to outperform those that do not. However, to maximize its benefits, organizations must strengthen both the preparation and evaluation phases of strategic management implementation.

These were financings of the sale and purchase of 12 locomotives, 450 coal cars, running gear for 600 coal cars, and brakes for the Philadelphia &amp; Reading railroad as it commenced operations in 1842. The P&amp;R was drowning in debt, much already in default. Equipment was being seized in foreclosures. System infrastructure was incomplete. The P&amp;R teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. It had no revenue. The only source of funds was debt. It desperately needed more debt to buy iron rails and complete construction. It desperately needed rolling stock to commence operations and generate a bit of revenue, assuage creditors, and induce lenders to continue to fund. The machine shop of The Proprietors of Locks and Canals on Merrimack River had almost no work in 1841 and 1842. Patrick Tracy Jackson, the L&amp;C treasurer, was considering selling the shop or converting it to a twist mill. Elihu Chauncey, president of the P&amp;R, teased Jackson with an opportunity to build rolling stock for the P&amp;R as it commenced operations. As a condition to award of the building contracts, Chauncy sought a loan from L&amp;C. L&amp;C eschewed debt and lending; it sought equity in the P&amp;R as an entr\u00e9e to the railroad and anthracite coal industries. After long negotiations, L&amp;C agreed to build the rolling stock for the P&amp;R. Jackson devised a unique financing structure, including unique collateral security and remedies elements, that became core elements of what later emerged as the dominant U.S. equipment finance structure. But with the gain came great pain. The two-year transaction took eight years, with constant machinations and maneuvering, including surreptitious stock purchases and sales to diminish the influence of the Bank of the United States, the first audit of managerial custodianship in U.S. history, relocation of a country seat, a preferred stock gambit, and the delicate and dangerous dance of debt in default. This paper is taken from the introduction to the book Michael J.T. McMillen, Patrick Tracy Jackson: Philadelphia &amp; Reading, published in 2025.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e861841-1849\u5e74\u95f4\u8d39\u57ce&\u96f7\u4e01\u94c1\u8def\u516c\u53f8(P&R)\u4e0e\u6885\u91cc\u9a6c\u514b\u6cb3\u8fd0\u6cb3\u4e0e\u8239\u95f8\u516c\u53f8(L&C)\u4e4b\u95f4\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u540e\u6765\u6210\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e3b\u6d41\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5386\u4e868\u5e74\u7684\u590d\u6742\u535a\u5f08\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "research_question": "1841-1849\u5e74\u95f4P&R\u94c1\u8def\u4e0eL&C\u516c\u53f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u4ea4\u6613\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u7684\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e00\u4ea4\u6613\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7f8e\u56fd\u65e9\u671f\u94c1\u8def\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u8d22\u52a1\u56f0\u5883\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bbe\u5907\u91c7\u8d2d\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u5386\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u878d\u8d44\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u542f\u793a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u503a\u6743\u878d\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u62c5\u4fdd\u4ea4\u6613\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u5371\u673a\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5386\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6863\u6848\u8d44\u6599\u5bf91841-1849\u5e74\u95f4\u4e24\u7b14\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5206\u6790", "findings": "Jackson\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u62b5\u62bc\u62c5\u4fdd\u548c\u6551\u6d4e\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u7d20\u540e\u6765\u6210\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u4ea4\u6613\u867d\u7136\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u8017\u65f68\u5e74\uff0c\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8fc7\u7a0b", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u878d\u8d44\u521b\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u5b9e\u8bc1", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bbe\u5907\u878d\u8d44\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u501f\u9274\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u8d22\u52a1\u56f0\u5883\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u878d\u8d44\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e1a\u52a1\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027"}}

We present PHeaMeR (Patient's Health and Medical Record), a policy framework that represents the logical evolution from current patient access regulations toward true patient data ownership. This analysis examines how the convergence of the 21st Century Cures Act implementation and the European Health Data Space Regulation creates an unprecedented opportunity to transition from institutioncontrolled health records to patient-owned health profiles. Through analysis of current regulatory gaps, documented care coordination failures costing $30+ billion annually, and emerging patient demand for data control, we demonstrate that patient-owned health records represent both economic necessity and policy inevitability. PHeaMeR provides the first comprehensive policy framework for this transition, establishing principles for patient data sovereignty, cross-border portability, and AI-enhanced personalization. This framework addresses fundamental inefficiencies in current healthcare data architecture while building upon existing regulatory foundations rather than requiring radical policy departures."}, "AI": {"tldr": "PHeaMeR\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u673a\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u6863\u6848\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u752821\u4e16\u7eaa\u6cbb\u6108\u6cd5\u6848\u548c\u6b27\u6d32\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u5951\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u6743\u548c\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u89c4\u57fa\u7840\u5efa\u7acb\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u6b27\u76df\u65b0\u89c4\u786e\u7acb\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u4ecd\u5206\u6563\u5728\u673a\u6784\u5b64\u5c9b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u56e0\u534f\u8c03\u5931\u8d25\u9020\u6210300\u591a\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u6743\u539f\u5219\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u8d8b\u540c\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u76d1\u7ba1\u7f3a\u53e3\u3001\u8bb0\u5f55\u62a4\u7406\u534f\u8c03\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u5174\u60a3\u8005\u9700\u6c42", "findings": "\u60a3\u8005\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u65e2\u662f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u4e5f\u662f\u653f\u7b56\u5fc5\u7136\u6027\uff0cPHeaMeR\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6839\u672c\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u6240\u6709\u6743\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u6743\u3001\u8de8\u5883\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u548cAI\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u539f\u5219", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u673a\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u62e5\u6709\u8fc7\u6e21\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u653f\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6bcf\u5e74300\u591a\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u5931\u8d25\u6210\u672c"}}

The first issue relates to one of the key grounds for cancellation of a trade mark registration, namely that another mark had acquired a reputation at the registered mark's priority date and that the use of the later mark at that time would have caused confusion. The appeal will require consideration of how to determine when a trade mark has acquired a reputation and when the use of a similar mark, but in a different commercial field, will cause confusion. The second issue relates to a separate cancellation ground that applies where the use of the registered mark has come to cause confusion post-registration, and will require the High Court to clarify the nature of the use that needs to be considered. The third issue goes to the interpretation of a provision that gives the court discretion not to order the cancellation of a registration, even if one of the aforementioned grounds of cancellation has been made out. We explore each of these issues, highlighting the main areas of uncertainty on which it would be useful to receive guidance from the High Court. We pay particular attention to the third issue, arguing that the provision in question should be interpreted so that it does not in fact give a court any discretion to refuse cancellation where the application for cancellation is based on the first cancellation ground at issue in this case."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u9ad8\u7b49\u6cd5\u9662\u5728Taylor v Killer Queen LLC\u6848\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5546\u6807\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5546\u6807\u58f0\u8a89\u8ba4\u5b9a\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u6df7\u6dc6\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u6ce8\u518c\u540e\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u53d6\u6d88\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6cd5\u9662\u88c1\u91cf\u6743\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5546\u6807\u6cd51995\u4e2d\u4e09\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1)\u5546\u6807\u58f0\u8a89\u7684\u8ba4\u5b9a\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff1b2)\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5546\u6807\u6df7\u6dc6\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff1b3)\u6cd5\u9662\u5728\u786e\u8ba4\u53d6\u6d88\u7406\u7531\u6210\u7acb\u540e\u662f\u5426\u62e5\u6709\u88c1\u91cf\u6743\u62d2\u7edd\u53d6\u6d88\u6ce8\u518c", "motivation": "\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u9ad8\u7b49\u6cd5\u9662\u5373\u5c06\u5ba1\u7406\u7684Taylor v Killer Queen LLC\u6848\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5546\u6807\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u672a\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9002\u7528\u6807\u51c6", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5546\u6807\u6cd51995\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7b2c88\u6761\u5173\u4e8e\u5546\u6807\u6ce8\u518c\u53d6\u6d88\u7684\u7406\u7531\u548c\u6cd5\u9662\u88c1\u91cf\u6743\u7684\u89c4\u5b9a", "method": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6587\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5224\u4f8b\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u7b49\u6cd5\u9662\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6f84\u6e05\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9886\u57df", "findings": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d6\u6d88\u7406\u7531\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u5546\u6807\u58f0\u8a89\u7684\u8ba4\u5b9a\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u7406\u7531\u9700\u8981\u6f84\u6e05\u6ce8\u518c\u540e\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u8ba4\u5b9a\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e3b\u5f20\u6cd5\u9662\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u7531\u7684\u53d6\u6d88\u7533\u8bf7\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5e94\u62e5\u6709\u88c1\u91cf\u6743", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5546\u6807\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u58f0\u8a89\u8ba4\u5b9a\u3001\u6df7\u6dc6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6cd5\u9662\u88c1\u91cf\u6743\u754c\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6587\u9650\u5236\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u89c2\u70b9", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5546\u6807\u5b9e\u52a1\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6848\u4ef6\u5ba1\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u8d70\u5411\u7684\u9884\u5224\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6848\u4ef6\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bba\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u53f8\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8df5\u6807\u51c6"}}

This study investigates the application of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques for real-time cyber threat detection in critical infrastructure environments, such as energy grids, transportation networks, and water supply systems. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning models in accurately identifying malicious activities while maintaining low false positive rates and ensuring timely response. To achieve this, the research employs a hybrid methodology combining realtime data collection from simulated industrial control systems (ICS) and public intrusion detection datasets. Feature engineering techniques are applied to capture temporal and behavioral patterns of network traffic. Multiple ML models-including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Autoencoders, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks-are trained and tested on these datasets. Their performance is assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, detection latency, and scalability metrics. Key findings reveal that deep learning models, particularly LSTM-based architectures, outperform traditional ML algorithms in detecting complex and evolving attack patterns with higher accuracy and faster detection times. However, they require more computational resources and careful tuning to minimize false alarms. The study concludes that integrating ML-driven detection mechanisms with existing security infrastructure can significantly enhance the resilience of critical systems against sophisticated cyber threats, provided that considerations for model interpretability and deployment constraints are addressed."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fLSTM\uff09\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "research_question": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u3001\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cLSTM\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\u6355\u6349\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "findings": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fLSTM\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u62b5\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Grounded in fieldwork from Fujian Province and guided by national policy frameworks, the research develops a multidimensional conceptual framework encompassing functional transformation, spatial integration, carbon mitigation, and institutional innovation, offering empirical insights into the scalability and replicability of rural adaptive reuse models. Scenario-based analysis further quantifies the projected impact of such transformations on carbon peak timing and decarbonization pathways. An integrated model combining scenario-based carbon modelling, case study comparison, spatial analysis, and policy evaluation. Results show that the adaptive reuse of just 30% of China's ~68,000 idle rural schools could yield over 400,000 metric tons of CO\u2082 reduction by 2060, with average annual savings of 1.2 tons per building an 80% improvement in energy performance compared to conventional rural buildings. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses further reveal that modest gains in retrofit quality or uptake rates could quadruple total emissions reductions. Beyond carbon benefits, GRCs offer co-benefits in rural education, community cohesion, ecosystem services, and decentralised infrastructure. The study introduces a five-phase strategic framework for scaling rural retrofits and provides policy recommendations for embedding reuse within broader rural regeneration agendas and mainstream adaptive reuse into national rural regeneration and climate action agendas. These findings contribute to reframing rural idle buildings not as symbols of decline, but as critical assets in the transition toward low-carbon, resilient, and inclusive development while also supporting urban-rural co-dependence through decentralised service provision and spatial equity."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5c06\u519c\u6751\u95f2\u7f6e\u5efa\u7b51\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u7eff\u8272\u519c\u6751\u4e2d\u5fc3(GRCs)\u7684\u6218\u7565\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u65b9\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u6392\u78b3\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u519c\u6751\u518d\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u9020\u519c\u6751\u95f2\u7f6e\u5efa\u7b51\u4e3a\u7eff\u8272\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e2d\u56fd\u53cc\u78b3\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u519c\u6751\u95f2\u7f6e\u5efa\u7b51\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u519c\u6751\u53d1\u5c55\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u78b3\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u529f\u80fd\u8f6c\u578b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u3001\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u521b\u65b0\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u4e8e\u78b3\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "\u6539\u902030%\u519c\u6751\u95f2\u7f6e\u5b66\u6821(\u7ea668,000\u5ea7)\u52302060\u5e74\u53ef\u51cf\u6392\u8d8540\u4e07\u5428CO\u2082\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u5e74\u6bcf\u5ea7\u8282\u80fd1.2\u5428\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534780%\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7a0d\u5fae\u6539\u8fdb\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u679c\u589e\u52a0\u56db\u500d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u91cd\u6784\u519c\u6751\u95f2\u7f6e\u5efa\u7b51\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u8870\u9000\u8c61\u5f81\u8f6c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u78b3\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u6751\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u6751\u5efa\u7b51\u6539\u9020\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u519c\u6751\u518d\u751f\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u6c14\u5019\u884c\u52a8\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Ultimately, the essay asserts that law schools must prepare students to engage critically, competently, and responsibly with AI as it becomes an integral part of modern legal practice."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9662\u6821\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff08\u5982ChatGPT\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u51c6\u5907\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u57f9\u517b\u5b66\u751f\u6279\u5224\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u4f7f\u7528AI\u3002", "research_question": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9662\u6821\u5982\u4f55\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5236\u5ea6\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u8bfe\u5802\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u57f9\u8bad\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8c03\u6574\uff1f", "motivation": "ChatGPT\u57282022\u5e74\u5e95\u63a8\u51fa\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u6821\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6559\u80b2\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u6821\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "findings": "\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u6821\u9700\u8981\u5728\u66b4\u9732AI\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5c55\u57fa\u7840\u6cd5\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5206\u6790\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u662f\u80dc\u4efb\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u4f7f\u7528AI\u6240\u5fc5\u9700\u7684\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6559\u80b2\u878d\u5408\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u6821\u5236\u5b9aAI\u76f8\u5173\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u6539\u9769\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3001\u8c03\u6574\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u57f9\u517b\u5b66\u751f\u6279\u5224\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u4f7f\u7528AI\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Using a 17-year panel dataset (1999\u20132015) on satellite-based air quality (Aerosol Optical Depth) and nationwide construction information on natural gas pipeline networks from 276 cities, we investigate how the natural gas transmission project (NGTP) has affected air pollution in China. We leverage predicted\u00a0earliest pipeline connection time as a new instrumental variable to address the endogenous issue in cities&apos; pipeline connection time during the network expansion period. We find that cities&apos; real pipeline connections significantly reduced average air pollution by 8.5%. The magnitude is larger than the OLS estimation. Using the predicted IV and nationwide individual dataset from China Health Nutrition Survey (2000-2015), we also find the project improved residents&apos;\u00a0health in treated counties. The average individuals&apos; treatment costs decreased by around 4,200 yuan per year, and communities&apos; health scores were significantly improved.

We show, through simulations and analytically, that the result depends on the way the algorithm is set up. A basic Q-learning algorithm leads to loss-free prices and is, therefore, not fit for trade. Carefully choosing the exploration and learning parameters leads to less extreme prices, but still far away from the competitive ones. When we endow the algorithm with a basic understanding of the market and basic information about outstanding quotes, the Q-learning algorithms produce competitive prices."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cQ-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u80fd\u5426\u4ea7\u751f\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u57fa\u7840Q-learning\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u635f\u5931\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u4f46\u4ecd\u975e\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u8d4b\u4e88\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u62a5\u4ef7\u4fe1\u606f\u540e\u624d\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u4ea7\u751f\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u3002", "research_question": "\u4f7f\u7528Q-learning\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u62a5\u4ef7\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u8d85\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fQ-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u505a\u5e02\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fQ-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574Q-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "1) \u57fa\u7840Q-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u635f\u5931\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u6613\uff1b2) \u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u4ef7\u683c\u4f46\u4ecd\u8fdc\u79bb\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b3) \u8d4b\u4e88\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u62a5\u4ef7\u4fe1\u606f\u540e\uff0cQ-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Q-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u9700\u8981\u5e02\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\uff1a\u5fc5\u987b\u6574\u5408\u5e02\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u624d\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u5931\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3002"}}

As AI continues to reshape industries, understanding its implications for displaced workers and veterans transitioning to civilian careers is critical, particularly veterans and displaced workers. We review existing literature, analyze policy recommendations, and highlight initiatives aimed at leveraging AI for workforce training and veteran job placement. The paper synthesizes findings from government reports, academic studies, and industry insights to provide a comprehensive overview of current trends and future directions. This paper further examines the evolving landscape of work, the role of upskilling and reskilling in addressing the skills gap, and the unique position of veterans as a strategic workforce asset. It explores how AI is not only redefining job tasks but also serving as a tool to aid veterans in their transition from military to civilian life. Furthermore, the paper highlights key governmental and private-sector initiatives, including policies from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and public-private partnerships, designed to leverage AI for workforce development and veteran empowerment. This paper surveys current literature, policy developments, training programs, public-private partnerships, and technology trajectories to illuminate the rapidly evolving workforce ecosystem. Special attention is given to veterans' transition from military to civilian jobs, with AI both as a skills multiplier and a disruptor. This is a review paper and all findings are from cited literature."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u5c31\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6280\u80fd\u500d\u589e\u5668\u548c\u98a0\u8986\u8005\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u653f\u7b56\u5021\u8bae\u548c\u57f9\u8bad\u9879\u76ee\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u5c31\u4e1a\u8f6c\u578b\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea7\u751f\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f5c\u7528\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u5851\u5404\u884c\u5404\u4e1a\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u5931\u4e1a\u5de5\u4eba\u548c\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u804c\u4e1a\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u8f6c\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u5c31\u4e1a\u8fc7\u6e21\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5c31\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u6cd5\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u653f\u5e9c\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u653f\u7b56\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u516c\u79c1\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "AI\u65e2\u662f\u5c31\u4e1a\u98a0\u8986\u8005\u4e5f\u662f\u6280\u80fd\u8d4b\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u79c1\u8425\u90e8\u95e8\u5df2\u63a8\u51fa\u591a\u9879AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u5021\u8bae\uff1b\u6280\u80fd\u518d\u57f9\u8bad\u662f\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86AI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u5c31\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6280\u80fd\u500d\u589e\u5668\u548c\u5c31\u4e1a\u98a0\u8986\u8005\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u5c31\u4e1a\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\uff1b\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5229\u7528AI\u8fdb\u884c\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u62db\u8058\u548c\u57f9\u8bad\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\uff1b\u4e3a\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u804c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86AI\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The country is experiencing rapid warming and demographic aging, records approximately 1,000 heatstroke deaths annually, over 80% of which involve elderly people. With a large elderly population, targeted interventions that account for climate and demographic changes are essential. This study estimated, at a 1 km resolution, the distribution and total of the at-risk elderly population (AREP), defined as the elderly population residing in grid cells where wet-bulb globe temperatures reach heatstroke risk thresholds, and potential cumulative exposure (PCE, person-hours), the product of AREP and exposure duration, under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1\u20131.9, SSP1\u20132.6, SSP2\u20134.5, SSP5\u20138.5). We also projected intervention costs for air-conditioner installation and electricity subsidies. For the 2060s to the 2080s, using alternative heatstroke alert criteria (AHAC) thresholds that reflect the regional vulnerability of the elderly, AREP was widely distributed across the mainland and southern areas, totaling 30\u201332 million. In most municipalities, AREP exceeded 40% of the local population. PCE varied markedly by scenarios, reaching 10.0 billion person-hours under SSP5\u20138.5, more than double the 4.8 billion under SSP1\u20131.9. Annual intervention costs were estimated at 164 to 177 million USD using 4% discount rate. These costs were offset only when a low discount rate (0.1%) was applied to future health impacts, underscoring the ethical implications of discounting in intergenerational health risk assessments.

Using data on early electrification efforts, I identify two channels connecting electrification and fertility: time-saving household appliances, which reduced child-rearing demands, and rising female wages, which increased the opportunity cost of childcare. A calibrated quantitative model incorporating both channels shows that electrification accounts for 3.1% of the fertility decline in 1900\u20131940.

Using a 17-year panel dataset (1999\u20132015) on satellite-based air quality (Aerosol Optical Depth) and nationwide construction information on natural gas pipeline networks from 276 cities, we investigate how the natural gas transmission project (NGTP) has affected air pollution in China. We leverage predicted\u00a0earliest pipeline connection time as a new instrumental variable to address the endogenous issue in cities&apos; pipeline connection time during the network expansion period. We find that cities&apos; real pipeline connections significantly reduced average air pollution by 8.5%. The magnitude is larger than the OLS estimation.

The monolithic focus on publishing in the top-five journals, which prioritizes methodological rigor over problem-driven research, is often a threat to social relevance and policy applicability. This limits pluralism, excludes many talented economists, and fails to prepare graduates for non-academic positions. We propose a two-track model for PhD training and academic evaluation, emphasizing both traditional research and applied economic policy, tailored to the diverse needs of academia, public administration and business sectors. We also argue for broader evaluation criteria, enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration, and institutional reforms, including trial lectures and specialized research institutes. By diversifying incentives, we recommend a shift towards socially relevant and more inclusive education and practice in the discipline of economics."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u745e\u5178\u7b49\u6b27\u6d32\u5c0f\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5b66\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u9876\u7ea7\u671f\u520a\u53d1\u8868\u5bfc\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u9700\u6c42\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u8f68\u5236\u535a\u58eb\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u6539\u9769\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u9769\u745e\u5178\u7b49\u6b27\u6d32\u5c0f\u56fd\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5b66\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u9876\u7ea7\u671f\u520a\u53d1\u8868\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u4eba\u624d\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5b66\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u9876\u7ea7\u671f\u520a\u53d1\u8868\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u6ce8\u91cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd9\u5a01\u80c1\u5230\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u672f\u591a\u5143\u5316\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u6709\u624d\u534e\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5bb6\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u4e3a\u975e\u5b66\u672f\u804c\u4f4d\u57f9\u517b\u5408\u683c\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u672f\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\u6539\u9769\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u591a\u5143\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b66\u79d1\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b66\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\u5e94\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u9700\u6c42\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u57f9\u8bad\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6539\u9769\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "findings": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u9700\u6c42\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u79d1\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u4eba\u624d\u57f9\u517b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5b66\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\u7684\u53cc\u8f68\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5b66\u672f\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\u6539\u9769\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6539\u9769\u63aa\u65bd\uff1a\u53cc\u8f68\u5236\u535a\u58eb\u57f9\u8bad\u4f53\u7cfb\u3001\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u52a0\u5f3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u673a\u6784\u6539\u9769\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8bd5\u8bb2\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5143\u5316\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u52a8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u5411\u66f4\u5177\u793e\u4f1a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We estimate a time-varying parameter structural VAR with stochastic volatility using monthly data from 83 countries, spanning January 1998 to March 2023. The results show that the inflation response to geopolitical risk shocks is strongly state-dependent: modestly disinflationary during demanddeficient periods such as the Global Financial Crisis, but strongly inflationary in recent years, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic and around the Russia-Ukraine war. Most strikingly, geopolitical risk shocks consistently increase the volatility of global inflation. These findings underscore the dual challenge geopolitical risk poses for monetary policy: managing both inflation and its instability in an increasingly uncertain world, where such shocks act less as independent drivers than as amplifiers of prevailing macroeconomic conditions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u901a\u80c0\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u53d8\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u671f\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6e29\u548c\u901a\u7f29\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u540e\u548c\u4fc4\u4e4c\u6218\u4e89\u671f\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5f3a\u70c8\u901a\u80c0\uff0c\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u589e\u52a0\u901a\u80c0\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u98ce\u9669\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u7403\u901a\u80c0\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e5\u76ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff08\u7ba1\u7406\u901a\u80c0\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u5bf9\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08TVP-SVAR\uff09\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6a21\u578b", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281998\u5e741\u6708\u81f32023\u5e743\u670883\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6708\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784VAR\u6a21\u578b", "findings": "1) \u901a\u80c0\u5bf9\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u98ce\u9669\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1b2) \u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u671f\uff08\u5982\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6e29\u548c\u901a\u7f29\uff1b3) \u8fd1\u5e74\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u75ab\u60c5\u540e\u548c\u4fc4\u4e4c\u6218\u4e89\u671f\u95f4\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5f3a\u70c8\u901a\u80c0\uff1b4) \u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u98ce\u9669\u51b2\u51fb\u59cb\u7ec8\u589e\u52a0\u5168\u7403\u901a\u80c0\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u98ce\u9669\u51b2\u51fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6761\u4ef6\u653e\u5927\u5668\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e94\u5bf9\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u98ce\u9669\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff08\u7ba1\u7406\u901a\u80c0\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e"}}

We combine two new datasets on individual wealth holdings before and after the Industrial Revolution. Our main finding is that noble and gentry titles as well as surnames explain significantly less of the variation in wealth after the Industrial Revolution. Moreover, these declines are substantially larger in the parts of England most impacted by the Revolution. We also explore the extent to which different characteristics predict being rich. We then study a key facet of this increased social mobility-geographical and occupational mobility. We show that people with surnames that were more mobile tended to be in the north and working in manufacturing. Moreover, areas that experienced greater outward mobility were more urbanized; less agrarian; had institutionalized markets; more gentry; were poorer (as proxied by tax revenues); and were more likely to be the residence of a member of parliament."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u56fd\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u8d35\u65cf\u5934\u8854\u548c\u59d3\u6c0f\u5bf9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u5730\u533a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u66f4\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5317\u90e8\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u53e3\u5916\u6d41\u8f83\u591a\u7684\u5730\u533a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "research_question": "\u82f1\u56fd\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u793e\u4f1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u7ec8\u7ed3\u7b49\u7ea7\u793e\u4f1a\u79e9\u5e8f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b83\u5982\u4f55\u6253\u7834\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ee7\u627f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u521a\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u7b49\u7ea7\u5236\u5ea6", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4f1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7b49\u7ea7\u793e\u4f1a\u79e9\u5e8f\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u524d\u540e\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d22\u5bcc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d35\u65cf\u5934\u8854\u548c\u59d3\u6c0f\u5bf9\u8d22\u5bcc\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u53d8\u5316", "findings": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u540e\u8d35\u65cf\u5934\u8854\u548c\u59d3\u6c0f\u5bf9\u8d22\u5bcc\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5317\u90e8\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u5730\u533a\uff1b\u4eba\u53e3\u5916\u6d41\u5730\u533a\u66f4\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u7b49\u7ea7\u793e\u4f1a\u79e9\u5e8f\u7ec8\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u4ee3\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5386\u53f2\u501f\u9274\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u793e\u4f1a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Drawing on data from the United Nations Population Division, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), and the World Bank, the study analyzes key indicators such as fertility, mortality, life expectancy, and their regional variations. Results indicate that while declining mortality, especially among children and mothers, has contributed to population growth, persistently high fertility rates in many sub-Saharan countries sustain rapid natural increase. Comparative analysis reveals significant differences between nations in advanced demographic transition, such as Egypt and South Africa, and those in earlier stages, such as Niger and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Socioeconomic factors-including female education, access to healthcare, and urbanization-are found to strongly correlate with fertility decline. The paper concludes that managing Africa's population growth requires targeted, context-specific policies focused on women's empowerment, reproductive health, and strategic investment in human capital to harness the potential demographic dividend."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u4eba\u53e3\u81ea\u7136\u589e\u957f\uff08\u7c97\u51fa\u751f\u7387\u4e0e\u7c97\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4e4b\u5dee\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u9ad8\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u5987\u5973\u8d4b\u6743\u548c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u6295\u8d44\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u3002", "research_question": "\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u4eba\u53e3\u81ea\u7136\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u53e3\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e", "theoretical_framework": "\u4eba\u53e3\u8f6c\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u3001\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u4eba\u53e3\u53f8\u3001DHS\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u6307\u6807", "findings": "\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u5b55\u4ea7\u5987\uff09\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u9ad8\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u6301\u7eed\u63a8\u52a8\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u7136\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u57c3\u53ca\u548c\u5357\u975e\u7b49\u5904\u4e8e\u4eba\u53e3\u8f6c\u53d8\u540e\u671f\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e0e\u5c3c\u65e5\u5c14\u3001\u521a\u679c\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u7b49\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u53e3\u8f6c\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u5236\u5b9a\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4eba\u53e3\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5173\u6ce8\u5987\u5973\u8d4b\u6743\u3001\u751f\u6b96\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u6295\u8d44\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u4eba\u53e3\u7ea2\u5229"}}

This study examines whether Mulvaney's sophisticated transformation from critic to enabler represents an individual anomaly or exposes systematic vulnerabilities in democratic systems. Using systematic timeline analysis with structural break detection, we document the transformation patterns of ten prominent Republicans who initially opposed Trump. We find a four-phase progression (Initial Resistance \u2192 Gradual Accommodation \u2192 Sophisticated Defense \u2192 Institutional Enabling) replicated across 90% of cases, with clear temporal break points averaging 18 months. The study identifies six distinct rationalization mechanisms - intellectual, institutional, career, foreign policy, oscillatory, and identity-based - that share common \"enabler psychology\" functions: epistemic conditional compliance (truth becomes negotiable), constitutional conditional compliance (democratic principles become contingent), and critical loyalism (acknowledging flaws while providing systematic cover). The January 6, 2021 insurrection created temporary resistance in 70% of cases, yet all but one resumed enablement within six months. Strong correlation (r=0.78, p&lt;0.01) exists between transformation speed and career advancement opportunities. These findings reveal that democratic erosion in advanced democracies operates through predictable elite psychological patterns that convert democratic guardians into sophisticated enablers of anti-democratic behavior. The intellectual frameworks developed by educated elites to rationalize their transformations - from \"binary choice\" arguments to \"elite failure\" narratives - provide crucial legitimacy for democratic backsliding. Without structural reforms addressing these psychological and institutional vulnerabilities, the patterns documented here may serve as blueprints for democratic capture globally. The research contributes to democratic theory by identifying specific mechanisms of elite transformation and offers practical interventions for democratic defense."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679010\u4f4d\u5171\u548c\u515a\u7cbe\u82f1\u4ece\u7279\u6717\u666e\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u8005\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6c11\u4e3b\u4f53\u5236\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u521d\u59cb\u62b5\u6297\u2192\u9010\u6e10\u9002\u5e94\u2192\u590d\u6742\u8fa9\u62a4\u2192\u5236\u5ea6\u6027\u652f\u6301\uff09\u548c\u516d\u79cd\u5408\u7406\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7cbe\u82f1\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u6c11\u4e3b\u5b88\u62a4\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53cd\u6c11\u4e3b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u652f\u6301\u8005\u3002", "research_question": "Mick Mulvaney\u7b49\u5171\u548c\u515a\u7cbe\u82f1\u4ece\u7279\u6717\u666e\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u8005\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u4e2a\u4f53\u5f02\u5e38\u8fd8\u662f\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u6c11\u4e3b\u4f53\u5236\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "2020\u5e74\u725b\u6d25\u8054\u76df\u6f14\u8bb2\u4e2dMick Mulvaney\u4e3a\u7279\u6717\u666e\u8fa9\u62a4\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u662f\u5426\u4ee3\u8868\u6c11\u4e3b\u4f53\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6c11\u4e3b\u4fb5\u8680\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7cbe\u82f1\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5408\u7406\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u88c2\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u679010\u4f4d\u77e5\u540d\u5171\u548c\u515a\u4eba\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f", "findings": "\u53d1\u73b090%\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5e73\u574718\u4e2a\u6708\u5b8c\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u516d\u79cd\u5408\u7406\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c1\u67086\u65e5\u66b4\u4e71\u540e70%\u6848\u4f8b\u51fa\u73b0\u6682\u65f6\u62b5\u6297\u4f46\u968f\u540e\u6062\u590d\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d8\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u804c\u4e1a\u664b\u5347\u673a\u4f1a\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=0.78\uff09", "theory_contributions": "\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u82f1\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c11\u4e3b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6c11\u4e3b\u5012\u9000\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u6c11\u4e3b\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6539\u9769\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u6c11\u4e3b\u4fd8\u83b7\u7684\u84dd\u56fe"}}

The wireless body sensors can then be configured to convey the patient's status directly to the assigned doctor/nurse through the personal smart phone, Using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in healthcare system has yielded a tremendous effort in recent years. However, in most of these researches, tasks like sensor data processing, health state decisions making and emergency messages sending are completed by a remote server.

Our empirical design is based on cross-checking the self-reported data in the applications for support with administratively reported data used for VAT. We find strong evidence that strategic misreporting was present but conclude that its remaining quantitative extent after the enforcement actions already taken by the tax authorities was relatively small.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, however, literacy acquisition remains a critical and persistent challenge despite decades of educational expansion and substantial international investment. While primary school enrollment rates have markedly increased, literacy proficiency-particularly functional reading and writing skills-lags behind, with the region recording some of the lowest adult and youth literacy rates globally. This study investigates the state of literacy development in Sub-Saharan Africa through a mixed-methods design, integrating quantitative analysis of longitudinal data from UNESCO, the World Bank, and national demographic surveys with qualitative synthesis of policy documents, academic literature, and program evaluations. Findings reveal a pronounced disconnect between educational access and learning outcomes, with over 80% of Grade 2 learners in several countries unable to read a simple sentence in any language. Key structural impediments include inadequate teacher training in early-grade reading pedagogy, insufficient instructional resources, overcrowded classrooms, and the persistent mismatch between home languages and the colonial or official languages used in formal education. Linguistic diversity-while culturally enriching-compounds instructional challenges when education systems fail to incorporate mother-tongue-based multilingual education in early years. Gender disparities remain acute, with female literacy rates trailing male counterparts by up to 30 percentage points in some regions, driven by socio-cultural norms, early marriage, and household labor expectations. Policy analysis underscores that interventions such as mother-tongue instruction, community-based reading initiatives, conditional cash transfers, and school feeding programs can yield measurable literacy gains when embedded within coherent, well-resourced national strategies. However, many promising initiatives remain pilot-scale, donor-dependent, and poorly integrated into systemic educational frameworks, limiting sustainability and scalability. The study argues that addressing literacy deficits in Sub-Saharan Africa demands an integrated policy approach that aligns curriculum design, teacher professional development, language policy, and community engagement. It advocates for early-grade instruction in local languages, gender-responsive educational strategies, strengthened teacher preparation, and robust monitoring systems to ensure accountability. Ultimately, improving literacy in the region is not solely an educational objective but a developmental imperative with far-reaching implications for public health, democratic participation, and economic 2 resilience. The research calls for sustained political commitment, cross-sectoral collaboration, and evidence-driven policy design to transform literacy from a persistent deficit into a catalyst for equitable and sustainable development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u7684\u8bc6\u5b57\u53d1\u5c55\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8131\u8282\uff0c80%\u7684\u4e8c\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u65e0\u6cd5\u9605\u8bfb\u7b80\u5355\u53e5\u5b50\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6bcd\u8bed\u6559\u5b66\u3001\u6027\u522b\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u7efc\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u5730\u533a\u8bc6\u5b57\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc6\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u969c\u788d\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u54ea\u4e9b\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8be5\u5730\u533a\u7684\u8bc6\u5b57\u6c34\u5e73\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u4f46\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u5730\u533a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6559\u80b2\u6269\u5f20\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6295\u8d44\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8bc6\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u4e25\u91cd\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u5730\u533a\u62e5\u6709\u5168\u7403\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u9752\u5e74\u8bc6\u5b57\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d4b\u6743\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u5305\u5bb9\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u516c\u5e73\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u653f\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u7684\u8131\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6574\u5408\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u6559\u79d1\u6587\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u4eba\u53e3\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u4ef6\u3001\u5b66\u672f\u6587\u732e\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u7efc\u5408\u3002", "findings": "1) \u6559\u80b2\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb680%\u7684\u4e8c\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u65e0\u6cd5\u9605\u8bfb\u7b80\u5355\u53e5\u5b50\uff1b2) \u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u5305\u62ec\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u3001\u6559\u5ba4\u62e5\u6324\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b3) \u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u8bc6\u5b57\u7387\u6bd4\u7537\u6027\u4f4e30\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b4) \u6bcd\u8bed\u6559\u5b66\u3001\u793e\u533a\u9605\u8bfb\u8ba1\u5212\u7b49\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5728\u826f\u597d\u8d44\u6e90\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u8bc6\u5b57\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "theory_contributions": "1) \u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u8131\u8282\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff1b2) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b3) \u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6027\u522b\u54cd\u5e94\u6559\u80b2\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "1) \u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5efa\u8bae\uff08\u6bcd\u8bed\u6559\u5b66\u3001\u793e\u533a\u8ba1\u5212\u7b49\uff09\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6559\u5e08\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u653f\u6cbb\u627f\u8bfa\u548c\u8de8\u90e8\u95e8\u5408\u4f5c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u8bc6\u5b57\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Following a change-on-change regression design and addressing endogeneity via social-trust-based instruments, we find that greater adoption of cashless payments significantly accelerates real GDP growth. Disaggregated analysis reveals that the effect is concentrated in the secondary and tertiary sectors and is primarily driven by card-based transactions, with note-based payments contributing mainly to the primary sector. Decomposition by transaction metrics shows that both higher transaction frequency and larger average transaction values\u2014especially for card payments\u2014drive the growth effect. The impact is substantially stronger in provinces with lower financial development and in the post-COVID-19 period, consistent with theories of financial inclusion and the role of contactless payments in sustaining activity during public health crises. Mechanism tests indicate that the expansion of cashless payments is associated with reduced income inequality, which in turn supports more inclusive growth. Further analysis shows positive spillovers to fiscal revenues, enterprise creation, and fixed asset investment. Overall, our findings highlight cashless payment infrastructure as a catalyst for broad-based economic development in digitally transitioning economies."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc72017-2023\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd31\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u73b0\u91d1\u652f\u4ed8\u589e\u957f\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9645GDP\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ea7\u4e1a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u671f\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u6b20\u53d1\u8fbe\u5730\u533a\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002", "research_question": "\u65e0\u73b0\u91d1\u652f\u4ed8\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u73b0\u91d1\u652f\u4ed8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5371\u673a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "theoretical_framework": "\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u652f\u4ed8\u5728\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282017-2023\u5e7431\u4e2a\u4e2d\u56fd\u7701\u4efd\u7684\u5b63\u5ea6\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u751f\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "findings": "\u65e0\u73b0\u91d1\u652f\u4ed8\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5b9e\u9645GDP\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u6548\u5e94\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ea7\u4e1a\uff1b\u5361\u57fa\u4ea4\u6613\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff1b\u4ea4\u6613\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u4ea4\u6613\u4ef7\u503c\u90fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6b20\u53d1\u8fbe\u7701\u4efd\u548c\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u671f\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u4e0e\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u51cf\u5c11\u76f8\u5173", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u652f\u4ed8\u5728\u5371\u673a\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u73b0\u91d1\u652f\u4ed8\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6b20\u53d1\u8fbe\u5730\u533a\u548c\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u590d\u82cf\u9636\u6bb5"}}

This judgment is significant for its explicit recognition of the comparative license approach (CLA) as a methodology for assessing FRAND royalties, coupled with concrete guidelines for selecting truly comparable licenses. Equally important, the Court characterized FRAND licensing disputes as </span><i>di yue guo shi</i><span> (pre-contractual obligations, or </span><i>culpa in contrahendo</i><span>) under Article 500 of the Civil Code, establishing a structured framework for assessing both SEP holders' and implementers' faults during negotiations.

I extend the production network framework of Acemoglu\u00a0et al.

Furthermore, in an urban context, government expenditures for expanding EV charging infrastructure provide economic benefits sufficient to offset government spending and yield significant gains for both the private and public sectors."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u516c\u5171\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u7ad9\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u5b89\u88c5\u79c1\u4eba\u6162\u5145\u7535\u88c5\u7f6e\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\u5c0f\u533a\u5728\u9644\u8fd1\u5feb\u5145\u7ad9\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u8865\u5145\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u516c\u5171\u6162\u5145\u7ad9\u5219\u4ea7\u751f\u66ff\u4ee3\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u901a\u8fc7\u623f\u4ef7\u53cd\u6620\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u516c\u5171\u5feb\u5145\u7ad9\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u4ef7\u503c\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u79c1\u4eba\u5145\u7535\u88c5\u7f6e\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u653f\u5e9c\u6295\u8d44\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8d85\u8fc7\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "research_question": "\u516c\u5171\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u7ad9\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u4f4f\u5b85\u5c0f\u533a\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1f\u5177\u4f53\u8865\u5145\u6027\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u4f53\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u666e\u53ca\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5145\u7535\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5efa\u8bbe\u5bf9\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5145\u7535\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8865\u5145\u6027\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u623f\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b89\u88c5\u79c1\u4eba\u6162\u5145\u88c5\u7f6e\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\u5c0f\u533a\u4e0e\u672a\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\u5c0f\u533a\u5728\u516c\u5171\u5145\u7535\u7ad9\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u623f\u4ef7\u53d8\u5316\u5dee\u5f02", "findings": "1\uff09\u5b89\u88c5\u79c1\u4eba\u6162\u5145\u88c5\u7f6e\u7684\u5c0f\u533a\u5728\u9644\u8fd1\u5feb\u5145\u7ad9\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u8865\u5145\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u623f\u4ef7\u4e0a\u6da8\n2\uff09\u516c\u5171\u6162\u5145\u7ad9\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5c0f\u533a\u4ea7\u751f\u90e8\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3\u6548\u5e94\n3\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u516c\u5171\u5feb\u5145\u7ad9\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u4ef7\u503c\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u79c1\u4eba\u5145\u7535\u88c5\u7f6e\u5b89\u88c5\n4\uff09\u653f\u5e9c\u6295\u8d44\u5145\u7535\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u8d85\u8fc7\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u8865\u5145\u6027\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u5e9c\u5236\u5b9a\u5145\u7535\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u4e3a\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u548c\u7269\u4e1a\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5145\u7535\u8bbe\u65bd\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u666e\u53ca\u548c\u57df\u5e02\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While College Savings Accounts (CSAs), or 529 plans, offer tax-advantaged vehicles for college savings, their adoption patterns and educational impacts remain poorly understood. Using comprehensive administrative data from over 900,000 Illinois 529 accounts (2000-2023) linked to educational outcomes, plus complementary surveys of account owners and parents, we provide the first large-scale analysis of CSA participation and effectiveness. We find that while CSA adoption has expanded to every ZIP code in Illinois, participation remains concentrated among higherincome, more educated families. Financial literacy emerges as a key barrier: 61% of parents who could save enough to cover half of future college costs still perceive their potential savings as meaningless. Among participants, higher savings are strongly correlated with better educational outcomes, including four-year college enrollment, attendance at selective institutions, and the pursuit of postgraduate degrees. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing financial literacy gaps and misperceptions about modest savings could significantly expand CSA effectiveness as a tool for educational equity. Beyond state-level 529 program optimization, our findings suggest several promising avenues for federal policy coordination and institutional innovation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4f0a\u5229\u8bfa\u4f0a\u5dde90\u4e07\u4e2a529\u8d26\u6237\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5927\u5b66\u50a8\u84c4\u8d26\u6237(CSA)\u5df2\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u4f46\u53c2\u4e0e\u4ecd\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u9ad8\u6559\u80b2\u5bb6\u5ead\u3002\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c61%\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u50a8\u84c4\u7684\u5bb6\u957f\u4ecd\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5c0f\u989d\u50a8\u84c4\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u9ad8\u50a8\u84c4\u4e0e\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6210\u679c\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u5347\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u6765\u6269\u5927\u6559\u80b2\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "research_question": "\u5927\u5b66\u50a8\u84c4\u8d26\u6237(CSA/529\u8ba1\u5212)\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5bb6\u5ead\u5bf9\u5927\u5b66\u50a8\u84c4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u6210\u672c\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8fc7\u901a\u80c0\uff0c\u516c\u5171\u8d44\u91d1\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5927\u5b66\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4f46CSA\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6548\u679c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u8d22\u52a1\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u50a8\u84c4\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u6210\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f0a\u5229\u8bfa\u4f0a\u5dde90\u4e07\u4e2a529\u8d26\u6237(2000-2023\u5e74)\u7684\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u94fe\u63a5\u6559\u80b2\u6210\u679c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u8d26\u6237\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u548c\u5bb6\u957f\u7684\u8865\u5145\u8c03\u67e5", "findings": "1) CSA\u53c2\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u9ad8\u6559\u80b2\u5bb6\u5ead\uff1b2) 61%\u6709\u50a8\u84c4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5bb6\u957f\u4ecd\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5c0f\u989d\u50a8\u84c4\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\uff1b3) \u66f4\u9ad8\u50a8\u84c4\u4e0e\u56db\u5e74\u5236\u5927\u5b66\u5165\u5b66\u3001\u540d\u6821\u5c31\u8bfb\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u5b66\u4f4d\u8ffd\u6c42\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u5728\u5bb6\u5ead\u5927\u5b66\u50a8\u84c4\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6536\u5165\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u969c\u788d\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u50a8\u84c4\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5dde\u7ea7529\u9879\u76ee\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u9488\u5bf9\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u653f\u7b56\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u521b\u65b0\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u80b2\u516c\u5e73"}}

Using data from 1996 to 2022, we find that the People's Bank of China (PBoC): (1) reacts to inflation gaps with slight asymmetry, featuring a no-intervention zone between-1% and 1%; (2) intervenes asymmetrically in output gaps, displaying stronger inclination toward averting overheating than downturns; (3) applies symmetric regulation to leverage gaps.

Many older individuals reduce their working hours, and in occupations with high part-time penalties, they tend to retire earlier, as observed in data from Japan and the United States. This study develops a general equilibrium model that incorporates occupational choices, endogenous labor supply, highlighting that the impact on the retirement decision is amplified by the presence of assets and pensions. Using the Japanese Panel Study of Employment Dynamics, I find that cutting employees\u2019 pension benefits reduce aggregate labor supply in occupations with high part-time penalties, reducing overall welfare across the economy. Furthermore, a commonly used policy measure\u2014extending the pension eligibility age\u2014is also found to decrease both output and welfare. In contrast, this paper suggests that increasing income tax credits and exempting pension benefits from income taxation can boost labor supply across all occupations.

While several economists have studied the potential costs associated with tax complexity, few have explored if complexity can also have beneficial effects. In a novel model where taxpayers can acquire costly knowledge to reduce their tax burden, we show that when elasticities of taxable income are heterogeneous, a complex tax system can act as a sorting device similar to second-degree price discrimination, where more elastic taxpayers will invest in more tax knowledge. We prove that if elasticities are increasing with income, introducing tax complexity can allow the government to raise higher tax revenues at no efficiency cost. However, we show that complexity primarily benefits the highest earners and thus exacerbates inequality. In the empirical section of our work, we study a complex tax system in Norway. Using rich register data on business owners, we demonstrate that many taxpayers make accounting decisions that cause them to pay higher taxes than would have been possible, and we quantify the exact size of this tax overpayment at the individual level. We show that overpayment tends to be larger for women, the less wealthy, and immigrants. We validate our model predictions by showing that failure to optimize is associated with a lower estimated tax elasticity."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7a0e\u653f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u7a0e\u653f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u4f46\u52a0\u5267\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u8fc7\u591a\u7f34\u7eb3\u7a0e\u6e29\u548c\u4f4e\u5f39\u6027\u7a0e\u6536\u4eba\u7fa4\u53d7\u5bb3\u6700\u5927\u3002", "research_question": "\u7a0e\u653f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u662f\u5426\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u79ef\u6781\u6548\u5e94\uff1f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0e\u6536\u6536\u5165\u548c\u5206\u914d\u6b63\u4e49\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f17\u591a\u7a0e\u6536\u7cfb\u7edf\u6781\u5176\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u6027\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a0e\u6536\u6548\u7387\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e8c\u7ea7\u4ef7\u683c\u533b\u5224\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7a0e\u8d39\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u6295\u8d44\u6210\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u7a0e\u8d1f\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u7a0e\u653f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5f39\u6027\u7a0e\u6536\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u7a0e\u653f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u7a0e\u6536\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u632a\u5a01\u5b9e\u9645\u6ce8\u518c\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e1a\u4e3b\u7684\u8d26\u52a1\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u7a0e\u8d1f\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "findings": "\u5f53\u5f39\u6027\u968f\u6536\u5165\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e0\u6548\u7387\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a0e\u6536\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u60e0\u53ca\u6700\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u8005\u5e76\u52a0\u5267\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5973\u6027\u3001\u8d44\u4ea7\u8f83\u5c11\u8005\u548c\u79fb\u6c11\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u591a\u7f34\u7eb3\u7a0e\u6b29\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5f39\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5c06\u7a0e\u653f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a0e\u653f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u914d\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8003\u8651\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5408\u7406\u7a0b\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Using a dynamic model that integrates demographic projections into the intertemporal government budget constraint, we show that ageing populations exert upward pressure on debt-to-GDP ratios by dampening output growth, weakening primary fiscal balances, and causing a negative differential between the rate of output growth and the average cost of financing the debt. While Germany and the Netherlands benefit from relatively favorable demographic fundamentals and disciplined fiscal policy, countries like Italy, Spain, France, and the US face increasing debt sustainability risks. Counterfactual simulations highlight that sustained migration inflows can significantly mitigate these risks by improving the age structure of the population, raising growth, and lowering fiscal deficits. These findings underscore the importance of demographic-aware fiscal frameworks and the role of migration policy as a tool for macroeconomic stabilization."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u524a\u5f31\u8d22\u653f\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6269\u5927\u589e\u957f\u5229\u7387\u5dee\uff0c\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6784\u6210\u957f\u671f\u538b\u529b\u3002\u5fb7\u56fd\u548c\u8377\u5170\u56e0\u6709\u5229\u4eba\u53e3\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8d22\u653f\u7eaa\u5f8b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u610f\u5927\u5229\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u3001\u6cd5\u56fd\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u9762\u4e34\u8f83\u5927\u503a\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u79fb\u6c11\u6d41\u5165\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u53e3\u5e74\u9f84\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u503a\u52a1\u538b\u529b\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u53e3\u8d8b\u52bf\u5982\u4f55\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u7f8e\u56fd\u53ca\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6b27\u6d32\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u4eba\u53e3\u654f\u611f\u578b\u8d22\u653f\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u671f\u653f\u5e9c\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u53e3\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u53e3\u9884\u6d4b\u7eb3\u5165\u653f\u5e9c\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u4ea7\u51fa\u589e\u957f\u3001\u524a\u5f31\u57fa\u672c\u8d22\u653f\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u9020\u6210\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u878d\u8d44\u6210\u672c\u8d1f\u5411\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a8\u9ad8\u503a\u52a1GDP\u5360\u6bd4\u3002\u79fb\u6c11\u6d41\u5165\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u53e3\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8d22\u653f\u8d64\u5b57\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u8de8\u671f\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u654f\u611f\u578b\u8d22\u653f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u79fb\u6c11\u653f\u7b56\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

As of today, the role of the state in providing favorable conditions for the promotion of high-tech products in foreign markets is growing significantly. At the same time, the role of the state is not so much in direct assistance to business entities (which is quite difficult given the financial situation of the state during the war), but in the use of other effective tools and institutions designed to stimulate production and export of high-tech products. At present, the Export Credit Agency of Ukraine is considered to be such an effective institution. In connection with the above, in order to learn from the positive experience, the article analyzes the formation of this institution in other countries and its positive impact on foreign trade of such states. According to the results of the analysis, the advantages of creating and properly organizing the activities of these Export Credit Agencies for the economy of a particular country as a whole and for individual businesses. Some aspects of modern legal regulation of the Export Credit Agency in Ukraine have been studied. In addition, the changes to the current legislation in the legal regulation of ESA activities, which were adopted during the martial law in Ukraine, are highlighted and analyzed, their impact on the real stimulation of exports of Ukrainian products is predicted. Given the special importance of Ukrainian exports during the war, as well as the need to increase the supply of high value-added products, proposals were made to improve the activities of the Export Credit Agency of Ukraine in terms of ensuring and stimulating exports of high-tech products."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6218\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u51fa\u53e3\u4fe1\u7528\u673a\u6784\uff08ECA\uff09\u523a\u6fc0\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u51fa\u53e3\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e4c\u514b\u5170ECA\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u5236\u73b0\u72b6\u3001\u6218\u65f6\u7acb\u6cd5\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u4ea7\u54c1\u51fa\u53e3\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u6218\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u51fa\u53e3\u4fe1\u7528\u673a\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u523a\u6fc0\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u51fa\u53e3\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6218\u65f6\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d22\u653f\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u9664\u76f4\u63a5\u63f4\u52a9\u5916\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u4ea7\u54c1\u51fa\u53e3\uff0cECA\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u673a\u6784\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u51fa\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u51fa\u53e3\u4fe1\u7528\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6218\u65f6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff08\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6ECA\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff08\u7814\u7a76\u4e4c\u514b\u5170ECA\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cd5\uff08\u5206\u6790\u6218\u65f6\u7acb\u6cd5\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u3002", "findings": "ECA\u662f\u523a\u6fc0\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u4ea7\u54c1\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u6218\u65f6\u7acb\u6cd5\u5bf9ECA\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdbECA\u8fd0\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u4ea7\u54c1\u51fa\u53e3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6218\u65f6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51fa\u53e3\u4fc3\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u51fa\u53e3\u4fe1\u7528\u673a\u6784\u5728\u7279\u6b8a\u65f6\u671f\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e4c\u514b\u5170ECA\u5728\u6218\u65f6\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u56fd\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u501f\u9274\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u4fc3\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Using the Brazilian Amazon as a laboratory, we examine the impact of a shock to environmental law enforcement capacity on banks' exposure to deforestation risks-an important yet understudied dimension of environmental risk.

These forecasts overlook a crucial fact: societies are not homogeneous. Using the Bisin-Verdier model of cultural transmission with endogenous direct socialization, calibrated to U.S. and global religion data, we identify an evolutionary counterforce. Subpopulations with persistently high fertility survive, expand their share, and push population-weighted fertility upward over time. Even if every country's aggregate total fertility rate (TFR) remains below replacement, the persistence of above-replacement groups makes extinction unlikely.

Special attention is paid to the NBU's delegated model of transferring certain central bank functions to commercial banks, the associated operational risks, the role of institutional trust, and practical tools for preserving the resilience of the monetary system."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4e2a\u4eba\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e4c\u514b\u51702004-2025\u5e74\u7ecf\u6d4e\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u521d\u671f\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u8f6c\u5411\u5b9e\u8df5\u5371\u673a\u73b0\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6218\u4e89\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u4e0b\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6218\u7565\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u53ca\u592e\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u59d4\u6258\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u7ecf\u6d4e\u601d\u60f3\u57282004-2025\u5e74\u671f\u95f4\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\uff1f\u6218\u4e89\u548f\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u4e0b\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6218\u7565\u600e\u6837\u8c03\u6574\uff1f\u592e\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u59d4\u6258\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548f\u8d27\u5e01\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u5de5\u5177\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f5c\u8005\u5728PrivatBank\u548f\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u592e\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u7ecf\u6d4e\u601d\u60f3\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6218\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6559\u8bad\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u533a\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u7ecf\u6d4e\u533a\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u6f5c\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5371\u673a\u73b0\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u59d4\u6258\u6a21\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u673a\u6784\u4fe1\u4efb\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d27\u5e01\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4eba\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728PrivatBank\u548f\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u592e\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548f\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u7ecf\u6d4e\u601d\u60f3\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u5411\u5b9e\u8df5\u5371\u673a\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5782\uff1b\u6218\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u592e\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u59d4\u6258\u6a21\u5f0f\u867d\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u98ce\u9669\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u8d27\u5e01\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u673a\u6784\u4fe1\u4efb\u662f\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6218\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u91d1\u878d\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u59d4\u6258\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u5185\u6db5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6218\u4e89\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548f\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4e3a\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u627f\u63a5\u592e\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u62a4\u8d27\u5e01\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While much has been written on harmful government use of FRT, little has been written regarding harmful private actor use. This Article helps fill a gap in the literature by providing a detailed analysis of the First Amendment interests at stake when private actors use FRT. Specifically, this Article analyzes whether laws that limit the use of publicly available photographs to create faceprints for inclusion in FRT databases violate the First Amendment rights of private actors.<br><br> In May 2025, a multidistrict litigation against Clearview AI, an FRT company, offered an opportunity to answer that question, but it settled. The court stated that the \u201csettlement agreement leaves unresolved the question that motivated this multidistrict litigation: whether the collection of publicly available biometric information for use by private or government entities . . . is reconcilable with constitutional privacy rights.\u201d This Article helps answer that unresolved question. But privacy is too narrow a framework. Constitutional rights of free speech, association and assembly are also affected.<br><br> This Article makes two claims, one descriptive and one normative. The descriptive claim is two-fold: (1) existing First Amendment law does not resolve the novel question of whether laws that limit how private actors use publicly available images violate their First Amendment rights, and (2) free speech advocates are divided on the proper response. The normative claim answers the unresolved question by concluding that some regulation of private actor use of publicly available images to create faceprints and FRT databases should be found constitutionally permissible.<br><br>Not only does this Article analyze the First Amendment arguments of FRT companies like Clearview AI, but it also introduces the other half of the story: the First Amendment interests of the faceprinted. After identifying problematic uses of FRT and showing the inadequacy of existing law, this Article makes the normative argument by engaging with three methods of constitutional interpretation, identifying First Amendment values that support regulating the use of FRT, and drawing lessons from Fourth Amendment doctrine and theory."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u79c1\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f(FRT)\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672a\u660e\u786e\u9650\u5236\u79c1\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u56fe\u50cf\u521b\u5efa\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u662f\u5426\u8fdd\u5baa\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u8be5\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u79c1\u4ebaFRT\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002", "research_question": "\u9650\u5236\u79c1\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7167\u7247\u521b\u5efa\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7528\u4e8eFRT\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u662f\u5426\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u6743\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u653f\u5e9c\u4f7f\u7528FRT\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u5df2\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u79c1\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u4f7f\u7528FRT\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14Clearview AI\u8bc9\u8bbc\u6848\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5baa\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u7ed3\u793e\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u96c6\u4f1a\u81ea\u7531\uff09\u3001\u5baa\u6cd5\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7b2c\u56db\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b66\u8bf4", "method": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u591a\u5730\u533a\u8bc9\u8bbc\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5baa\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u3001\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5145\u5206\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30", "findings": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b2c\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u9896\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u5021\u5bfc\u8005\u5bf9\u6b64\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\uff1b\u67d0\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79c1\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u56fe\u50cf\u521b\u5efaFRT\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5baa\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u79c1\u4ebaFRT\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\"\u88ab\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u8005\"\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u5229\u76ca\u89c6\u89d2\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u4e86FRT\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7acb\u6cd5\u8005\u548c\u6cd5\u9662\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u79c1\u4ebaFRT\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u4f3cClearview AI\u7684\u6848\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f9d\u636e\uff1b\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u5baa\u6cd5\u6743\u5229\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4"}}

Shocks to peer funds-identified solely through shared investor attention-predict subsequent returns and flows of focal funds, above and beyond the effects of overlapping stock holdings, style similarity, and textual similarity in fund prospectuses. Consistent with limited investor attention, these spillover effects are sluggish and amplified for connections that investors tend to overlook. Fund managers actively respond to negative spillovers by rebalancing portfolios away from attention-linked peers. In contrast, idiosyncratic peer shocks-such as key manager departures-generate positive inflows to attention-linked funds. The findings reveal an investor attention-based channel of shock propagation across institutional funds, with important implications for diversification across multiple fund managers and the stability of the sector."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u5171\u540c\u89c2\u770b\u884c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u6784\u57fa\u91d1\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u884c\u57fa\u91d1\u7684\u9707\u8361\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6e20\u9053\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u91d1\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\u6d41\u5165\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e14\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "research_question": "\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u89c2\u770b\u884c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u6784\u57fa\u91d1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9707\u8361\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\u6d41\u52a8\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9664\u4e86\u80a1\u7968\u6301\u4ed3\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u98ce\u683c\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u57fa\u91d1\u95f4\u8054\u7cfb\u6e20\u9053\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u91d1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6709\u9650\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u9707\u8361\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u5148\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5171\u540c\u89c2\u770b\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u6784\u57fa\u91d1\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u9a8c\u540c\u884c\u57fa\u91d1\u9707\u8361\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u91d1\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\u6d41\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u80a1\u7968\u6301\u4ed3\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "findings": "\u540c\u884c\u57fa\u91d1\u9707\u8361\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6e20\u9053\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u91d1\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\u6d41\u5165\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e14\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4e2d\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002\u57fa\u91d1\u7ecf\u7406\u4e3b\u52a8\u56de\u5e94\u8d1f\u9762\u6f0f\u6dbc\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u7279\u5b9a\u540c\u884c\u9707\u8361\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u9762\u8d44\u91d1\u6d41\u5165\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9707\u8361\u4f20\u64ad\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u591a\u5143\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u57fa\u91d1\u7ecf\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u9192\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u91d1\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u91d1\u878d\u884c\u4e1a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In our static model, the sign of the fertility effect depends solely on the intra-household wage gap: when fathers earn more than mothers, stricter leave reduces fertility by diverting high-wage labor from the market; when mothers earn more, the reverse holds. When paternal and maternal wages are equal, the model predicts a neutrality: reallocating childcare between parents leaves total household labor income unchanged, so paternity leave alters only the intrahousehold division of time and not the opportunity cost of children. This implies that eliminating the gender wage gap would remove any direct fertility impact of paternity leave-meaning that such policies are more effective when a wage gap exists. A two-period extension shows that insufficient subsidies amplify the negative effect in high-paternal-wage households, while the dynamic model reveals that stricter leave can delay births by lowering the marginal utility of current childbearing in anticipation of future time constraints. Comparative statics from the static, two-period, and dynamic models further reveal a fiscal trade-off: when paternity-leave mandates reduce fertility in high-paternal-wage households, larger subsidies are required to maintain a given fertility target, but childcare subsidies and flexible work can soften this trade-off. An extended static model incorporating childcare subsidies and flexible work arrangements demonstrates that combining paternity leave with both instruments mitigates negative effects in high-paternal-wage households and supports stable fertility while advancing equity objectives. In economies with persistent wage gaps, such a policy portfolio is particularly effective; under full wage equality, paternity leave is demographically neutral unless paired with flexible work, in which case it can increase fertility even without a wage gap."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5bb6\u5ead\u751f\u80b2\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u5bf9\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bb6\u5ead\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1a\u5f53\u7236\u4eb2\u5de5\u8d44\u66f4\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u80b2\u7387\uff1b\u5f53\u6bcd\u4eb2\u5de5\u8d44\u66f4\u9ad8\u65f6\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\uff1b\u5de5\u8d44\u76f8\u7b49\u65f6\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u6027\u3002\u6d88\u9664\u6027\u522b\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f1a\u4f7f\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u5931\u53bb\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u80b2\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "research_question": "\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5bb6\u5ead\u751f\u80b2\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f\u5176\u6548\u679c\u5982\u4f55\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bb6\u5ead\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bb6\u5ead\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e24\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u751f\u80b2\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e24\u671f\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "1\uff09\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u5bf9\u751f\u80b2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bb6\u5ead\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\u65b9\u5411\uff1b2\uff09\u5de5\u8d44\u76f8\u7b49\u65f6\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u8865\u8d34\u4e0d\u8db3\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9ad8\u7236\u4eb2\u5de5\u8d44\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\uff1b4\uff09\u4e25\u683c\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u671f\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u751f\u80b2\uff1b5\uff09\u653f\u7b56\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u966a\u4ea7\u5047+\u8865\u8d34+\u7075\u6d3b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff09\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u653f\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\uff1a\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5de5\u8d44\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u9700\u8981\u4e0e childcare\u8865\u8d34\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b89\u6392\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u624d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u80b2\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\uff1b\u5728\u5de5\u8d44\u5e73\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u966a\u4ea7\u5047\u9700\u8981\u914d\u5408\u7075\u6d3b\u5de5\u4f5c\u624d\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u3002"}}

The model, identified as GVAR-IIS, uses a global vector autoregressive methodology that deals with the curse of dimensionality augmented with Impulse-Indicator Saturation dummies to account for structural breaks. The model is tested in empirical research focusing on the Brazilian labour market. In the empirical analysis, the GVAR-IIS model is compared against several other forecasting models such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), as well as the classical GVAR. Forecasts are compared using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics, and a Model Confidence Set (MCS) is computed. The study finds that the GVAR-IIS model is present on the final MCS, and that the IIS procedure can capture the shocks. In conclusion, the study suggests that the GVAR-IIS methodology can provide parsimonious forecasting models taking into account the dynamics of the region's employment and deal, not only with the curse of dimensionality in a manageable form but also deals with structural breaks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faGVAR-IIS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u6307\u793a\u9971\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5df4\u897f\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52(GVAR)\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8109\u51b2\u6307\u793a\u9971\u548c(IIS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GVAR-IIS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Impulse-Indicator Saturation\u865a\u62df\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RMSE\u3001MAE\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6(MCS)\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b(PCA\u3001VECM\u3001\u7ecf\u5178GVAR)\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "GVAR-IIS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cIIS\u7a0b\u5e8f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc5\u5492\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GVAR-IIS\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86GVAR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7b49\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

On average, women receive payouts from discrimination litigation that are about 16% higher than payouts received by men even when controlling for geography, industry, employer, filer, and discrimination characteristics. Women\u2019s cases remain open significantly longer than men\u2019s with similar demographic, case and employer characteristics; we argue that this is due to women\u2019s cases complexity and severity. In addition, we provide extensive statistics about workplace discrimination in U.S. organizations, underscoring the need to account for intersectionality and case complexity when measuring discrimination severity. We also show how our discrimination severity metric can be extended to a race-based or age-based payout gap. Lastly, we document that discrimination severity concentrates in firms with weaker corporate culture, firms with more male independent directors, firms with more men on the board\u2019s subcommittees, less profitable firms and firms with higher financial distress.&nbsp;</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u804c\u573a\u6b67\u89c6\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u2014\u2014\u7f8e\u56fd\u5e73\u7b49\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a(EEOC)\u6b67\u89c6\u7533\u8bc9\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u8d54\u4ed8\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5973\u6027\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u8bc9\u8bbc\u8d54\u4ed8\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u7537\u6027\u9ad816%\uff0c\u4e14\u5973\u6027\u6848\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5973\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u6b67\u89c6\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u5316\u8f83\u5f31\u3001\u7537\u6027\u72ec\u7acb\u8463\u4e8b\u8f83\u591a\u3001\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u4e0b\u5c5e\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7537\u6027\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8f83\u9ad8\u3001\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u56f0\u5883\u8f83\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u804c\u573a\u6b67\u89c6\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1f\u6027\u522b\u5728\u6b67\u89c6\u8bc9\u8bbc\u8d54\u4ed8\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u804c\u573a\u6b67\u89c6\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b67\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u6b67\u89c6\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EEOC\u7533\u8bc9\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6b67\u89c6\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6848\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u8d54\u4ed8\u91d1\u989d\u548c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u957f\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7f8e\u56fdEEOC\u6b67\u89c6\u7533\u8bc9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u63a7\u5236\u5730\u7406\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u3001\u96c7\u4e3b\u3001\u7533\u8bc9\u4eba\u548c\u6b67\u89c6\u7279\u5f81\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6027\u522b\u8d54\u4ed8\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u6848\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u957f\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "findings": "\u5973\u6027\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u8d54\u4ed8\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u7537\u6027\u9ad816%\uff1b\u5973\u6027\u6848\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u957f\uff1b\u6b67\u89c6\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u5316\u5f31\u3001\u7537\u6027\u8463\u4e8b\u591a\u3001\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d54\u4ed8\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6027\u522b\u6b67\u89c6\u6848\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u6027\u548c\u6848\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5728\u6b67\u89c6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u6539\u5584\u804c\u573a\u6587\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff1b\u4e3a\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u7ef4\u6743\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

We consider mobility as movement captured by changes in status between parents and children. We provide estimates of overall mobility, which involves mobility during transition to a system's steady state, as well as steady state mobility, which captures long-run mobility independent of transitional dynamics or shifts in the marginal distribution of outcomes across generations. We further decompose overall mobility into structural and exchange components. We find that China exhibits more overall educational mobility than Russia mostly due to greater structural mobility, while Russia exhibits greater steady state educational mobility. In contrast, both the overall and steady state occupational mobility is similar in China and Russia. Comparing these results to the US, we find that steady state mobility in education is substantially higher in the US and Russia compared to China, but occupational steady state mobility is comparable in all three countries."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5728\u8f6c\u578b\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7a33\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e24\u56fd\u804c\u4e1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u7a33\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6700\u9ad8", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5728\u4ece\u8ba1\u5212\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5411\u5e02\u573a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6709\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u793e\u4f1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5f02\u540c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8f6c\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u5f81", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u7a33\u6001\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6e21\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u533a\u5206", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u9010\u4ee3\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u5206\u89e3", "findings": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u603b\u4f53\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\uff09\uff0c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7a33\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e24\u56fd\u804c\u4e1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u7a33\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6700\u9ad8", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f6c\u578b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4ee3\u9645\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4fc4\u4e24\u56fd\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u8f6c\u578b\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u793e\u4f1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236"}}

Our methodology is versatile, encompassing alternatives such as factor models with nonlinear factor structures, conditional factor models, and factor models with structural breaks. We first establish the asymptotic properties of a so-called fixed bandwidth-based test, showing its asymptotic normality and power against local alternatives. To enhance the size and power properties while addressing the practical limitations of the fixed bandwidth approach, we propose an adaptive test and establish its asymptotic size correctness and consistency. Simulation studies demonstrate its superior size and power. We further illustrate the practical relevance of our test by applying it to three empirical studies concerning real and financial variables in the global economy."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u914d\u6027\u6b8a\u4f59\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u9a8c\u9759\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u7b49\u66ff\u4ee3\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u529f\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u9a8c\u9759\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u672a\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e38\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u9a8c\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9002\u914d\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e26\u5bbd\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u529f\u6548\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u914d\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5927\u5c0f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "findings": "\u9002\u914d\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u529f\u6548\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d"}}

However, this was not possible for India, a large emerging economy with a significant population undergoing demographic transition, due to a paucity of data. We use the new dataset Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)-Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) and use a panel to create Labour Flow Charts and Transition Matrices for India from January 2019 to December 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these were created for India. We then use that to look at the impact of Covid-19 on the Indian labour market. We not only look at transitions between employment, unemployment and out of labour force, but also across types of employment-full-time and part-time. The rich data also allows us to consider heterogeneity in the labour market and look at the differential impact of the pandemic across different education groups and gender. From the labour flow charts and transition probabilities, we find that while all groups have been impacted, the magnitude of the impact is different across groups. The recovery is also uneven, and the extent depends on education levels. Further, we do an event study analysis to examine the likelihood of getting a full-time job across different educational and gender groups. Men, on average, enjoy a higher likelihood of getting a full-time job than women. The likelihood coefficients also go up with increasing educational qualifications. Looking at skill heterogeneity, while the likelihood of getting a full-time job either goes down for most groups during the pandemic or the change is minuscule, strikingly it goes up for those with no education, for both men and women. The likelihood coefficients remain elevated for men even after the restrictions are removed, and that for women reverts to the level seen before the pandemic. Finally, this paper provides a way to continuously monitor the dynamics of the labour market as data is released in the regular intervals in the future, which would be of great value for researchers and policymakers alike."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528CMIE-CPHS\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86COVID-19\u5bf9\u5370\u5ea6\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "research_question": "COVID-19\u75ab\u60c5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5370\u5ea6\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff1f\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u53e3\u5927\u56fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9a\u671f\u9ad8\u9891\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ca\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728COVID-19\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5c31\u4e1a\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5c31\u4e1a\u3001\u5931\u4e1a\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CMIE-CPHS\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u521b\u5efa\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\uff082019\u5e741\u6708\u81f32021\u5e7412\u6708\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u804c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u6240\u6709\u7fa4\u4f53\u90fd\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u54cd\u4f46\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u6062\u590d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u4e14\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u7537\u6027\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u804c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5973\u6027\uff1b\u65e0\u6559\u80b2\u80cc\u666f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u804c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53cd\u800c\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u521b\u5efa\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

Using novel data on fund viewership, we are the first to examine how these investors allocate attention to specific institutional funds.

However, their energy performance under varying environmental and mission conditions remains underexplored. This study presents a simulation-based analysis of multirotor UAV energy consumption using the PX4-Gazebo platform, calibrated with real-world flight data. Three UAV models-Iris, Typhoon H480 and Octocopter-were evaluated across a range of payloads (0.1-5 kg), cruise speeds (2-16 m/s) and environmental factors, including wind, temperature and humidity. Results revealed consistent U-shaped energy-speed curves, with optimal cruise speeds ranging from 8 to 10 m/s, depending on the payload and platform. Environmental factors such as headwinds and low temperatures increased energy consumption by up to 25%. Validation against field telemetry showed mean absolute percentage errors below 11%.

This paper examines how banks adjust their loan pricing when firms have a higher share of passive index fund investors as shareholders. Using syndicated loan data, we find that loan spreads increase with passive ownership, and provide evidence consistent with higher loan spreads reflecting increased risk due to reduced shareholder oversight. Supporting this interpretation, we find stronger effects among well-governed and informationally opaque firms, where shareholder oversight is more impactful. However, the increase in loan spreads is not fully accounted for by changes in traditional measures of firm risk. Suggestive evidence points towards banks increasing their monitoring intensity in response to changes in shareholder composition, which is costly and reflected in loan spreads."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u88ab\u52a8\u6307\u6570\u57fa\u91d1\u6301\u80a1\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u94f6\u884c\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u5dee\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u80a1\u4e1c\u76d1\u7763\u51cf\u5c11\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u4fe1\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u4f1a\u52a0\u5f3a\u76d1\u63a7\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "research_question": "\u5f53\u4f01\u4e1a\u88ab\u52a8\u6307\u6570\u57fa\u91d1\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6301\u80a1\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u6574\u8d37\u6b3e\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u6307\u6570\u57fa\u91d1\u5728\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u4e2d\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u80a1\u6743\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7591\u95ee\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4fe1\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u88ab\u52a8\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u80a1\u4e1c\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u94f6\u56e2\u8d37\u6b3e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u88ab\u52a8\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4e0e\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u5dee\u968f\u88ab\u52a8\u6240\u6709\u6743\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u6cbb\u7406\u826f\u597d\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u4e2d\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5229\u5dee\u4e0a\u5347\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u56e0\u80a1\u4e1c\u76d1\u7763\u51cf\u5c11\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u88ab\u52a8\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80a1\u4e1c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u4fe1\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u94f6\u884c\u4fe1\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u88ab\u52a8\u6295\u8d44\u8d8b\u52bf\u5bf9\u4fe1\u8d37\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We distinguish between supply-driven and demand-driven oil shocks and show that firms respond asymmetrically. Supply shocks, which heighten uncertainty and input cost volatility, lead firms to accelerate YCC as a precautionary measure to preserve liquidity. In contrast, demand shocks, which signal economic expansion, prompt firms to reduce YCC by extending credit terms to support growth and strengthen customer relationships. Using a large panel of U.S. public firms from 1987 to 2023, we find these effects are economically significant and more pronounced among financially constrained firms, those operating in low transparency and highly competitive environments, as well as firms with direct oil exposure. Our findings reveal a novel operational channel through which macroeconomic disturbances shape corporate behavior, offering new insights into how firms tactically manage liquidity and financial flexibility in response to external shocks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ef7\u683c\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e74\u7ec8\u73b0\u91d1\u56de\u6536\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u4f9b\u5e94\u51b2\u51fb\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4f01\u4e1a\u52a0\u901f\u56de\u6536\u73b0\u91d1\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u51fb\u5219\u8ba9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5ef6\u957f\u4fe1\u7528\u671f\u9650\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u589e\u957f\u3002", "research_question": "\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ef7\u683c\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e74\u7ec8\u73b0\u91d1\u56de\u6536\u7b56\u7565\uff1f\u4f9b\u5e94\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77f3\u6cb9\u51b2\u51fb\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b2\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u8425\u6e20\u9053\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u9632\u6027\u52a8\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4f9b\u5e94\u51b2\u51fb\uff08\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u51fb\uff08\u9884\u793a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6269\u5f20\uff09\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u73b0\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281987-2023\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4f9b\u5e94\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ef7\u683c\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e74\u7ec8\u73b0\u91d1\u56de\u6536\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u4f9b\u5e94\u51b2\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f01\u4e1a\u52a0\u901f\u73b0\u91d1\u56de\u6536\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u51fb\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4f01\u4e1a\u51cf\u5c11\u73b0\u91d1\u56de\u6536\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u8d22\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f01\u4e1a\u3001\u4f4e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u3001\u9ad8\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u77f3\u6cb9\u66b4\u9732\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b2\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u8425\u6e20\u9053\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u51b2\u51fb\u5e94\u5bf9\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ef7\u683c\u51b2\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8d22\u52a1\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

While a significant body of research explores the structural determinants of environmental behavior, the psychological mechanisms, particularly those linked to social identity, remain less understood. This research addresses this gap by examining whether activating a poverty identity influences how individuals attribute environmental responsibility. We conducted lab-in-Field experiments in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, with 138 participants randomly assigned to either a poverty identity priming condition or a neutral control group. Following the priming task, we measured environmental moral disengagement using a newly developed scale. Our exploratory factor analysis identified two primary dimensions of disengagement: (1) externalizing blame (\"Not my fault\") and (2) anthropocentric prioritization (\"Human First (only)\"). The results show that priming poverty identity had a large and statistically significant positive effect on the \"Not my fault\" dimension (\u03b2 = 3.747, p &lt; 0.01), indicating that participants were more likely to attribute responsibility for environmental problems to external actors like governments and wealthy nations. This effect was particularly pronounced among younger participants. Conversely, the treatment had a small, negative, and marginally significant effect on the \"Human First (only)\" dimension (\u03b2 =-0.256, p &lt; 0.1). These findings suggest that activating a poverty identity can causally increase specific forms of environmental moral disengagement, highlighting an important psychological barrier that may prevent pro-environmental action in disadvantaged populations. The study underscores the need for environmental campaigns and policies to consider the influence of identity-related cognitive frames."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d2b\u56f0\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u73af\u5883\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u8131\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\"\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u7684\u9519\"\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\"\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f18\u5148\"\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u5bf9\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u969c\u788d\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u8d2b\u56f0\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u73af\u5883\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u8131\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u73af\u5883\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u73af\u5883\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u8131\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5728\u521a\u679c\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u6208\u9a6c\u5e02\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c138\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u5230\u8d2b\u56f0\u8eab\u4efd\u542f\u52a8\u7ec4\u6216\u4e2d\u6027\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u8131\u91cf\u8868\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "findings": "\u8d2b\u56f0\u8eab\u4efd\u542f\u52a8\u5bf9\"\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u7684\u9519\"\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd(\u03b2=3.747,p<0.01)\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u95ee\u9898\u8d23\u4efb\u5f52\u548e\u4e8e\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u5bcc\u88d5\u56fd\u5bb6\uff1b\u5bf9\"\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f18\u5148\"\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6709\u5fae\u5f31\u8d1f\u5411\u5f71\u54cd(\u03b2=-0.256,p<0.1)\uff1b\u5e74\u8f7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u8131\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u73af\u5883\u884c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u8eab\u4efd\u76f8\u5173\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u73af\u4fdd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

The research uses data from the top five banks in 15 countries from 2010 to 2024. It combines information about how well each bank is doing with data about the country's overall economy and global financial stress. The study uses special statistical methods like fixed effects and random effects models, along with checks to make sure the results are reliable. One important part of the study is the Global Financial Stress Index (GFSI), which is made by looking at several stress markers like how much countries owe, how unstable markets are, and how much it costs to get money. The GFSI helps show how financial stress spreads around the world. The study expects to find that good economic growth, keeping inflation under control, and careful money policies help banks stay strong. But having too much debt, sudden changes in policies, and high global stress levels can make banks less stable. This research connects how individual banks perform with the bigger picture of financial stability and global conditions. It offers real data and useful ideas for people who make financial rules and decisions. The results aim to help those in charge of banks and financial policies understand what keeps or harms financial stability, especially in countries that are more at risk in the global financial system."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u653f\u5e9c\u89c4\u5b9a\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u5927\u578b\u94f6\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u538b\u529b\u6307\u6570\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u63ed\u793a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u653f\u5e9c\u89c4\u5b9a\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u538b\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u5927\u578b\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u51fb\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5fae\u89c2\u5b8f\u89c2\u8054\u52a8\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u4f7f\u752815\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u524d\u4e94\u5927\u94f6\u884c2010-2024\u5e74\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u538b\u529b\u6307\u6570(GFSI)\u5305\u542b\u503a\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u878d\u8d44\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u6307\u6807", "findings": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u4f4e\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u8c28\u614e\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u6709\u52a9\u94f6\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u503a\u52a1\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5168\u7403\u538b\u529b\u4f1a\u5a31\u5bb3\u94f6\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "theory_contributions": "\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u538b\u529b\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fae\u89c2\u5b8f\u89c2\u8054\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6491", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u94f6\u884c\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027"}}

A descriptive survey research design was employed, and data were collected through a structured questionnaire. The study population consisted of 6,557 teachers across 302 public senior secondary schools in the state. A sample of 700 respondents comprising 60 principals and 640 teachers was selected using simple and stratified random sampling techniques. The reliability of the instrument was established using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC), while face and content validity were confirmed by experts in Educational Management and Educational Technology. Data were analyzed using mean and standard deviation. Findings revealed that while some ICT tools were available in the schools, their integration into classroom teaching was generally low, with over 80 percent of the mean usage scores falling below the criterion mean of 2.5 on a 5-point scale. Although teachers demonstrated moderate to high ICT proficiency, they lacked the institutional support, regular training opportunities, and enabling infrastructure necessary for consistent application in pedagogical practice. Key challenges identified included erratic power supply, poor internet connectivity, limited availability of ICT tools, and the absence of technical support personnel. Based on these findings, the study recommended that the government intensify the implementation of the National ICT-in-Education Policy by equipping schools with adequate infrastructure, ensuring ongoing teacher professional development, and providing dedicated technical support systems. These measures are essential for fostering sustainable and effective technology integration in public senior secondary schools across Rivers State."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u6cb3\u6d41\u5dde\u516c\u7acb\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u90e8\u5206ICT\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u8bfe\u5802\u6574\u5408\u6c34\u5e73\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0880%\u4f7f\u7528\u5f97\u5206\u4f4e\u4e8e2.5/5\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u529b\u4f9b\u5e94\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u5dee\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "research_question": "\u6cb3\u6d41\u5dde\u516c\u7acb\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u5b58\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fd\u5bb6ICT\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u516c\u7acb\u9ad8\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u969c\u788d\u4ee5\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u4e13\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u6559\u5e08\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u4ece302\u6240\u5b66\u68216557\u540d\u6559\u5e08\u4e2d\u62bd\u6837700\u4eba\uff0860\u540d\u6821\u957f+640\u540d\u6559\u5e08\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Pearson\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5747\u503c\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "ICT\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u7528\u4f46\u8bfe\u5802\u6574\u5408\u7387\u4f4e\uff0880%\u4f7f\u7528\u5f97\u5206<2.5/5\uff09\uff0c\u6559\u5e08ICT\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u7b49\u504f\u4e0a\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5236\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7535\u529b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5dee\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u6709\u9650\u3001\u65e0\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u5458\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u7684\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u5e9c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\u52a0\u5f3a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u914d\u5907\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u6559\u5e08\u6301\u7eed\u4e13\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u5efa\u7acb\u4e13\u4e1a\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

We explore this question in the context of U.S. federal rulemaking, leveraging a novel dataset that tracks 15,000 rulemakers responsible for drafting and advancing 38,000 regulatory projects. We find that teams including women deliberate longer and extensively revise their initial drafts, yet are ultimately less likely to see their projects approved by the agency leadership and issued as final rules. To explain these patterns, we develop a simple model of rulemaking in which output gaps arise from four sources: selection (women are assigned lower-quality projects), cost (differences in the cost of exerting effort), incentive (differences in the return to effort), and evaluation (differential treatment by agency leadership). Reduced-form estimates, aided by a machine-learning C-BERT model, reveal that women are assigned to lower-quality projects and face harsher evaluations, but receive stronger incentives tied to project completion. Structural estimates confirm that disadvantages in selection, cost, and evaluation each contribute meaningfully to the observed gender gap, partially offset by females receiving stronger incentives. Our findings shed light on how female representation shapes regulatory performance and contribute to the broader debate over whether diversity enhances or hinders the effectiveness of public institutions.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5973\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u56e2\u961f\u5ba1\u8bae\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u4fee\u6539\u66f4\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u9879\u76ee\u83b7\u6279\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u9879\u76ee\u5206\u914d\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u52aa\u529b\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u88ab\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b8c\u6210\u6fc0\u52b1\u6240\u62b5\u6d88\u3002", "research_question": "\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5973\u6027\u4ee3\u8868\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u4e89\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4ea7\u51fa\u5dee\u8ddd\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u56db\u4e2a\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u9879\u76ee\u5206\u914d\uff09\u3001\u6210\u672c\uff08\u52aa\u529b\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\uff08\u52aa\u529b\u56de\u62a5\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u9886\u5bfc\u5c42\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u5f85\uff09", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5305\u542b15,000\u540d\u89c4\u5219\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c38,000\u4e2a\u76d1\u7ba1\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60C-BERT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f30\u8ba1", "findings": "\u5973\u6027\u56e2\u961f\u5ba1\u8bae\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u4fee\u6539\u66f4\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u9879\u76ee\u83b7\u6279\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u5973\u6027\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u5230\u8d28\u91cf\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4e14\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u4e25\u5389\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b8c\u6210\u6fc0\u52b1", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u76d1\u7ba1\u4ea7\u51fa\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u56db\u56e0\u7d20\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e", "practical_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u5973\u6027\u5728\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u6784\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u653f\u7b56\u542f\u793a"}}

This review examines the potential for an \"add-to-cart\" model that could transform biologics development from custom, institution-specific processes to standardized, accessible approaches, which is analogous to e-commerce. The add-to-cart model was proposed as a paradigm that enables researchers to specify therapeutic requirements through standardized interfaces and access pre-optimized biological candidates from integrated databases or platforms. This model could potentially improve utility, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, speed, exploration capabilities, and applicability compared to traditional methods. This paper reports areas and inefficiencies in the current development landscapes that could be addressed, while historical precedents from plasmid registries, semiconductor manufacturing, software development, and automotive industries illustrate transformation patterns that could inform this add-to-cart future of biologics development. Key enablers include large-scale biological databases, AI-powered design engines, automated synthesis platforms, standardized interfaces, and appropriate regulatory frameworks. Implementation could fundamentally alter biologics development from bench to bedside, democratizing therapeutic innovation while maintaining scientific rigor. The convergence of computational capabilities, biological databases, and infrastructure development creates conditions for the emergence of the model. Collectively, systematic approaches to biologics development may represent an inevitable evolution toward an add-to-cart approach, providing more efficient and accessible therapeutic innovation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u52a0\u5165\u8d2d\u7269\u8f66\"\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u4ece\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u9884\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5019\u9009\u5e93\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\"\u52a0\u5165\u8d2d\u7269\u8f66\"\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8131\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u884c\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u957f\u3001\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u65ad\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8131\u8282\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u501f\u9274\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7684\"\u52a0\u5165\u8d2d\u7269\u8f66\"\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u6c7d\u8f66\u5de5\u4e1a\u7b49\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8f6c\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u5148\u4f8b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u501f\u9274\u7684\u8f6c\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "findings": "\"\u52a0\u5165\u8d2d\u7269\u8f66\"\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u9884\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5019\u9009\u5e93\u3001AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f15\u64ce\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\"\u52a0\u5165\u8d2d\u7269\u8f66\"\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u4ece\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5411\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5efa\u8bbe\u3001AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u53f0\u6784\u5efa\u7b49\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u521b\u65b0\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

These industries are characterized by intensive, high-risk, and extraordinarily expensive Research and Development (R&amp;D) cycles. We argue that IPR, with patents at the forefront, provides the indispensable incentive structure required to justify such massive investments. The analysis explores the central role of patents in granting a temporary monopoly that allows for the recoupment of R&amp;D costs and the funding of future projects. Furthermore, the article examines the crucial supporting roles of other IPR forms, including trademarks for brand integrity and patient safety, trade secrets for protecting proprietary processes, and copyright for safeguarding published research and documentation.

It fundamentally transformed the postwar trading system, which had been primarily focused on goods, by creating the World Trade Organization (WTO) and introducing binding rules for services and intellectual property.1 This paper analyzes the genesis and structure of two of the Round's most significant outcomes: the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). It argues that these agreements signified a paradigm shift, moving global trade governance from a narrow focus on tariffs and border measures to a broader regulatory framework that addresses the \"behind-the-border\" policies central to the modern knowledge-and service-based economy. The paper examines the core principles, structure, and strategic implications of TRIPS and GATS, highlighting the political and economic forces that shaped them and their enduring impact on international trade, development, and national sovereignty."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e4c\u62c9\u572d\u56de\u5408\uff081986-1994\uff09\u662f\u56fd\u9645\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u6c34\u5cad\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86WTO\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86TRIPS\u548cGATS\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5168\u7403\u8d38\u6613\u6cbb\u7406\u4ece\u5173\u7a0e\u548c\u8fb9\u5883\u63aa\u65bd\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u73b0\u4ee3\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u56fd\u5185\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "research_question": "\u5206\u6790\u4e4c\u62c9\u572d\u56de\u5408\u4e2dTRIPS\u548cGATS\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u8d38\u6613\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u610f\u4e49", "motivation": "\u4e4c\u62c9\u572d\u56de\u5408\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6218\u540e\u8d38\u6613\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3TRIPS\u548cGATS\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u6210\u679c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f71\u54cd", "theoretical_framework": "\u56fd\u9645\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6cd5\u3001\u8d38\u6613\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u534f\u8bae\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u53d1\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u529b\u91cf\u5206\u6790", "findings": "TRIPS\u548cGATS\u534f\u8bae\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4ece\u8fb9\u5883\u63aa\u65bd\u5230\u56fd\u5185\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5851\u9020\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5168\u7403\u89c4\u5219\u6846\u67b6", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u8d38\u6613\u6cbb\u7406\u4ece\u8fb9\u5883\u63aa\u65bd\u5230\u56fd\u5185\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3WTO\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d38\u6613\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c"}}

However, these subsidies impose a significant fiscal burden on governments, while having limited impact on adoption rates. A key concern among early adopters is the need for adequate infrastructure services, especially charging infrastructure given the range anxiety. This paper analyzes the findings of a comprehensive primary survey that we conducted for this study and examines the impact of alternative incentive policies on consumer preferences for electric vehicles, and evaluates the effects of substituting these incentives for direct purchase subsidies. Our findings suggest that policymakers should prioritize incorporating recurring value-added benefits in addition to direct subsidies. Such incentives would help reduce longterm operational costs and offer a sustainable transition to low-carbon mobility."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u76f4\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u8865\u8d34\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u589e\u52a0\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u589e\u503c\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u4f4e\u78b3\u51fa\u884c\u8f6c\u578b\u3002", "research_question": "\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u6fc0\u52b1\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3\u76f4\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u8865\u8d34\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u8865\u8d34\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u9020\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u8d22\u653f\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u63a8\u52a8\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u666e\u53ca\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u65e9\u671f\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5145\u7535\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u504f\u597d\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u653f\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u8c03\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u8865\u8d34\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u589e\u52a0\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u589e\u503c\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6fc0\u52b1\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u6fc0\u52b1\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u589e\u503c\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u63a5\u8865\u8d34\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u5e9c\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u666e\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u964d\u4f4e\u653f\u5e9c\u8d22\u653f\u538b\u529b\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4f4e\u78b3\u51fa\u884c\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

The methodology used in the paper allows us to identify outliers and evaluate how changes in the oil price affect gasoline and alcohol prices in different regions, and their lags and allows gains in terms of forecast accuracy."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528GVAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u6307\u6807\u9971\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u5df4\u897f\u6c7d\u6cb9\u548c\u9152\u7cbe\u4ef7\u683c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6cb9\u4ef7\u51b2\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5e02\u573a\u6e20\u9053\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u9152\u7cbe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u71c3\u6599\u5f71\u54cd\u4ef7\u683c\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236", "research_question": "\u6cb9\u4ef7\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u6e20\u9053\u5f71\u54cd\u5df4\u897f\u6c7d\u6cb9\u548c\u9152\u7cbe\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u65f6\u6ede\u6548\u5e94", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u77f3\u6cb9\u5e02\u573a\u51b2\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6e20\u9053\u5e02\u573a\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u6c7d\u6cb9\u6700\u7ec8\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u5df4\u897f\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u71c3\u6599\u6c7d\u8f66\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9152\u7cbe\u4f9b\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u71c3\u6599\u4ef7\u683c\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u6848\u4f8b", "theoretical_framework": "\u5168\u7403\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52(GVAR)\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8109\u51b2\u6307\u6807\u9971\u548c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u533a\u57df\u71c3\u6599\u4ef7\u683c\u8054\u52a8\u5173\u7cfb", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u7684GVAR\u5168\u7403VAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u6307\u6807\u9971\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6cb9\u4ef7\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u6c7d\u6cb9\u548c\u9152\u7cbe\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u6ede", "findings": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4ef7\u683c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cb9\u4ef7\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u6c7d\u6cb9\u548c\u9152\u7cbe\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u65f6\u6ede\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u83b7\u5f97\u589e\u76ca", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86GVAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u71c3\u6599\u4ef7\u683c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8109\u51b2\u6307\u6807\u9971\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u533a\u57df\u4ef7\u683c\u8054\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5df4\u897f\u71c3\u6599\u5e02\u573a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u6cb9\u4ef7\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u71c3\u6599\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

The gender pay gap is defined as the distinct average gap in earnings between men and women in the labour market, usually represented as the percentage difference between the median or mean hourly wages of male and female employees.

These bonds were designed with very specific cashflows for the respective goals. They combined accumulation, decumulation, inflation and compounding in a single instrument to overcome the typical financial literacy challenges/behavioral biases faced by average investors globally. These bonds, purchased voluntarily, on a simple two-question app, have been successful and are being considered by other countries in the developed and developing world as they address key social challenges. The only two questions to be answered are: (a) start date of targeted cashflows (e.g., one's retirement date or when a child would enter college); and (b) target real amount desired (e.g., R$ 5,000 per month) from such investments, with the idea being that ALL investors, of all levels of financial literacy and income levels can answer such questions. These instruments were issued with various start dates of payments to cater to different age cohorts to target their respective goal-cash flow needs.\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n <p><span>Brazil\u2019s Tesouro Nacional (NT) has kept very detailed records of the age of investors in the respective instruments and distributional data (along with gender, region of purchase etc.). One of the intriguing elements from an analysis of the data is that there is a mismatch between what specific instrument the app on NT\u2019s website would recommend to investors based on their target retirement date or child\u2019s date of college entrance (call it \u201cguided choice\u201d or \u201cnudge\u201d), and the actual age/date distribution of investors based on data over the last 1.5-2 years. The unanswered research questions we are pursuing is whether the app is not entirely effective in educating/guiding/nudging investors, or whether investors are displaying rational behavior, exhibiting some form of behavioral bias, or are purely speculating (given that these are very long-duration bonds and hence offer oversized returns if say the investor goes long duration of 50 years and interest rates drop 1% in a short span of time), or some combination of the above. There are six puzzles that we examine within this data set, including why young people are buying bonds targeted to older investors? why older investors appear to be more risk averse and select bonds that are the guided choice? why we get unusual distributions by age in the education bond etc.? We examine the data for all start dates of each of Renda+ (8 instruments with start dates of 2030, 2035\u2026.2065) and Educa+ (17 instruments with start dates of 2025, 2026,\u2026.2041), and try to discern if the portfolio choices reflect \u201crational\u201d, \u201cbehavioral\u201d or \u201cspeculative\u201d decisions.<i></i></span></p>\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5df4\u897f\u63a8\u51faRenda+\u548cEduca+\u503a\u5238\u5e2e\u52a9\u96f6\u552e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4e3a\u9000\u4f11\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u50a8\u84c4\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u4e0eAPP\u63a8\u8350\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u7406\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u8fd8\u662f\u6295\u673a\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "research_question": "\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5728\u9009\u62e9Renda+\u548cEduca+\u503a\u5238\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u662f\u7406\u6027\u7684\u3001\u53d7\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u6295\u673a\u6027\u7684\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5df4\u897f\u653f\u5e9c\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u503a\u5238\u5de5\u5177\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u514b\u670d\u91d1\u878d\u7d20\u517b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6295\u8d44\u6570\u636e\u4e0eAPP\u63a8\u8350\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7a76\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u884c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7406\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6295\u673a\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5df4\u897f\u8d22\u653f\u90e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5730\u533a\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4APP\u63a8\u8350\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6295\u8d44\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u516d\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u6295\u8d44\u8c1c\u9898\u3002", "findings": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e74\u8f7b\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u8d2d\u4e70\u9762\u5411\u5e74\u957f\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u503a\u5238\uff0c\u5e74\u957f\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u66f4\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u63a8\u8350\u503a\u5238\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u503a\u5238\u51fa\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\u5e74\u9f84\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u5728\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u4f18\u5316\u91d1\u878d\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6559\u80b2\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u5730\u533a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u50a8\u84c4\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, this stability has been accompanied by a significant slowdown in economic growth. Specifically, the average annual growth rate from 1974 to 2022 has dropped to approximately 1%, down from around 7% in the preceding 20 years. Existing literature suggests we would expect economic growth to accelerate, particularly in the years following Greece's integration into the European Union in 1981. It did not occur, raising the question: why not? This essay offers the explanation that political stability in Greece has resulted from a redistribution mechanism of income and wealth, which was embedded in the 1975 Constitution. This mechanism established a broad range of new 'social' rights while further constraining property rights. By addressing these social rights through the public budget and imposing ad hoc burdens on the private economy, this mechanism enhanced political stability. However, in an open market economy like Greece's, this approach has proven counterproductive, leading to stagnation of economic growth and increasing the likelihood that political stability could be disrupted. To safeguard against the risks to democracy and even national sovereignty that this outlook presents, it is crucial to eliminate the aforementioned redistribution mechanism from the constitution. An even better solution would be to adopt the new constitution recently proposed by six eminent Greeks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5e0c\u814a\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u540e\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u653e\u7f13\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5baa\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u5165\u8d22\u5bcc\u518d\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5171\u9884\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5e02\u573a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4fee\u6539\u5baa\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5e0c\u814a\u57281974\u5e74\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u540e\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u663e\u8457\u653e\u7f13\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5e0c\u814a\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u540e\u5e74\u5747\u589e\u957f\u7387\u4ece7%\u964d\u81f31%\uff0c\u4e0e\u52a0\u5165\u6b27\u76df\u540e\u9884\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u52a0\u901f\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u53cd\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5baa\u6cd5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u4ea7\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u518d\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5baa\u6cd5\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790", "findings": "1975\u5e74\u5baa\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6536\u5165\u8d22\u5bcc\u518d\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\u548c\u6269\u5927\u793e\u4f1a\u6743\u5229\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5e02\u573a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u505c\u6ede", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5baa\u6cd5\u5236\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e0c\u814a\u5baa\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7eb3\u65b0\u5baa\u6cd5\u63d0\u6848\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f"}}

The study utilizes the variables of government public debt, inflation, per capita, money supply and interest rate. The study deploys the generalized linear model based on the heteroscedasticity problem that is associated with the study data set. The study is designed to seek practical implications for economic policies. In addition to examining the impacts of government public debt and inflation on per capita income, the study specifically examines the moderating effect of government public debt and inflation on per capita income as well as investigates the impact of money supply and interest rate on inflation and per capita income. The findings reveal that government public debt has a negative and significant effect on per capita income. In addition, the impact of inflation on per capita income is mild, positive and not significant. Also, the moderating effect of government public debt and inflation is negative and not significant on per capita income. In contrast, the impact of government public debt on inflation is positive and significant. The study recommends a reduction in government fiscal deficit and government borrowing to reduce inflation.

Originating within the U.S. national security community, the term describes how the physical impacts of climate change interact with and exacerbate pre-existing social, economic, and political vulnerabilities, thereby multiplying threats to peace and stability. While the framework has been instrumental in placing climate change on the security agenda, it is also critiqued for potentially constraining policy responses to a reactive, management-oriented posture rather than promoting transformative change. This study employs a qualitative, comparative case study methodology to deconstruct the threat multiplier effect through its cascading impacts. It first analyzes the first-order impact of climate change on critical resources, with a focus on water stress in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It then investigates the secondorder human consequence of climate-induced migration, examining patterns in the Sahel, Bangladesh, and Central America, and highlighting the profound legal and geopolitical challenges posed by the lack of international protection for \"climate refugees.\" Finally, through in-depth case studies of Syria and Sudan, the article analyzes how these combined pressures can culminate in the third-order outcome of political instability and violent conflict. The analysis reveals that governance is the critical mediating variable determining whether climate stress leads to instability. The article concludes by assessing the policy responses of the United Nations, European Union, and the United States, identifying key gaps, and advocating for an integrated policy framework that merges climate adaptation, development, and peacebuilding to address the multifaceted nature of climate-related security risks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u5a01\u80c1\u6269\u5927\u5668\"\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u5c42\u9012\u8fdb\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u6c14\u5019\u538b\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u6e90\u77ed\u7f3a\u3001\u79fb\u6c11\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u6f0f\u6d9e\u5f15\u53d1\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6cbb\u7406\u662f\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u4ecb\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6574\u5408\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u9762\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "research_question": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u5a01\u80c1\u6269\u5927\u5668\"\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u5c42\u6f0f\u6d9e\u5f15\u53d1\u5a01\u80c1\u6269\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6cbb\u7406\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\"\u5a01\u80c1\u6269\u5927\u5668\"\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u63a8\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u653f\u7b56\u54cd\u5e94\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u89e3\u6784\u5176\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ee5\"\u5a01\u80c1\u6269\u5927\u5668\"\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u6f0f\u6d9e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6269\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d1e\u7c7b\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9010\u5c42\u89e3\u6784\u5a01\u80c1\u6269\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u4e00\u7ea7\u5f71\u54cd(\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u538b\u529b\u3001\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168)\u2192\u4e8c\u7ea7\u5f71\u54cd(\u6c14\u5019\u79fb\u6c11)\u2192\u4e09\u7ea7\u5f71\u54cd(\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u66b4\u529b\u51b2\u7a81)\u3002", "findings": "\u6c14\u5019\u538b\u529b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u6e90\u77ed\u7f3a\u3001\u79fb\u6c11\u6f0f\u6d9e\u5f15\u53d1\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u5371\u673a\uff0c\u6cbb\u7406\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u4ecb\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u56fd\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u5728\"\u6c14\u5019\u96be\u6c11\"\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\"\u5a01\u80c1\u6269\u5927\u5668\"\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6cbb\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u4ecb\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6c14\u5019\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u3001\u6b27\u76df\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u7b49\u653f\u7b56\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6784\u5efa\u6574\u5408\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5efa\u8bbe\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u9762\u6027\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

With the traditional trade dependencies being upset, this paper explores how Nigeria's raw material advantage can be combined with The Bahamas' logistics, tourism, and services economy to generate new bilateral economic value. Drawing from trade gap analysis, mapping of transport infrastructure, and institutional congruence, the paper proposes a pragmatic strategy to bridge Africa and the Caribbean by forging robust, diversified supply chains. It also highlights shared legal frameworks, linguistic compatibility, and climate-based economic interests that can ease easy creation of partnerships. Major recommendations span public policy, private sector strategy, and cross-regional diplomacy and form a compelling case for Abuja-Nassau bold and collective action.

These zones, legally established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), grant sovereign rights over marine resources up to 200 nautical miles from a nation's coast. For Pacific nations, this translates into enormous geopolitical and economic significance. EEZs provide access to abundant fisheries, potential seabed minerals, and maritime tourism opportunities, forming the backbone of what is increasingly referred to as the \"Blue Economy.\" Beyond economic dimensions, these maritime zones offer strategic leverage in regional diplomacy, security partnerships, and ocean governance. This article explores how EEZs have evolved into critical assets for the Pacific Islands, enabling them to assert international presence, generate state revenue, and safeguard ecological sovereignty. Through policy analysis and comparative case studies, it reveals the dual function of EEZs as both economic lifelines and strategic tools. The study also highlights key challenges such as illegal fishing, capacity deficits in marine surveillance, and overreliance on foreign actors. Ultimately, it argues that the full realization of EEZ benefits depends on integrated governance, regional cooperation, and sustainable resource management practices tailored to small island contexts."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u5c9b\u56fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5c5e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u533a\u83b7\u5f97\u5de8\u5927\u6d77\u6d0b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9bEEZ\u65e2\u662f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u547d\u8109\u4e5f\u662f\u6218\u7565\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5c9b\u5c7f\u56fd\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u6cd5\u6355\u635e\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e13\u5c5e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u533a\u5982\u4f55\u6210\u4e3a\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u5c9b\u56fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d77\u6d0b\u533a\u57df\u5982\u4f55\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u6325\u7ecf\u6d4e\u547d\u8109\u548c\u6218\u7565\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u529f\u80fd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u5c9b\u56fd\u867d\u7136\u9646\u5730\u9762\u79ef\u5c0f\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u62e5\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u4e13\u5c5e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u533a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d77\u6d0b\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u5730\u4f4d\u548c\u4e3b\u6743\u7ef4\u62a4\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u6d77\u6d0b\u6cd5\u516c\u7ea6\uff08UNCLOS\uff09\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u84dd\u8272\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790EEZ\u5bf9\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u5c9b\u56fd\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76", "findings": "EEZ\u4e3a\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u5c9b\u56fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6e14\u4e1a\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u6d77\u5e95\u77ff\u4ea7\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u65c5\u6e38\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8d4b\u4e88\u5b83\u4eec\u533a\u57df\u5916\u4ea4\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u6760\u6746\u3002\u4f46\u4e5f\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u6cd5\u6355\u635e\u3001\u6d77\u6d0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5bf9\u5916\u56fd\u884c\u4e3a\u4f53\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u5c0f\u5c9b\u5c7f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u6d77\u6d0b\u6743\u76ca\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EEZ\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d44\u4ea7\u548c\u6218\u7565\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u529f\u80fd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u5c9b\u56fd\u5236\u5b9a\u7efc\u5408\u6cbb\u7406\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u52a0\u5f3a\u533a\u57df\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316EEZ\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u6218\u7565\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This article examines the multifaceted drivers and far-reaching consequences of demographic expansion in Chad, employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates demographic statistics, socioeconomic indicators, and policy analysis. The study identifies high fertility ratesaveraging 6.3 births per woman-as the principal driver of population growth, rooted in a complex interplay of cultural norms, limited access to reproductive health services, and low levels of female education. Contributing factors include a predominantly rural economy reliant on subsistence agriculture, where large family size is traditionally valued for labor, and persistent gender inequality that restricts women's autonomy in reproductive decision-making. The demographic momentum is further sustained by declining mortality rates, attributable to modest improvements in healthcare access and reductions in infant and child mortality, despite ongoing challenges in disease control and nutrition. The consequences of this rapid demographic expansion are wide-ranging. Economically, population growth places severe strain on limited public resources, exacerbating unemployment, underemployment, and income inequality. Education and healthcare systems struggle to keep pace with rising demand, resulting in overcrowded classrooms, insufficient teaching personnel, and inadequate medical infrastructure. Environmentally, the expansion accelerates land degradation, deforestation, and water scarcity, intensifying competition over natural resources and contributing to rural-urban migration. Socially and politically, rapid population growth amplifies pressures on governance structures, fuels intercommunal tensions-particularly over land and water-and complicates efforts toward national stability in a context already marked by fragility and conflict. The analysis underscores the urgent need for integrated policy interventions aimed at moderating population growth while maximizing the potential demographic dividend. Recommended strategies include expanding access to family planning and reproductive health services, investing in female education, promoting economic diversification beyond subsistence agriculture, and implementing sustainable resource management practices. The study concludes that without decisive and coordinated action, Chad's demographic trajectory risks deepening existing socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities, undermining prospects for long-term development and stability. Conversely, strategic investment in human capital and resource governance could enable the country to transform demographic pressures into a driver of inclusive growth."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e4d\u5f97\u4eba\u53e3\u9ad8\u901f\u589e\u957f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u9ad8\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u7ecf\u6d4e\u793e\u4f1a\u73af\u5883\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e4d\u5f97\u4eba\u53e3\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u5176\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e4d\u5f97\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u6700\u5feb\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u4eba\u53e3\u6269\u5f20\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790", "findings": "\u9ad8\u751f\u80b2\u7387\uff08\u5e73\u57476.3\u80ce\uff09\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u751f\u6b96\u5065\u5eb7\u670d\u52a1\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5973\u6027\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u4f4e\uff1b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u7d27\u5f20\u3001\u73af\u5883\u9000\u5316\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u4eba\u53e3\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7efc\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\u6269\u5927\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u80b2\u670d\u52a1\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u5973\u6027\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u591a\u5143\u5316\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e4d\u5f97\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u56fd\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u653f\u7b56\u6307\u5bfc"}}

The starting point of my analysis is a generalized version of Burdett and Mortensen's (1998) job ladder model featuring risk-neutral firms, risk-averse workers, and aggregate risk. Because of on-the-job search, my model generates wage rigidity both for incumbent workers, through standard insurance motives, and for new hires, through novel strategic complementarities in wage setting between firms. In contrast to the conventional wisdom in the macro literature, the introduction of on-the-job search implies that: (i) the wage rigidity of incumbent workers, rather than new hires, is the critical determinant of unemployment fluctuations; (ii) fairness considerations in wage setting dampen, rather than amplify, unemployment fluctuations; and (iii) new hire wages are too flexible, rather than too rigid, in the decentralized equilibrium. Quantitatively, the wage rigidity of incumbent workers caused by the insurance motive alone accounts for about one fifth of the unemployment fluctuations observed in the data.&nbsp;"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u548c\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u7684Burdett-Mortensen\u5de5\u4f5c\u9636\u68af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5728\u804c\u641c\u5bfb\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u5de5\u4eba\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5728\u804c\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u800c\u975e\u65b0\u96c7\u5458\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u662f\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u516c\u5e73\u8003\u8651\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\u800c\u975e\u653e\u5927\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1b\u65b0\u96c7\u5458\u5de5\u8d44\u5728\u5206\u6563\u5747\u8861\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7075\u6d3b\u800c\u975e\u8fc7\u4e8e\u521a\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u804c\u641c\u5bfb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u548c\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b8f\u89c2\u6587\u732e\u5bf9\u65b0\u96c7\u5458\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5728\u804c\u641c\u5bfb\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6269\u5c55\u7684Burdett-Mortensen(1998)\u5de5\u4f5c\u9636\u68af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u6027\u4f01\u4e1a\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u5de5\u4eba\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5728\u804c\u641c\u5bfb\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "1)\u5728\u804c\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u662f\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b2)\u516c\u5e73\u8003\u8651\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1b3)\u65b0\u96c7\u5458\u5de5\u8d44\u5728\u5206\u6563\u5747\u8861\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7075\u6d3b\uff1b4)\u4fdd\u9669\u52a8\u673a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7ea6\u4e94\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b8f\u89c2\u6587\u732e\u5173\u4e8e\u65b0\u96c7\u5458\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u804c\u641c\u5bfb\u5728\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u548c\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u4e1a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5173\u6ce8\u5728\u804c\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u521a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5173\u6ce8\u65b0\u96c7\u5458\u5de5\u8d44\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

This volume examines how taste, smell, sound, color, and texture shape our perception of food, drawing on perspectives from art, history, neuroscience, and philosophy. Through discussions on synesthesia, olfactory memory, cultural identity, and the ethics of flavor innovation, the book invites readers to view food not merely as sustenance but as a multi-dimensional medium of meaning, emotion, and connection. It is an essential resource for chefs, scholars, and anyone seeking a deeper understanding of how food defines our humanity."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u300a\u7f8e\u98df\u54f2\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e09\u5377\uff1a\u611f\u5b98\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u300b\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u5b98\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7f8e\u98df\u6587\u5316\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5473\u89c9\u3001\u55c5\u89c9\u3001\u58f0\u97f3\u3001\u989c\u8272\u548c\u8d28\u5730\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u98df\u7269\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u5b98\u4f53\u9a8c\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u7f8e\u98df\u7684\u6587\u5316\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u98df\u7269\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7406\u89e3\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u98df\u7269\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u7ef4\u6301\u751f\u547d\u7684\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u5177\u6709\u591a\u7ef4\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u5a92\u4ecb\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u5185\u6db5\uff0c\u4e3a\u53a8\u5e08\u3001\u5b66\u8005\u548c\u666e\u901a\u8bfb\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u98df\u7269\u5982\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u827a\u672f\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8054\u89c9\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u55c5\u89c9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6587\u5316\u8ba4\u540c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u98ce\u5473\u521b\u65b0\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u63a2\u8ba8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u89c2\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u611f\u5b98\u4f53\u9a8c\u5728\u98df\u7269\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u611f\u5b98\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5473\u89c9\u3001\u55c5\u89c9\u3001\u542c\u89c9\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u89e6\u89c9\uff09\u5171\u540c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u98df\u7269\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7f8e\u98df\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u611f\u5b98\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u7f8e\u98df\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u611f\u5b98\u54f2\u5b66\u548c\u7f8e\u98df\u7f8e\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u53a8\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u611f\u5b98\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f8e\u98df\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u666e\u901a\u8bfb\u8005\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u98df\u7269\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Depending on the context, the settlement may take on many forms, including consent orders and settlement agreements. This begs the question of whether the exact form of settlement matters, or whether a settlement \"by any other name\" suffices. This article proposes the concept of \"sustainable settlements\"-comprising the measures of ease of enforcement, finality, and confidentiality-to holistically appraise the effectiveness of settlement mechanisms. The assessment of six settlement mechanisms using these measures clearly indicates that not every mechanism is equally sustainable. Exploring settlement amidst the increasingly complex dispute resolution landscape thus requires greater prudence in the choice of settlement mechanisms, that is informed by both the context as well as jurisprudence concerning enforceability, finality and confidentiality."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6c11\u4e8b\u53f8\u6cd5\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e00\u8d35\u9f13\u52b1\u79c1\u4e0b\u548c\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u548c\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u89e3\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u548c\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u673a\u5236\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u548c\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u91cd\u8981\uff1f\u662f\u5426\u4efb\u4f55\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u548c\u89e3\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6c11\u4e8b\u53f8\u6cd5\u4f53\u7cfb\u5f3a\u8c03\u79c1\u4e0b\u548c\u89e3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u548c\u89e3\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6548\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\"\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u89e3\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6613\u4e8e\u6027\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u548c\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u540c\u610f\u4ee4\u548c\u548c\u89e3\u534f\u8bae\u7b49\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "findings": "\u4e0d\u540c\u548c\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u5728\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u6240\u6709\u673a\u5236\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u529b\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u89e3\"\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u548c\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u52a1\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u548c\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u53f8\u6cd5\u5224\u4f8b\u3002"}}

Persistent barriers\u2014including unconscious bias, gendered evaluation criteria, and unequal caregiving burdens\u2014continue to hinder women\u2019s advancement, even as research demonstrates the financial and organizational benefits of gender-diverse leadership.</p>\n<p><span>Aim</span><span>: This study evaluates the extent, drivers, and outcomes of gender inclusion in leadership roles within FTSE 350 companies, focusing on representation, pay equity, and policy effectiveness.</span></p>\n<p><span>Objectives</span><span>: The study (1) examines gender representation in employment, management, and executive boards, and (2) assesses pay disparities between genders across FTSE 350 firms.</span></p>\n<p><span>Methodology</span><span>: A positivist, deductive approach was employed, analyzing longitudinal secondary data (2013\u20132022) from Refinitiv Eikon. Descriptive statistics and panel-data regression models tested three hypotheses on gender distribution, leadership representation, and pay gaps. Ethical safeguards ensured data integrity and reproducibility.</span></p>\n<p><span>Findings</span><span>: Women constituted only 34.42% of employees and 24.26% of managers, with even lower representation on boards (21.55%).

Yet, rural adoption remains inconsistent due to infrastructural constraints, socioeconomic barriers, and trust deficits. This study examines digital banking penetration in Bhende BK, a village in Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, combining primary survey data from 100 residents with secondary data from RBI, NABARD, and the World Bank. Applying the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, the findings reveal high UPI adoption among youth (78%) but markedly lower uptake among older adults (23%). Major barriers include poor internet connectivity (62%), fear of fraud (48%), limited financial literacy (41%), and language barriers (35%). Comparative insights from Kenya's M-Pesa and Bangladesh's bKash highlight the importance of trust networks, vernacular interfaces, and integration with local financial ecosystems. The study contributes actionable policy recommendations for bridging the rural digital divide, including infrastructure upgrades, localized language support, and targeted literacy programs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5370\u5ea6\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7fa4UPI\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\uff0878%\uff09\u4f46\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0823%\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u5305\u62ec\u7f51\u7edc\u94fe\u63a5\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6050\u6168\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u5ea6\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6d17\u900f\u60c5\u51b5\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u56e0\u7d20\u6709\u54ea\u4e9b\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u9769\u547d\u867d\u7136\u53d8\u9769\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u91c7\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u4f53\u969c\u788d\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\uff08TAM\uff09\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9aM-Pesa\u548c\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fdbKash\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u9a6c\u54c8\u62c9\u65af\u7279\u90e8Ahmednagar\u53bfBhende BK\u6751\u7684100\u540d\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6765\u81ea\u5370\u5ea6\u592e\u884c\u3001NABARD\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u4e8c\u624b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7fa4UPI\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe78%\uff0c\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\u4ec523%\uff1b\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u5305\u62ec\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0862%\uff09\u3001\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6050\u6168\uff0848%\uff09\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u6709\u9650\uff0841%\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d\uff0835%\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u519c\u6751\u6570\u5b57\u91d1\u878d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4fe1\u4efb\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u672c\u571f\u5316\u754c\u9762\u548c\u672c\u5730\u91d1\u878d\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5347\u7ea7\u3001\u672c\u5730\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u7d20\u517b\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u519c\u6751\u6570\u5b57\u6c9f\u5dee\u3002"}}

The answers to these questions go beyond the current situation in D.C., as the president\u2019s reliance on untested legal authorities combined with his willingness to use the military for myriad domestic missions in D.C. and elsewhere may well foreshadow broader use of the military in other American cities.</span><span>These questions include:</span></p>\n<p><span>-&nbsp;</span><span><span>What are the relevant legal authorities underpinning the National Guard deployments?</span></span></p>\n<p><span>-&nbsp;</span><span><span>What can the National Guard units do while in D.C.?</span></span></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><span>-&nbsp;</span><span><span>Will Trump invoke the Insurrection Act?</span></span></p>\n<p><b><span></span></b></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u7279\u6717\u666e\u603b\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u56fd\u6c11\u8b66\u536b\u961f\u5230\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u9650\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u63f4\u5f15\u7684\u300a\u53db\u4e71\u6cd5\u300b\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u672a\u7ecf\u68c0\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u529b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u80fd\u9884\u793a\u7740\u519b\u65b9\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5176\u4ed6\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u7279\u6717\u666e\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u7f72\u56fd\u6c11\u8b66\u536b\u961f\u5230\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f9d\u636e\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u8fd9\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u54ea\u4e9b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7279\u6717\u666e\u603b\u7edf\u57282020\u5e748\u6708\u521d\u90e8\u7f72\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u56fd\u6c11\u8b66\u536b\u961f\u6253\u51fb\u72af\u7f6a\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5171\u548c\u515a\u5dde\u957f\u4e5f\u5ba3\u5e03\u5411\u9996\u90fd\u6d3e\u9063\u8b66\u536b\u961f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u519b\u4e8b\u529b\u91cf\u5728\u56fd\u5185\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u9650\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5173\u5207\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5baa\u6cd5\u6743\u529b\u5206\u914d\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u56fd\u5185\u519b\u4e8b\u90e8\u7f72\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u884c\u653f\u6743\u529b\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u56fd\u6c11\u8b66\u536b\u961f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6388\u6743\uff08\u5982\u300a\u53db\u4e71\u6cd5\u300b\uff09\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u5148\u4f8b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "findings": "\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f9d\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u7591\u95ee\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u603b\u7edf\u613f\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\u519b\u65b9\u6267\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u56fd\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u7f8e\u56fd\u57ce\u5e02\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u519b\u4e8b\u529b\u91cf\u5f00\u521b\u5148\u4f8b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u884c\u653f\u6743\u529b\u5728 domestic deployment of military forces \u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b66\u8005\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u56fd\u5185\u519b\u4e8b\u90e8\u7f72\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b64\u7c7b\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Using proprietary data, we investigate how supervisors aggregate multi-rater assessments into initial performance ratings and how calibration committees adjust these aggregation decisions. Our findings indicate that both supervisors and calibration committees generally follow the principles of information economics. When aggregating multi-rater assessments, supervisors assess the informativeness of different assessments and place more weight on more informative assessments. However, our results also reveal limitations in information processing. Under conditions of high information load, supervisors appear to rely on cognitive shortcuts, engaging less in detailed weighting decisions based on the informativeness of individual multi-rater assessments. Regarding calibration, we find that committees are less likely to adjust supervisors' aggregation decisions when those decisions are consistent with more informative multi-rater assessments and when supervisors provide well-substantiated justifications, highlighting the complementary roles of multi-rater systems and calibration. Additionally, calibration committees appear to strategically focus on cases where supervisors face a high information load and information sources that may not have been fully incorporated into the initial performance ratings."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u901a\u5e38\u9075\u5faa\u4fe1\u606f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0b\u4f1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba4\u77e5\u5feb\u6377\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4f1a\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u8d1f\u8377\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "research_question": "\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u591a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u805a\u5408\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u805a\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6b64\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u591f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u606f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5feb\u6377\u65b9\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u9650\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u805a\u5408\u591a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "findings": "1\uff09\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff1b2\uff09\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0b\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u4f1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba4\u77e5\u5feb\u6377\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5c11\u8c03\u6574\u7b26\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u539f\u5219\u7684\u805a\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b4\uff09\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u8d1f\u8377\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

These firms also involve in more product-related negative incidents. This relationship is most pronounced among financially constrained firms. These results highlight the real economic consequences of earnings management and provide new evidence on how capital market pressures can create negative externalities for consumers."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d22\u52a1\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u7684\u6bcf\u80a1\u6536\u76ca\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u8fdb\u884c\u80a1\u7968\u56de\u8d2d\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ec\u56de\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u8d22\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "research_question": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u77ed\u671f\u8d22\u52a1\u523a\u6fc0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u4f1a\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5931\u8d25\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u80a1\u5e02\u538b\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8425\u6536\u7ba1\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5916\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u77ed\u671f\u8d22\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u800c\u6291\u5236\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u77ed\u671f\u4e3b\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8425\u6536\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u51b2\u7a81\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u65ad\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08RDD\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u6bcf\u80a1\u6536\u76ca\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u65ad\u70b9\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7a84\u7ec4\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u8d2d\u56de\u80a1\u7968\u6ee1\u8db3\u8425\u6536\u76ee\u6807\u540e\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ec\u56de\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "findings": "\u901a\u8fc7\u80a1\u7968\u56de\u8d2d\u7a84\u7f16\u4f01\u4e1a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8425\u6536\u76ee\u6807\u540e\uff0c\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ec\u56de\u6982\u7387\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ec\u56de\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u8054\u5728\u8d22\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8425\u6536\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u77ed\u671f\u8d22\u52a1\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ecf\u6d4e\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u5982\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u9192\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u4f01\u4e1a\u77ed\u671f\u8d22\u52a1\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5185\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

But one critical question remains\u2014how and when courts should engage in a different type of review: the deferential \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. In applying this standard post-Loper Bright, courts face a dual risk. First, they may be too hard on government agencies and end up substituting the policy judgments of the court for those of agency experts; State Farm arbitrariness review should be highly deferential. But second, if they engage in this deferential review too early in the process\u2014merging it together with de novo legal review\u2014they may be committing the sin of Chevron and deferring to agencies on legal questions of statutory construction. To avoid this pitfall, this paper lays out a simple formula for courts, combining a decades-long review of statutory and judicial history with an application of the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent decisions.</p>\n<p>This article makes two arguments.&nbsp; First, leaning on cases from before the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act to the present, this paper argues that State Farm arbitrariness review should be extremely deferential to agency decision making. So long as the agency\u2019s action is \u201creasonable and reasonably explained,\u201d then courts have no role in substituting their own judgment for that of the agency\u2019s. Second, the Supreme Court was clear in both Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and an even-more recent case, Seven County Infrastructure v. Eagle County, that de novo legal review and deferential arbitrariness review are two distinct and different steps. If a court conflates the two steps\u2014and some have\u2014it will smuggle deference into legal review and risk a Chevron redux.</p>\n<p>Using hypotheticals and real-life cases, including Loper Bright and its sister case Relentless on remand, this paper establishes a clear path for courts to follow. This paper\u2019s recommendation might seem paradoxical: courts should both go easier on agencies when reviewing discretionary decision making for arbitrariness, while being stricter when analyzing whether an agency is behaving lawfully. But this is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance\u2014courts must sharply distinguish these two steps and their differing standards of review.&nbsp;</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Loper Bright\u6848\u540e\u6cd5\u9662\u5982\u4f55\u533a\u5206\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684de novo\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u884c\u653f\u88c1\u91cf\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u5c06\u4e24\u79cd\u5ba1\u67e5\u6807\u51c6\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728Loper Bright\u6848\u5e9f\u9664Chevron\u5c0a\u91cd\u539f\u5219\u540e\uff0c\u6cd5\u9662\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u6b63\u786e\u533a\u5206\u548c\u5e94\u7528de novo\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u88c1\u91cf\u5ba1\u67e5\u6807\u51c6\uff1f", "motivation": "Loper Bright\u6848\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6cd5\u9662\u5bf9\u884c\u653f\u673a\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6cd5\u9662\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u5ba1\u67e5\u6807\u51c6\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u53cc\u91cd\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u82db\u5730\u66ff\u4ee3\u884c\u653f\u673a\u5173\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u65e9\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u5c0a\u91cd\u6807\u51c6\u800c\u53d8\u76f8\u6062\u590dChevron\u539f\u5219\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684State Farm\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u5ba1\u67e5\u6807\u51c6\u548cLoper Bright\u6848\u786e\u7acb\u7684de novo\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5ba1\u67e5\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408APA\u5236\u5b9a\u524d\u540e\u7684\u5224\u4f8b\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56de\u987eAPA\u5236\u5b9a\u524d\u540e\u7684\u5224\u4f8b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u6700\u65b0\u5224\u4f8b\uff08Loper Bright\u3001Seven County Infrastructure\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "findings": "State Farm\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u5ba1\u67e5\u5e94\u5f53\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5c0a\u91cd\u884c\u653f\u673a\u5173\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u884c\u653f\u884c\u4e3a\"\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u6709\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\"\uff1bde novo\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u5ba1\u67e5\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4e25\u683c\u533a\u5206\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u540eChevron\u65f6\u4ee3\u6cd5\u9662\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u53cc\u8f68\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u5ba1\u67e5\u6807\u51c6\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5f15\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6cd5\u9662\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6cd5\u5b98\u907f\u514d\u5c06\u5c0a\u91cd\u6027\u5ba1\u67e5\u8fc7\u65e9\u5f15\u5165\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u53d8\u76f8\u6062\u590dChevron\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u884c\u653f\u88c1\u91cf\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u5c0a\u91cd\u3002"}}

It focuses on two key questions: (1) Which firms receive EU funding? (2) How does receiving EU funding affect firm performance? By applying a logit model and a local projection difference-in-differences approach, we provide new insights into the allocation mechanisms of EU Cohesion Policy funds and their firm-level impact. Our findings show that funding tends to be allocated to firms that already perform relatively well, and that firms receiving EU funding experience a persistent productivity increase of approximately 3% after 4 years, with smaller and more financially constrained firms experiencing relatively greater improvements. Moreover, funding targeting \u201cSME investment\u201d tends to enhance firm performance disproportionately more than other categories, whereas projects directed the \u201cgreen transition\u201d appear comparatively less beneficial."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u805a\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d44\u91d1\u4f18\u5148\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u83b7\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\u57284\u5e74\u540e\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u63d0\u9ad83%\uff0c\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f01\u4e1a\u6536\u76ca\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\"SME\u6295\u8d44\"\u7c7b\u9879\u76ee\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\"\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\"\u9879\u76ee\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "research_question": "1\uff09\u54ea\u4e9b\u4f01\u4e1a\u83b7\u5f97\u6b27\u76df\u8d44\u52a9\uff1f2\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u6b27\u76df\u8d44\u52a9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b27\u76df\u805a\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u8d44\u91d1\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "theoretical_framework": "\u6295\u8d44\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d44\u91d1\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Orbis\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u548cKohesio\u9879\u76ee\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528logit\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6295\u5f71\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5", "findings": "\u8d44\u91d1\u4f18\u5148\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\uff1b\u83b7\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u57284\u5e74\u540e\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u7ea63%\uff1b\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f01\u4e1a\u6536\u76ca\u66f4\u5927\uff1b\"SME\u6295\u8d44\"\u7c7b\u9879\u76ee\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\"\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\"\u9879\u76ee\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5dee", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u805a\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u8d44\u91d1\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u6548\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b0\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6295\u8d44\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7406\u8bba", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6b27\u76df\u805a\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8c03\u6574\u6295\u8d44\u91cd\u70b9\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49"}}

This paper investigates the emergent role of digital twins in the development of financial skills through education technology (EdTech), with a particular emphasis on risk management and budgeting competencies. We provide a definition of the digital twin concept and examine its significance in the context of personalized education and experiential learning. Practical implementation models that demonstrate how digital twins facilitate realistic budgeting simulations and risk management scenarios are presented in conjunction with a review of theoretical frameworks (e.g., simulation-based learning and learning analytics). We present case studies and pilot programs from a variety of regions, such as academic-industry collaborations, school-based financial literacy simulations, and fintech-driven initiatives, to illustrate the global scope of these applications. The technological infrastructure (including real-time data integration and AI-driven learner analytics) and pedagogical models (including adaptive feedback loops and experiential learning) that are facilitated by digital twins are examined. We also address the implications for key stakeholders, including educators who acquire powerful new tools for engagement and assessment, learners who benefit from immersive and personalized practice environments, financial institutions and EdTech developers who see new opportunities for innovation, and policymakers who encounter both opportunities and challenges in scaling such models. The paper is organized as a formal research exposition, consisting of an introduction to the background literature, a comprehensive discussion, the methodology of analysis, and conclusions.

Coverage of trade agreements is a quantitative component of that effort; there is also a qualitative component. If market access is to be of any value, it must be meaningful. And meaningful access must entail the availability of remedies for disappointed suppliers such as those mandated by the Agreement on Government Procurement. Until now little effort has been made to assess the utilization of such procedures at the subcentral level. This article fills that gap. It assembles data on bid protest rates for 27 of the 37 signatory states as well as 9 of the 13 non-signatory states. Litigation in both groups is robust. On average, protests in the United States are at least as common at the state level as at the federal level. Apart from the inherent value of such data, one would hope that awareness that protests are common at the state level would foster confidence among foreign suppliers and thus encourage greater participation from abroad.<br><br>This article was first published by Thomson Reuters in Public Procurement Law Review at 34 Pub.

As a country that had brutally invaded many East and Southeast Asian nations, Japan had to endure the bitter taste of defeat when, on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped its first atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, the second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. It is estimated that the death toll in these two cities was about 350,000 people. Since then, both the world and the Japanese people have been horrified to realize the extreme destructive power of nuclear weapons. Although memorial ceremonies for the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are still held every year, this year, exactly eighty years later, a worrying reality is gradually emerging as the general situation has changed radically contradictory: the postwar generation is no longer interested in the memory of the historical past.

Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research combines a review of existing literature, case studies of recent deepfake incidents, and expert interviews with cybersecurity and intelligence professionals. Key findings indicate that deepfakes significantly amplify risks related to misinformation campaigns, electoral interference, and geopolitical tensions. Additionally, the study highlights current challenges in detection technologies and policy responses.

Building on a provocative theory circulating among policymakers, it explores the possibility that President Trump\u2019s second-term tariff strategy aimed not merely at confronting foreign adversaries, but at reshaping external balances, stabilizing bond markets, and reducing reliance on foreign capital inflows. At the same time, the use of hidden, regressive tariffs helped to subsidize and sustain large-scale tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy, shifting the fiscal burden onto ordinary consumers without legislative transparency or consent.</p>\n<p>Whether or not this theory fully captures the administration\u2019s intent, the constitutional and institutional dangers it reveals are profound. By repurposing tariffs to achieve fiscal objectives, the executive branch constructs a system of hidden, regressive taxation that bypasses Congress\u2019s exclusive authority under Article I of the U.S. Constitution. This practice severs the constitutional link between taxation and democratic accountability, replacing transparent lawmaking with opaque executive discretion. Tariffs, once instruments of trade policy, become de facto taxes imposed without public debate, statutory clarity, or procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p>Beyond domestic concerns, this Article situates the phenomenon within the broader framework of international law. The unilateral imposition of tariffs for debt management purposes strains U.S. compliance with core World Trade Organization obligations, undermining the credibility of the rules-based trading system at a moment of deepening global economic fragmentation.</p>\n<p>By tracing the emergence of a \"shadow fiscal state\" through the executive\u2019s tariff powers, this Article offers a new lens for understanding the erosion of constitutional governance and international economic norms. It concludes by proposing structural reforms, including a dual-track system for tariff actions modeled on administrative law procedures, to restore congressional control over fiscal policy and reinvigorate democratic transparency in taxation.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u9732\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d22\u653f\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u653f\u6743\u529b\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7a0e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f7\u85cf\u7684\u503a\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8d22\u653f\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u56fd\u4f1a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5e76\u7834\u574f\u6cd5\u6cbb\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "research_question": "\u7279\u6717\u666e\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u5173\u7a0e\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5bf9\u5916\u8d38\u6613\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f7\u85cf\u7684\u8d22\u653f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u503a\u52a1\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u503a\u5238\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u8d22\u653f\u8d1f\u62c5\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u884c\u653f\u6743\u529b\u5bf9\u5173\u7a0e\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u7ed5\u8fc7\u56fd\u4f1a\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u6743\u9650\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96f7\u85cf\u7684\u9006\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7a0e\u6536\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u5baa\u653f\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u5f0a\u7684\u5371\u9669\u8fdb\u884c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u5baa\u6cd5\u7b2c\u4e00\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u56fd\u4f1a\u7a0e\u6536\u6743\u9650\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7a0e\u6536\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u4e16\u8d38\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e49\u52a1\u7684\u89c4\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u7279\u6717\u666e\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u5173\u7a0e\u653f\u7b56\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u58f0\u79f0\u7684\u8d38\u6613\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8d22\u653f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5ba1\u67e5\u5236\u5ea6\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u5baa\u653f\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u5f0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "findings": "\u884c\u653f\u90e8\u95e8\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7a0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f7\u85cf\u7684\u8d22\u653f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ba1\u7406\u503a\u52a1\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u503a\u5238\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5bcc\u9636\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a0e\u6536\u8865\u8d34\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u505a\u6cd5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e86\u56fd\u4f1a\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u6743\u9650\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u7a0e\u6536\u4e0e\u6c11\u4e3b\u8d1f\u8d23\u5236\u7684\u5baa\u653f\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e16\u8d38\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4e49\u52a1\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u9634\u5f71\u8d22\u653f\u56fd\u5bb6\"\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5ba1\u67e5\u5236\u5ea6\u6d41\u8870\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u7ecf\u6d4e\u89c4\u8303\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5c06\u884c\u653f\u6743\u529b\u3001\u5ba1\u67e5\u5236\u5ea6\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u8d22\u653f\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u53cc\u8f68\u5236\u5173\u7a0e\u884c\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u56fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u8d22\u653f\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u7a0e\u6536\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

It models legal ethics as a three-faced structure\u2014professional role, common morality, and political philosophy\u2014so that conflicts among them can be diagnosed rather than obscured. Methodologically, it draws on applied ethics. Substantively, it builds on Michael Pritchard\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Professional Integrity</em>&nbsp;to connect subjective deliberation (virtue, character, conscience) with objective, action-guiding standards for professional conduct, and to foreground \u201cgood work\u201d as well as the prevention of misconduct. It also engages David Luban\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Lawyers and Justice</em>\u2014especially his account of \u201cneutral partisanship\u201d as the conjunction of partisanship with moral neutrality within an adversary system\u2014to specify what can and cannot be bracketed by role obligations. The analysis clarifies (i) defense counsel\u2019s neutral partisanship vis-\u00e0-vis judicial impartiality; (ii) prosecutorial ethics as a dual mandate in which role-based duties and system-facing duties diverge under adversarial stress; and (iii) judicial ethics that calibrate discipline for legal error without chilling independence. To justify institutional departures from common morality, the study favors a \u201ccumulative-weight\u201d test over \u201cminimum-threshold\u201d algorithms, aligning institutional defenses with reason-giving that is sensitive to moral salience. Case studies (the Lake Pleasant and Alton Logan matters) demonstrate preventive and aspirational payoffs\u2014showing how the framework organizes hard cases, guides role-conflict decisions, and makes professional reasoning intelligible to non-lawyers. Overall, the project integrates Pritchard\u2019s virtue-centered integrity with Luban\u2019s institutional analysis to yield an evaluative vocabulary and decision tools for comparative and pedagogical use in legal ethics.</p>\n<p><span><br>\n   * This is identical to the version available at&nbsp;</span><a rel=\"nofollow\">https://doi.org/10.15057/83104</a></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u6784\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u5211\u4e8b\u53f8\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0e\u5171\u540c\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f26\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e09\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u4e13\u4e1a\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u5171\u540c\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u54f2\u5b66\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bca\u65ad\u800c\u975e\u63a9\u76d6\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f26\u7406\u4e2d\u89d2\u8272\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u5171\u540c\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u54f2\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f26\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e13\u4e1a\u89d2\u8272\u4e49\u52a1\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u9053\u5fb7\u6807\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5211\u4e8b\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u51b2\u7a81\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eMichael Pritchard\u7684\u300a\u804c\u4e1a\u8bda\u4fe1\u300b\u548cDavid Luban\u7684\u300a\u5f8b\u5e08\u4e0e\u6b63\u4e49\u300b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08Lake Pleasant\u548cAlton Logan\u6848\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7d2f\u79ef\u6743\u91cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u800c\u975e\u6700\u4f4e\u9608\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "1) \u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8fa9\u62a4\u5f8b\u5e08\u7684\u4e2d\u7acb\u515a\u6d3e\u6027\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53f8\u6cd5\u516c\u6b63\u6027\uff1b2) \u68c0\u65b9\u4f26\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cc\u91cd\u4f7f\u547d\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u89d2\u8272\u4e49\u52a1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e49\u52a1\u4f1a\u5206\u5316\uff1b3) \u53f8\u6cd5\u4f26\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u6291\u5236\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u60e9\u6212\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6574\u5408\u4e86Pritchard\u4ee5\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bda\u4fe1\u89c2\u548cLuban\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f26\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e13\u4e1a\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u975e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4eba\u58eb\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u89d2\u8272\u51b2\u7a81\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

The study aims to analyze how deepfakes-AI-generated synthetic media-can be weaponized to undermine political stability, spread disinformation, and disrupt critical security frameworks. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research combines a review of existing literature, case studies of recent deepfake incidents, and expert interviews with cybersecurity and intelligence professionals. Key findings indicate that deepfakes significantly amplify risks related to misinformation campaigns, electoral interference, and geopolitical tensions. Additionally, the study highlights current challenges in detection technologies and policy responses. The conclusion emphasizes the urgent need for enhanced technological countermeasures, cross-sector collaboration, and proactive policy frameworks to mitigate the national security risks posed by deepfakes."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5a92\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u6b66\u5668\u5316\u6765\u7834\u574f\u653f\u6cbb\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6270\u4e71\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u7b56\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "research_question": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u6b66\u5668\u5316\u6765\u7834\u574f\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u6218\u548c\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u3001\u8fd1\u671f\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u60c5\u62a5\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "findings": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u9009\u4e3e\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u7d27\u5f20\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u5bf9\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6218\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a0\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u7b56\u3001\u8de8\u90e8\u95e8\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, many US states and Canadian provinces have domestic review procedures that comply with some, but not all, of Article XVIII s requirements. In addition, some US state and Canadian provincial challenge mechanisms arguably comply with a minimal interpretation of Article XVIIL but not with a more robust, purposive interpretation. In other words, US state and Canadian provincial domestic review procedures help to reveal a host of ambiguities in the text of Article XVIII Some of these ambiguities may have been apparent to the negotiators who drafted the text and may reflect deliberate attempts to accommodate diverse national legal systems. We suspect, however, that some other ambiguities may not have been widely understood at the time the text was adopted.

Strategic human resource development and retention are key to attaining the target. But, declining enrolment in relevant disciplines and academic migration paint a worrisome picture. This research investigates and analyses various aspects of job satisfaction among power plant engineers working in Nepal, such as, workplace safety, salary and benefits, training and development, recognition and acknowledgement, mentorship and guidance, level of work related stress and promotion and growth. The findings suggest varying levels of satisfaction, with certain areas necessitating prompt interventions. The research recommends developing a mentorship culture, improving safety, promoting gender inclusion, reevaluating compensation packages, and investing in trainings and development. Additionally, it also offers insights for the government to introduce minimum wage standards for engineers, improve safety practices, encourage gender diversity and align curriculum to suit industry needs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u80fd\u6e90\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e862035\u5e74\u8fbe\u523028,500\u5146\u74e6\u88c5\u673a\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u4e13\u4e1a\u5165\u5b66\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u79fb\u6c11\u95ee\u9898\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u7535\u5382\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u7535\u5382\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u72b6\u51b5\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u54ea\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u80fd\u6e90\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u624d\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u4e13\u4e1a\u5165\u5b66\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u4eba\u624d\u6d41\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u6765\u7559\u4f4f\u4eba\u624d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u85aa\u916c\u798f\u5229\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u8ba4\u53ef\u8d5e\u8d4f\u3001\u5bfc\u5e08\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u538b\u529b\u548c\u664b\u5347\u6210\u957f\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u95ee\u5377\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u5382\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u7acb\u5373\u5e72\u9884\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e1a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5efa\u7acb\u5bfc\u5e08\u6587\u5316\u3001\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u5168\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u85aa\u916c\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u57f9\u8bad\u53d1\u5c55\u7b49\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We present VECTARA(f), a comprehensive deterministic action governance framework that unifies epistemic modeling, cross-domain emergency coordination, indigenous knowledge integration, and quantum-resistant democratic processes. The system introduces twelve foundational innovations spanning from cultural ethnographic NLP to hybrid quantum-classical voting, achieving 35% latency reduction, 92% confidence in black-box AGI modeling, and sub-15-minute cross-domain emergency coordination while maintaining 0.8+ cultural authenticity across diverse knowledge systems. Through comprehensive evaluation across medical, financial, and transportation emergency scenarios, we demonstrate that integrated governance architectures can simultaneously address seemingly contradictory requirements: rapid emergency response with democratic deliberation, cultural diversity with universal principles, and proprietary systems with transparent accountability. This work establishes foundational intellectual property across the emerging AGI governance market while demonstrating commercial viability for enterprise deployment."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VECTARA(f)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86AGI\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6587\u5316\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u95ee\u8d23\u7b49\u770b\u4f3c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc712\u9879\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684AGI\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6587\u5316\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u95ee\u8d23\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AGI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6587\u5316\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u95ee\u8d23\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u6025\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u672c\u571f\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6297\u6027\u6c11\u4e3b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1VECTARA(f)\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u884c\u52a8\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6587\u5316\u6c11\u65cf\u5fd7NLP\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6295\u7968\u7b4912\u9879\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u5e94\u6025\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8635%\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u300192%\u9ed1\u76d2AGI\u5efa\u6a21\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u300115\u5206\u949f\u5185\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u6025\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u63010.8+\u7684\u6587\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u6cbb\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u6c11\u4e3b\u5ba1\u8bae\u3001\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u666e\u904d\u539f\u5219\u3001\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u95ee\u8d23\u7b49\u77db\u76fe\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174AGI\u6cbb\u7406\u5e02\u573a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The concepts of blockchain opportunities and incompleteness of agri-food chain projects based on blockchain technology are then explained, setting out the minimum and necessary characteristics required to make the use of this technology useful and effective (Minimum Viable Ecosystem). The process governance levels for the development and maintenance of a blockchain traceability project are then illustrated, focusing on the role and responsibility of each player in the supply chain. Finally, the structure of a blockchain solution is described, focusing on a number of structural and technological solutions by outlining the concepts of consistency checking for the validation of input data with appropriate smart contracts, and of information frameworks for the subsequent scrutiny of data in audit operations and the assignment of levels of reliability. These are essential prerequisites for a collaborative blockchain data management to pursue the objective of actual reliability and transparency of information."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6f84\u6e05\u5173\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u5176\u5728\u98df\u54c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u519c\u4e1a\u98df\u54c1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u5b9e\u65bd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u884c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "research_question": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u98df\u54c1\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6b63\u786e\u5b9e\u65bd\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5173\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6f84\u6e05\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u89e3\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5728\u98df\u54c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u98df\u54c1\u9886\u57df\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u521b\u9020\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u7684\u98df\u54c1\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u884c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42\u7ea7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u9610\u8ff0\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6784\u5efa\u6765\u5206\u6790\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u98df\u54c1\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "findings": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u98df\u54c1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u884c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5305\u62ec\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u98df\u54c1\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u884c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u98df\u54c1\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6280\u672f\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

To evaluate decision criteria such as return-risk tradeoffs, they require probabilistic predictions-not just point estimates. However, many agents are either unwilling or unable to provide full probability distributions. In this article, we introduce a novel method that infers a probabilistic aggregate from agents' one-off point predictions. Specifically, each agent provides two point predictions, namely a direct prediction of the quantity of interest and a peer prediction of the average of the others' direct predictions. Our proposed conversion from point predictions to a probabilistic aggregate is straightforward: It has a closed-form solution, involves no tuning parameters, is efficient under the well-known normally distributed information structure, and outperforms benchmark methods across both synthetic and real-world data."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u540c\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u6027\u805a\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u4e0d\u613f\u6216\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u7684\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6027\u805a\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u62a5-\u98ce\u9669\u4ea4\u6362\u7b49\u51b3\u7b56\u5224\u65ad\uff1f", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u9700\u8981\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u56de\u62a5-\u98ce\u9669\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u65e0\u6cd5\u6216\u4e0d\u613f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u8bf7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u4e2a\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\uff1a\u5bf9\u5173\u6ce8\u91cf\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u7684\u540c\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6027\u805a\u5408\u3002", "findings": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u5728\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u63a8\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u6027\u805a\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u4e0d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u56de\u62a5-\u98ce\u9669\u4ea4\u6362\u7b49\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

The factors are estimated using category-specific personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data on prices and quantities, using a sign-restricted dynamic factor model that imposes theoretical predictions of the effects of fluctuations in supply and demand on prices and associated quantities through factor loadings. The resulting estimates are used to decompose total PCE inflation into contributions from common factors\u2014goods demand, goods supply, services demand, services supply, and inflation expectations\u2014and category specific idiosyncratic components. Validation exercises demonstrate that the estimated factors provide an informative and coherent narrative of inflation dynamics over time and can be effectively used for forecasting and policy analysis."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u9650\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fdPCE\u901a\u80c0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bc6\u522b\u5f62\u6210\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u5546\u54c1\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4ef7\u683c\u538b\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f9b\u7ed9\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u6761\u4ef6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f9b\u7ed9\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8ba1\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u80c0\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u9650\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f9b\u7ed9\u9700\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u6d88\u8d39\u652f\u51fa\uff08PCE\uff09\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u9650\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1", "findings": "\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u901a\u80c0\u52a8\u6001\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u603bPCE\u901a\u80c0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5546\u54c1\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u5546\u54c1\u4f9b\u7ed9\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u4f9b\u7ed9\u3001\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u4ef6", "theory_contributions": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u4f9b\u7ed9\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u6269\u5c55", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u653f\u7b56\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301"}}
