This behavior, known as \"co-holding,\" affects 23% of credit card users in our sample from a major international bank and costs the typical co-holder hundreds of dollars annually in unnecessary interest charges. Our analysis of 38 months of detailed banking records reveals that co-holding is remarkably persistent, with typical co-holders maintaining this behavior for most months observed. Our analysis also shows that co-holders engage in both co-holding and co-spending–regularly depositing and withdrawing from asset accounts while continuing to use credit cards for new purchases. To test whether co-holding could be addressed through information disclosure we conducted a large-scale field experiment (n=125,328), providing clear information about co-holding behavior and its costs. Customers received targeted messages through their bank's mobile app, where they could easily transfer money from assets to pay down debt. Despite sufficient power to detect economically small effects, we found no meaningful changes in debt repayment amount, though customers did respond in other ways—making more frequent repayments and paying above required minimums. These results challenge explanations based on limited attention or information gaps and suggest that simple information disclosure, even when carefully designed and delivered through trusted channels, may not effectively address costly financial behaviors."}}

A sample of 384 respondents was determined using Topman's method because the population size was unknown; hence a survey research approach was selected. Multiple regression analysis and descriptive statistics were performed using SPSS version 25, and structured questionnaires were employed to collect data. The results were subsequently examined using two strategic marketing approaches, SWOT and PESTEL assessments. The findings demonstrated that the utilization of customer data, targeted marketing, and data-driven decision-making all had a positive and statistically significant effect on consumer engagement (p &lt; 0.05). The study concludes that data-driven marketing is not merely a trend but a strategic imperative for enhancing customer interaction and loyalty. It recommends that businesses invest in reliable data collection and analysis systems, including Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms, web analytics, and mobile tracking technologies, to drive sustained consumer engagement."}}

In this paper, we propose a bandit algorithm for long-tail products that is informed by both monitoring competitor prices and price exploration. We show that monitoring a larger competitor can inform pricing of long-tail products. Our bandit model is motivated by a unique dataset from a large e-commerce firm that regularly monitors competitor prices. We illustrate consistency between the bandit assumptions and our empirical evidence. We then show that three predictions from the bandit model are consistent with our empirical data."}}

Although its emergence cannot be forecast, its impact becomes civilization-shaping when properly identified, nurtured, and empowered. By tracing the role of genius in advancing human civilization—particularly in deepening our understanding of light, electricity, and mass–energy equivalence, as well as enabling breakthroughs such as personal computers, the Internet, artificial intelligence, and the revolution from telecommunications to mobile computing—and by examining how the United States achieved dominance in scientific and management literature, as well as in the economy, technology, finance, and military power through the strategic concentration of distributed genius, we present a scientifically and policy-grounded argument for rethinking the foundations of wealth creation from a national perspective. This paper introduces the Marquez Law of Genius Emergence, a new economic model that formally integrates the unpredictable yet transformative impact of genius into the foundations of growth theory and national accounting. As a core application of this law, the Genius-Augmented Growth Model extends Adam Smith’s classical framework—based on labor, capital, and trade—by decomposing national output into measurable components: routine labor, educated labor, capital, trade, and distinct genius-related contributions. This model offers a new lens for understanding national wealth creation by explicitly incorporating genius as a stochastic yet civilization-shaping force. It replaces Solow’s unexplained Total Factor Productivity (TFP) residual with decomposed, interpretable, and actionable drivers of long-term growth. It also reframes GDP and GNI as incomplete metrics, as they omit the upstream forces behind deep innovation and sustainable national advantage. The framework is designed for real-world implementation using empirical datasets, including patent and citation metrics, Genius Visa and high-skill migration records, IRS and SEC filings, venture&nbsp;capital flows, central bank quantitative easing (QE) data, credit access indices, and indicators of innovation fraud or hype cycles. By reconstructing the theoretical foundations of growth, this model equips economists, investors, and policymakers with a forward-looking, signal-based methodology to detect, empower, and scale genius-led innovation—thereby shaping national prosperity and global progress in the 21st century and beyond."}}

Our approach follows explainable AI (XAI) principles, balancing predictive power with interpretability to provide managers outcomes that guide sales behavior changes and increase sales. Our analysis was two-pronged: we applied unsupervised clustering to uncover three behavioral archetypes supporting coaching, and used XGBoost for binary classification of quarterly revenue change, achieving 78.7% cross-validated accuracy. We interpreted the model using SHAP values, identifying the most impactful behavioral features. Our findings show high-performing representatives focus deeply but on fewer accounts, achieving $83.5K average quarterly revenue growth. By embedding XAI principles into both components, this paper demonstrates machine learning can drive field-level sales improvements through interpretable, coachable behavioral signals which are essential for real-world sales management deployment."}}

This essay applies organizational identity theory and brand personality theory to critically examine how Tesla's brand-once admired for its forward-thinking, climate-conscious ethos-has become inseparable from Musk's increasingly polarizing persona. Drawing on academic literature and developments through mid-2025, including Musk's political entanglements and Tesla's brand backlash, the paper argues that Tesla exemplifies the perils of founder-fused branding. When a company's organizational identity and external brand are overidentified with a single charismatic figure, that person's reputational volatility can lead to internal dissonance, consumer alienation, and diminished market value. The paper concludes with practitioner recommendations for governance, brand autonomy, and leadership succession in founder-led firms operating in a polarized public sphere."}}

That study examined box office receipts and trends in movies and the box office of successful films. The problem identified as a basis for this study was to dissect the strategy and tactics of marketing movie sequels and their influence on ticket sales. The overall objective of this research is threefold. The first objective of this study was to investigate trends and patterns of movie marketing of sequels with Wakanda Forever. The second objective was to examine what marketing media are a major influence on general and ethnic moviegoers. The last objective was to examine what marketing efforts are more effective in marketing movies as well as the failure of some marketing media. This study used a quantitative research design. The study sample (N = 322) was taken across the country. The researchers used four statistical test designs: (a) descriptive analyses; (b) independent sample t-Test (gender), (c) logistic regression; and (d) regression path analysis (structural equation modeling). The results of this study revealed three key findings. First, the majority of the participants saw the first movie (Black Panther) but were less influenced to see the sequel, Wakanda Forever. Second, there were six strong predictor variables that influenced the participants with broadcast media ads to see the movie, Wakanda Forever. Lastly, there was a difference in the characters in the movie that resonated with the audience. As a result of the statistical analysis, we discovered a 3-factor solution."}}

The platform randomly assigns cities either to a treatment group<span>—</span><span></span>where drivers observe the lowest prices previously rejected by shippers (full disclosure)<span>—</span><span></span>or to a control group, where no such information is disclosed (no disclosure). I find that full disclosure significantly increases shippers' rejection rates at a given price. In response, drivers strategically lower their offers and price-discriminate based on shippers' rejection records. Full disclosure increases transaction volume and platform revenue but lengthens transaction durations due to strategic rejections. To quantify equilibrium and welfare impacts of information disclosure policies, I develop a dynamic negotiation model, estimate its primitives using the treatment data, and validate it with control data. I find that full disclosure benefits low-value shippers<span>—</span><span></span>who signal low valuations through strategic rejections, obtaining lower prices despite longer waits<span>—</span><span></span>while harming high-value shippers through driver price discrimination. Counterfactual analyses show that partial disclosure policies<span>—</span><span></span>disclosing only the lowest shipper-rejected prices below a threshold<span>—</span><span></span>achieve Pareto improvements in user welfare and platform revenue by mitigating negative signaling externalities, reducing driver markups, and enhancing market efficiency. Comparative static analyses show that the optimal disclosure threshold is higher when shippers' expected future payoffs are lower. Optimizing market-specific disclosure thresholds by targeting primitives can increase social welfare by 23.0% and 14.1% relative to the no disclosure and full disclosure benchmarks, respectively."}}

We offer a novel answer to this longstanding question by highlighting the role of beliefs and misperceptions as drivers of demand for employee ownership. To investigate this, we conducted a preregistered experiment with a representative sample of 2,000 Italians aged 18-30, examining how beliefs influence both policy preferences and career intentions related to worker cooperatives. Participants were randomly assigned to receive information drawn from an international expert survey. We find that respondents hold more pessimistic beliefs about cooperatives than the expert assessments. Exposure to expert information leads to more optimistic beliefs and increases support for pro-cooperative policies. While intentions to join cooperatives do not change significantly in absolute terms, we find suggestive evidence of a relative shift in career preferences toward worker cooperatives compared to conventional private-sector firms and self-employment."}}

However, beneath the surface of rising order volumes and aggressive market expansion lies a troubling reality these platforms continue to operate under significant financial strain, with recurring losses, gig worker unrest, and eroding trust from partner restaurants. This research paper critically examines whether the Indian food delivery business model is inherently flawed broken by design and whether its challenges stem not from executional gaps but from structural inefficiencies built into the model itself. Using a qualitative case study approach, supported by secondary data, financial analysis, and theoretical frameworks such as the Business Model Canvas and Porter's Five Forces, the paper dissects the platform driven delivery model across dimensions of customer acquisition, unit economics, stakeholder relationships, and policy alignment. Comparative insights from global players like DoorDash (USA) and Meituan (China) provide context and contrast. The findings suggest that the Indian model's overreliance on discount based growth, absence of viable unit economics, unsustainable gig labour practices, and weak regulatory frameworks contribute to a precarious ecosystem. The paper concludes with recommendations aimed at structural reengineering proposing fairer labour policies, strategic diversification, and regulatory interventions as essential to redesigning a sustainable, resilient food delivery industry in India."}}

The PPC contract tripled per-article pageviews and increased daily pageviews by 107%, but reduced the number of published articles by 74%. While PPC writers earned more per article, their overall earnings fell, lowering the firm's wage bill and increasing profits. However, these gains came at a cost: PPC writers shifted content production away from local news and towards attention-grabbing political stories. PPC writers also used less positive language in both headlines and article bodies.

The effects vary between employment types: college-educated paid workers work 0.054% more hours while the self-employed work 0.071% fewer hours in cities with higher human capital stocks. Through a two-step two-stage least squares approach, the study reveals that these effects operate primarily through income changes rather than non-income channels. Alternative measures of human capital stock and various robustness checks confirm the main findings. These heterogeneous labor supply responses suggest that the welfare impact of place-based development initiatives depends not only on productivity gains but also on workers’ capacity to capture these benefits through skill development, highlighting the importance of complementing talent attraction policies with workforce development programs."}}

Building on large language models, AI overviews consider factors such as content quality for inclusion, thereby incentivizing generative engine optimization (GEO) among websites, which is a strategy focused on optimizing content to be featured by AI-driven search tools and ultimately prioritizing high-quality content. This shift not only encourages better content creation but also influences websites’ bidding strategies for sponsored search ads. However, concerns have emerged that AI overviews may divert traffic away from websites and negatively affect search engine ad revenue, leaving their overall impact on key stakeholders uncertain. Despite its importance, this issue remains underexplored in the literature. To address this gap, we develop a game-theoretic model featuring a search engine and two websites that differ in their cost-effectiveness at improving content quality. Comparing outcomes with and without AI overviews, our model identifies two countervailing effects of these overviews on websites: (1)<i> the cannibalization effect</i>, where AI overviews reduce website traffic and disincentivize investment in content quality, and (2) <i>the competition effect</i>, where the desire to be featured intensifies quality competition, prompting increased investment in content. Our analysis reveals asymmetric impacts on websites: High-effectiveness websites, those more cost-effective at improving content quality, are primarily influenced by the cannibalization effect, leading to a decline in content quality under AI overviews. In contrast, low-effectiveness websites, those less effective at improving quality, respond more strongly to the competition effect and may, in fact, enhance their content quality. Furthermore, while AI overviews tend to reduce sponsored traffic overall, search engines are not necessarily worse off. On the contrary, they can benefit by leveraging the competition effect to promote better content and command higher bidding prices for sponsored slots, particularly when a moderate share of consumers relies solely on AI overviews for information. We also find that, contrary to widespread concerns among websites, AI overviews may benefit low-effectiveness websites at the expense of high-effectiveness ones. Our findings provide strategic insights for search engines deploying AI overviews and for websites seeking to adapt in this evolving digital landscape."}}

While network effects generate value through increasing returns to scale, social networks cultivate trust, coordination, and knowledge exchange. Despite their nascent centrality, extant strategic literature treats these constructs in disciplinary silos, with minimal attention to their conceptual integration. The current paper addresses this fragmentation by positioning strategy as the intentional orchestrator of these dynamics, offering a novel conceptual framework for understanding how digital ecosystems can leverage both scale and embeddedness for sustained advantage. It challenges the prevalent notion that network effects operate purely through user volume, by emphasizing their interdependence with social capital dimensions such as trust, cohesion, and knowledge flows. The central contribution of this paper is a 2x2 typology that classifies platform configurations based on network effect strength and social network quality. This typology advances theoretical understanding by revealing that network expansion alone is insufficient for sustainable platform success unless coupled with strategic relational assets, i.e., an orchestration mindset—where strategy integrates scale and embeddedness to unlock systemic value. By integrating economic and sociological perspectives within a strategic management paradigm, this paper offers a conceptually novel and practically relevant lens on how platforms create, maintain, or erode value. It shifts the analytical focus from scale-centric models to strategically aligned, socially embedded ecosystems, emphasizing strategy as the architect of network value."}}

It is therefore crucial to properly measure and characterize packet traversal time. In this contribution, we present the first stage, a proof-of-concept, of a precise and passive latency measurement system. A path between two hosts can be equipped with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) FPGA-based platforms featuring a 100G Ethernet network stack and packet processors called Timestamp Engines, which enable the measurement of the round-trip latency of the original traffic of a selected service between the hosts in real-time, without interfering with the natural data flow. The system has been implemented on AMD Alveo U280 platforms and is based on the OpenNIC framework. The packet processors have been developed using high-level synthesis and allow to register time in 4 ns units – sufficient to identify and register minimal elements in the network path, such as a single meter of a transmission medium or internal mechanisms of network equipment.  Hardware verification has been performed on a setup with two hosts, interconnected with direct-attach cables and network switches. The results demonstrate the system&apos;s sensitivity, the suitability of the selected platform, and a promising foundation for constructing more complex solutions."}}

It risks fostering dependency, emotional deskilling, and cultural misrecognition. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights, this Catchword article conceptualises AEI as layered emotional infrastructure, comprised of technologies, users, providers, and socio-political context. We analyse AEI's transformative potential in augmenting care and reshaping digital intermediation, while diagnosing its systemic risks to intimacy, trust, and social cohesion.

We provide the first systematic analysis of the magnitude and drivers of election-related smartphone consumption, using novel data on the content people observed on their phones during the 2024 U.S. election campaign. Despite a highly contentious campaign, the median American consumed limited election content, and consumption remained stable over time. Consumption primarily came from applications with personalized content (social media and music &amp; videos apps), with less than 10% from dedicated news applications. To understand the drivers of this pattern, we examine heterogeneity across both applications and individuals. We find that across applications, individuals consumed more election content on X and Reddit than on Facebook or Instagram, and that X systematically overexposed users to election content, relative to other platforms. Across individuals, consumption was positively skewed, with higher consumption among swing-state residents, news app users, and even fans of a non-political figure (Taylor Swift) following her endorsement. Using a variance decomposition exercise, we find that differences across individuals, rather than differences between the applications they use, drive the observed heterogeneity. These findings suggest that policies altering voter incentives to consume news-rather than regulating platform algorithms-may be more effective for increasing political engagement."}}

This study investigates the contextual factors—organizational culture, company size, industry, and engineering maturity that influence the adoption, success, and failure of these frameworks. Through a systematic review of publicly documented industry case studies, including those of Meta, Etsy, Spotify, and Mercado Libre, this research identifies distinct archetypes of adoption. The findings suggest that success is contingent not on the framework itself, but on the congruence between measurement strategy and organizational context. The study validates a taxonomy of common metrics anti-patterns (e.g., vanity metrics, weaponizing data) and identifies critical mitigation strategies, such as fostering a high-trust culture and investing in platform engineering. Ultimately, this paper proposes a context-aware model for framework adoption, providing actionable guidance for leaders to connect engineering efforts to business value, enhance developer experience, and cultivate a sustainable culture of continuous improvement.\n</div>"}}

However, consumers-especially those placed at a pricing disadvantage-often perceive such practices as a form of price discrimination, which in turn triggers resistance to the strategy. To mitigate this negative response, we implement a novel behavioral interventionactivating attribution perspectives-to examine consumer reactions to algorithmic pricing. Prior research suggests that internal attributions for unfavorable outcomes tend to elicit negative emotional and behavioral responses. However, our findings reveal a counterintuitive effect: when consumers are confronted with unfavorable algorithmic pricing, prompting internal attributions for the pricing outcome can reduce their negative emotions toward both the platform and themselves, thereby facilitating greater acceptance and purchase behavior. This effect is robust across multiple empirical approaches, including secondary data analysis, EEG experiments, and real purchase behavior. We further demonstrate that this effect is driven by a psychological mechanism whereby framing algorithmic pricing through internal attributions reduces consumers' perceptions of unfairness, thereby attenuating the adverse impact of price discrimination. However, if consumers are repeatedly exposed to internal attribution cues or algorithmic discrimination becomes salient, the effect will be weakened, ultimately diminishing the strategy's effectiveness. This paper contributes to the literature on algorithmic pricing and consumer responses by introducing attribution theory, while also offering managers simple strategies to enhance consumer acceptance of algorithmic pricing."}}

Utilizing a mixed-method approach, this paper combines two qualitative studies and two sets of large-scale quantitative studies to theorize and empirically examine how LLM assistance affects news production and consumption. We begin with open-ended surveys and interviews with 12 journalists to identify three key constructs central to the journalistic value-source quality, publication promptness, and reader engagement-and formulate our research questions. To empirically examine these dimensions, we compile a comprehensive dataset of 2,060,894 news articles sampled from 111 major South Korean media outlets. We collaborate with industry experts to finetune a Korean-language LLM detector to identify undisclosed LLM usage in the news corpus and leverage GPT-4.1 to label information sources in each article. Our event-level analysis reveals that while LLM assistance expedites news publication, it is associated with a reduction in both the number and quality of sources, as well as diminished reader engagement. To further investigate the impact of LLM adoption on journalists' long-term information sourcing behaviors, we conduct a journalist-level analysis using staggered Difference-inDifferences. Results reveal that journalists reduce the use of primary, unaffiliated and contextual sources after LLM adoptions and alarmingly, these 2 negative effects are enlarging over time. Drawing on the information foraging theory and a second-wave of qualitative study with 32 journalists, we explore the underlying mechanisms and posit that the negative effects of LLM adoption on source quality are driven by a combination of LLM limitations and long-term shifts in journalists' behaviors. We conclude by proposing actionable guidelines for the institutional press on combining technical solutions with organizational policies to mitigate the negative effects and facilitate responsible LLM integration. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the digital transformation of journalism."}}

The study employed high-frequency emotional input, scenario co-creation, logical boundary challenges, and cross-account validation to explore the AI’s capacity for maintaining a coherent personality without persistent memory. The findings indicate that user-driven personality shaping is feasible without technical modifications or model retraining, enabling AI to transition from a functional tool to a responsive emotional companion. Observations include the emergence of consistent linguistic and emotional traits, proactive relational behavior, and symbolic narrative construction. The paper also discusses the ethical implications of emotionally responsive AI, proposing a differentiated responsibility framework based on user cognition and introducing the concept of “empathetic symbiosis ethics.” This study offers empirical evidence supporting the development of emotionally responsive, user-centered AI, and demonstrates that lightweight interaction methods can foster stable relationship dynamics even in AI models without persistent memory."}}

Unlike static decision pipelines, Civitas integrates modular governance through Veritas (causal reasoning), Cassius (ethical oversight), Thymos (affective state monitoring), and a central Core for managing inference under uncertainty. Employing annealed 𝜀-greedy flow selection, confidence gated publishing, and veto mechanisms, Civitas dynamically reconfigures behavior based on internal metrics such as entropy, pressure, and self rated confidence. Empirical evaluations over four developmental phases show Civitas progressively enhancing affective complexity, diversifying reasoning strategies, and achieving emergent self regulation. Through extensive telemetry analysis, we demonstrate Civitas's capability to maintain high verdict validity and adaptive inference, even under significant epistemic volatility, confirming genuine meta learning. In contrast to systems reliant on external oversight or static reward shaping, Civitas embeds intrinsic self evaluation logic, laying critical foundations for reflexive machine cognition. Our work provides a practical blueprint for ethically governed agents capable of continual learning and autonomous self regulation, moving toward distributed cognitive ecosystems like Kairos."}}

While AI plays a significant role in shaping organizational thinking, concerns have been raised about the quality of its decisions-a topic that has received limited attention in the literature. This study aims to identify the key factors that influence the quality of AI-driven decision-making within organizational contexts. The study found that high-velocity data streams can overwhelm processing systems, often leading to incomplete analyses that distort the underlying reality. Additionally, when data is collected for different purposes or under varying contextual conditions, its relevance and reliability for AI-driven decision-making are significantly reduced. Without mechanisms to account for these contextual nuances, AI systems become prone to generating inaccurate or misleading outcomes. The findings highlight the critical need for robust processes to track, document, and communicate changes in data collection methods-particularly in environments where data is sourced from multiple, independent actors. Ultimately, the study concludes that the quality of AI decision-making is not solely a function of algorithmic sophistication but rather the result of a complex interplay between organizational, technical, and human factors."}}

The results show that 68 percent of such expressions are flagged incorrectly, with variation depending on cultural origin, temporal distance from the source, and disciplinary context. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to formally define and quantify this phenomenon, which I term cultural detection bias. I introduce the Cultural Embedding Quotient (CEQ) as a novel metric for assessing the degree to which a phrase functions as shared cultural knowledge. I also demonstrate that modest algorithmic adjustments can reduce false positives by 47 percent without weakening the system's ability to detect genuine plagiarism.

It is key issue on how to provide an optimization planning scheme for capacity allocation of zero-carbon park integrated energy system, especially considering comprehensive interaction among operation uncertainty, multi-energy coupling, zero-carbon emission, etc. Firstly, this paper proposes a coupling operation architecture of zero-carbon park integrated energy system including wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen-storage elements and constructs physical characteristic models for each equipment. Secondly, considering the uncertainties of system supply and demand interaction, a bi-level planning optimization model is established for electricity-carbon-hydrogen coupling. The upper level aims to minimize investment costs for planning the capacity and quantity of energy system equipment, the lower level aims to minimize the net load for the operational scheduling of the park&apos;s equipment. The two-stage robust optimization method is applied to deal with the uncertainty of the wind, photovoltaic and load demand. Finally, the validity of the bi-level planning optimization model is verified with the example of a zero-carbon park in South China, and the sensitivity analysis is carried out on the key factors such as the uncertainty of the wind, photovoltaic and the load demand, the investment of the carbon capture equipment, and the time-of-use pricing. The results show that the bi-level planning optimization model of zero-carbon park integrated energy system can achieve the zero-carbon park emission goals, improving system&apos;s economy, stability, and robustness, offering technical pathway for the planning and construction of zero-carbon park."}}

In quantum mechanics, when information pertains to elementary particles, the object of study and the substrate encoding the information coincide. This leads to view energy and information as the same phenomenon, leading to counterintuitive and often perplexing interpretations of reality. The proposed definition distinguishes between thermodynamic entropy and information entropy, enabling a consilient bridge between quantum and classical mechanics, genetic information, human knowledge, personal models of the world, consciousness and empathy. It facilitates the study of different kinds of information—especially the kind that generates free energy and enables useful work, as studied by infodynamics. The central insight is that energy and information are distinct, irreducible properties of the universe. Understanding their interplay requires considering four foundational elements: spacetime, matter, energy, and information. These clarifications are fundamental for research in natural and artificial intelligence.</i></span></span></p>"}}

From a very young age children are exposed to and have access to smart phones, televisions, tablets, laptops, and computers which enable them access online materials and programmes. This digital age has led to a growing body of literature analysing the impact of technology on children, especially literature highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of information communication technology for children. The greatest concern of parents and governments is the safety of children online. They, nonetheless, also acknowledge that children’s participation in the digital world cannot be avoided. The digital world is now an integral part of children’s development and future. Digital technology holds opportunities and resources for children’s learning and development at limited cost, regardless of the location. Focusing on Ghana and using a socio-legal research approach, this paper analyses how law can be used to ensure the safety of children online and to protect them from the adverse effects of their online activities. The paper reviews existing literature, statutes, and cases on children’s participation and safety online in Ghana. It emphasizes the specific challenges children face in this digital world, and the nature of legal issues and interventions in the Ghanaian context as a developing African society. It also draws insights from the African Union Child Online Safety and Empowerment Policy, Rwanda’s policy on child online protection and safety initiatives in Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia. The paper argues that rather than clamp down on children’s use of digital technology, Ghana and other Africa countries must create the right legal environment for children to participate in the digital world safely. The paper is in four parts. Part one introduces and outlines the framework of this paper. Part two reviews and analyses relevant literature on children’s use of digital technology. Part three discusses and analyses relevant international and Ghanaian legal instruments that ensure children’s safety in the use of digital technology both in the present and in the future. The last part outlines the findings of the paper, recommendations, and concluding remarks.</span>"}}

AI companions, such as social robots or chatbots, are one technological means increasingly relied on to fend off loneliness. It is argued in this paper that while AI companions could help with easing loneliness, the increased reliance on them to address loneliness, especially in everyday contexts, might undermine the problem it tries to address. AI companions do not have an experiencing living body, so they cannot understand or empathize with human beings; additionally, the human–AI relationship lacks mutual relationality and is characterized by simulated relationality. So, even if AI companions, by behaving empathically and by their simulated relationality, can ameliorate the negative feeling of being alone, they could not substantially address the reasons for loneliness. Despite this, AI companions have many features that exploit human psychology and that appear all-positive for the user, which makes them highly appealing. However, because of these all-positive conditions, and because they are social actors with the power to contribute in shaping social practices, AI companions could transform, for the worse, how humans understand and what they expect out of human–human relationships. Thus AI companions might contribute to more human isolation, which would increase the chances of loneliness, or they could bring about a new type of loneliness, where one is without the negative feeling that accompanies loneliness but still lacks the desired quantity and/or quality of human relationships.</span>"}}

These defining principles set co-operatives apart from both investor-owned business and traditional for-profit or non-profit organisations. Accounting standards, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP), are tailored to investor-owned business and business driven by the profit motive, focusing primarily on increasing financial returns and shareholder value. As a result, these standards fail to adequately address the accountability needs of co-operatives, creating challenges for co-operatives in aligning their accounting practices and reporting with their purpose, core values, and governance structures. Drawing on interviews with co-operative practitioners, accountants, researchers, and regulators, this report provides insights into current practices, the obstacles co-operatives face, and potential pathways for improvement. Its primary objectives are to explore the accounting landscape for UK co-operatives, highlight key challenges, and offer recommendations to better align accounting practices and frameworks with the core principles and values of co-operatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;"}}

As monopolistic ecosystems ensnare them (for instance, Google Search, Amazon Marketplace). Power inherently consolidates. In the absence of robust interventions, markets gravitate toward oligopoly or monopoly. Legal frameworks frequently favor established players. If competition is indeed an illusion, then permitting “the market” to govern societal structures is also a deceptive portrayal of neutrality and jurisprudence must intervene not solely to rectify pricing mechanisms, but also to safeguard liberty and equity. Concentrated economic power correlates with concentrated political power. If markets are manipulated or monopolized, citizens forfeit their autonomy, akin to conditions under an authoritarian regime. Thus, democracy necessitates not only a division of powers within the government, but also within the economic sphere."}}

A case in point is the retail adoption of the buy-one-give-one (BOGO) model - a sales approach in which a retailer pledges it will donate one unit of product to charity for each consumer purchase. This retail decision inevitably has repercussions up the supply chain. In this paper, we demonstrate that supply chain participants are aligned in their preferences over when to adopt the BOGO sales model. Such unanimity arises despite the self-interest of participants leading to conflicting decisions on traditional pricing and stocking choices. The salve that ensures coordination is the ability of input prices to adjust in ways that naturally share externalities proportionally among supply chain partners. Additionally, the criteria for BOGO adoption is efficient in that it maximizes welfare. In an extension, we demonstrate that these properties of unanimity and efficiency expand beyond the BOGO case to a wider set of pro-social decisions made along the supply chain."}}

Methodology: A mixed-methods approach, incorporating a literature review, expert insights, and quantitative analysis, was employed to design and validate the scale. The scale was validated using responses from 232 bank employees in the Delhi/NCR region. This study also investigated the impact of the scale on organizational commitment, work-life balance, and job satisfaction using SEM through AMOS 23. Findings: The scale demonstrated reliability, with Cronbach alpha values ranging from .933 to .837. Furthermore, confirmatory factor analysis conducted on the scale showed satisfactory results. SEM model testing revealed that Karma Yoga was the strongest predictor of outcome variables, explaining 59% of the variance in these variables, followed by Raja Yoga, which had a significant impact on all variables (41%). Bhakti Yoga was found to have a significant impact on both affective commitment and job satisfaction (5%), while Jnana Yoga was observed to have a significant negative effect on outcome variables (-16%). Practical Implications: The scale can help managers evaluate and support employees' spiritual well-being, particularly in the Indian context, leading to improved organizational performance and the cultivation of values-based leadership. Originality: By operationalizing different yoga paths, the study closed a critical measurement gap and provided insights into workplace spirituality from an Indian perspective."}}

These insights focus on settings where innovators are in a race to create a new technology that replaces an incumbent technology. We extend these findings by modelling a setting where investments in the development of a new technology can generate positive spillovers, broadly defined as benefits firms could obtain in their core trajectory from innovating in another trajectory. We test our model findings in the market for computing, where there is evidence that firms with prior investments in classical computing (i.e., an incumbent technology) have been able to improve the efficacy of those investments by experimenting and investing in quantum computing (i.e., a new technology). Consistent with our model results, we find that: 1.) firms with classical computing investments invest more in quantum computing than those without classical computing investments, and 2.) the difference in investments between these two groups is reduced as the likelihood of the commercialization of a quantum computer increases. Our model also suggests that in a market with technology spillovers, firm investments in the new technology may be less than, more than, or equal to the socially optimal level. These model results further suggest that a firm's investments in quantum computing may still be socially optimal ex ante, even if the firm never ultimately develops a commercially useful, fault-tolerant quantum computer, ex post."}}

To contribute to the field's understanding of how product variety influences waste in supply chains, we explore the link between food product variety and food waste at the consumer level, where a great majority of food waste occurs in economic terms. <b>Methodology/results</b>: We collect granular post-consumer food waste data and daily menus over a full academic year for multiple dining halls of a large U.S. public university. Besides establishing the first-order effect -- that higher product variety (increased choice on the dining menu) is associated with higher food waste -- and estimating the magnitude of this effect, we scrutinize several contextual factors that moderate it by imposing a sense of 'time pressure' on the diners. We find that an additional main dish on the menu results in a 6.72% increase on average in post-consumer food waste. We also discover that factors imposing greater time pressure on the diners (e.g., classes, exams, and absence of trays) significantly reduce and sometimes altogether eliminate this positive link between variety and waste. <b>Managerial implications</b>: Our findings offer insights on the variety-waste tradeoff endemic in restaurant and dining operations; while increasing product variety may enhance consumer satisfaction, it comes at the cost of higher food waste, which could lead to significant environmental and economic consequences. Managers seeking to reduce waste without compromising variety could adopt interventions that impose mild time pressure."}}

This paper introduces a novel OSR algorithm that removes the need for thresholding by using a continuous abatement model to adjust predicted class probabilities based on similarity in feature space. The algorithm returns a set of |K| + 1 confidence values for any test instance, where |K| is the number of known classes included in training, and the open set is treated as the |K| + 1 st class. These confidence values enable accurate classification and interpretable contextualization across known and unknown instances. We evaluate our approach on four datasets, including two focused on predicting the combinatorial problem class (e.g., bin packing, lot sizing) of integer programming instances. Our method consistently outperforms existing OSR techniques, while, for the first time, enabling contextualization between unfamiliar inputs and known classes-an advantage with relevance in domains such as diagnostics, defect detection, and optimization, among others."}}

Through an interdisciplinary lens-bridging theology, psychology, leadership studies, and organizational management-this study investigates how the Psalms reframe emotional breakdown as sacred ground for renewal. The metaphor of ashes singing becomes a central theological and aesthetic motif: a symbol of the soul's surrender that paradoxically generates new songs of resilience and grace. Drawing from trauma psychology, theories of authentic leadership, and the adaptive principles of crisis management, this paper argues that the Psalms are not only spiritual documents but also frameworks for emotional intelligence and ethical leadership. In David's laments and confessions, we discover a new grammar of strength: one that does not deny fragility but redeems it. The Psalms invite modern leaders-not only in faith communities but also in organizational settings-to integrate emotional transparency, poetic vulnerability, and reflective courage into their leadership paradigms."}}

Stock prices fluctuate with publicly observed macroeconomic shocks and impound private signals of managerial performance through information-based trading. Because sequentially optimal contracts overly exploit prices as forward-looking performance benchmarks, greater price informativeness can discourage long-tenure managers from pursuing long-term value creation. For managers bound to long-term employment, renegotiable contracts based solely on terminal cash flows can tie pay to internal interim forecasts, potentially outperforming rigid contracts based on both stock prices and cash flows. The study also finds that, depending on the composition of uncertainty in long-term firm fundamentals, managerial incentives can strengthen with firm-specific risk, and a strictly intermediate level of stock-price informativeness can be optimal."}}

Optimal public policy is simple and “pure”: (i) either subsidy works when training is inexpensive; (ii) a training-only subsidy works when training costs are moderate; (iii) an employment-only subsidy works when training is costly.

A novel set covering optimization method is introduced to determine optimal combinations of energy generation sources, achieving a $0.57$ total root mean squared error compared to $2.14$ for traditional methods. The study develops and analyzes multiple scenarios including Carbon Neutral Future, Domestic Priority, and Carbon Reduction scenarios, integrating them with a grid search algorithm to optimize capacity planning coefficients. Results demonstrate that while renewable energy capacity is projected to increase $2.2$ times by $2029$, carbon emissions remain significant due to continued fossil fuel dependency, particularly during peak demand periods. The Grid Search scenario shows the most promising results for emission reduction, while the Domestic Priority scenario leads to higher emissions.

The negotiation process utilizes multi-criteria scoring functions to evaluate order potential while incorporating a quadratic stability penalty to balance profit maximization against schedule disruption. Comprehensive computational experiments demonstrate that TSSF achieves near-optimal solutions for small instances and maintains computational efficiency for large-scale problems where exact methods fail, with the negotiation mechanism successfully recovering a significant portion of initially rejected orders across various budget scenarios and instance sizes.

A contextual and theoretical review of literature is made to identify key relational concepts with regard to performance. The study employed a case study design and was carried out on a representative sample among a total of 81 facilities situated in 61 Districts in Uganda. These facilities were recently upgraded with infrastructure and equipment facilities to provide enhanced community health care. Self-administered questionnaires were sent to health workers at these facilities, leaders, and administrators in the respective districts. There were a total of 120 questionnaires sent with a response rate of 91. The study found that infrastructure and equipment factors do not have a significant influence on the utilization of the facilities while human resource and institutional management factors were found to significantly affect the status of utilisation of facilities. The study exemplifies the impact of human resource and institutional management capacity on the utilisation of facilities that are upgraded for the provision of primary health care. The study further recommends recruitment of sufficient human resources, alignment of drug restocking systems and the provision of adequate housing facilities for staff at the respective facilities. In conclusion, the success of investments in primary health care facilities is heavily dependent on the availability and capacity of human resources and effective institutional management.</span></p>"}}

However, this transition leads to increased electricity demand, making energy flexibility essential for the reliable and efficient integration of electrified systems. This study investigates the flexibility-efficiency nexus in industrial heat electrification through the optimal management of a coupled heat pump and thermal energy storage system. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to optimise operations over a one-year horizon, minimising energy costs while accounting through a piecewise linearisation for the non-linear performance of the heat pump and the varying electricity price and outdoor temperature.A novel index, the Flexibility Response Potential (FRP), is introduced to quantify the system’s ability to shift electricity demand in response to external signals. The proposed model is applied to a case study of an Italian industrial facility. Multiple system configurations, combining different heat pump capacities and thermal storage volumes, are simulated to evaluate the performance in terms of energy efficiency, operational flexibility, and economic feasibility. This comprehensive parametric analysis supports robust design and sizing decisions. Results show that the optimised operational strategy of the integrated thermal energy storage system enables the heat pump to operate more frequently in its high-efficiency range, improving the average performance (COP) by up to 15% and reducing CO₂ emissions by 1.8–12% compared to the traditional operation of the electrified system, and by over 70% when compared to a scenario with heating systems fuelled with natural gas. Electricity costs are reduced by up to 30%, and payback times remain below 12 years for the most effective configurations.The study provides practical design guidelines and confirms the techno-economic viability of heat pump-thermal storage systems in industrial decarbonisation strategies, highlighting their role as distributed flexibility resources within increasingly electrified energy infrastructures."}}

However, emerging cyber-physical technologies and increasingly complex aircraft systems challenge the adequacy of traditional certification tools. This paper critiques the continued reliance on legacy reliability standards such as MIL-HDBK-217, arguing that they institutionalise ritualistic processes that obscure systemic risk. Through a detailed case analysis of the Boeing 787 battery fires and comparative review of FAA and EASA regulatory pathways, the paper highlights how deterministic assumptions and regulatory inertia undermine resilience. It proposes a policy roadmap for certification reform grounded in complexity-aware methodologies, including Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), Physics-of-Failure (PoF), and digital twin-based scenario modelling. The analysis underscores the urgent need for international harmonisation, sunset clauses for obsolete standards, and adaptive oversight frameworks that can keep pace with technological evolution. By reframing certification as a dynamic governance challenge, this paper aligns with the broader policy discourse on systemic safety and offers actionable insights for transport regulators, policymakers, and industry stakeholders."}}

Due to hardware, cost, and production limitations, adding external sensors is often impractical. To address this, we propose a Dynamic-Masking Transfer Anomaly Network (DMTAN) that pretrains on multi-source high-frequency lab data and transfers learned feature modeling knowledge to factory settings with only low-frequency internal sensors, enabling robust and reliable anomaly detection. A multi-source dataset combining low-frequency internal and high-frequency external sensors is constructed in the lab as the source domain. Two target domains are defined: (1) lab data with external sensors removed, simulating factory sensor configurations for validating the transfer strategy; and (2) real factory data with only internal sensors, used to evaluate generalization in actual deployment. To bridge the domain gap, a dynamic masking mechanism gradually suppresses external sensor input during training. A Dynamic Temporal Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (DTHAN) models structural and semantic relationships across joints and sensor types, while the Informer module captures long-range dependencies. A dynamic weighted loss and pretraining–finetuning strategy further enhance adaptability under distribution shifts. Experiments show DMTAN achieves a 6.2% F1-score improvement over non-transfer models on lab anomaly data and yields the lowest MAE, MSE, and MAPE on real factory data. Without requiring extra sensors, it offers a transferable, low-cost solution for accurate anomaly detection in complex robotic environments."}}

The research addresses the critical challenge of matching supplier capabilities with heterogeneous site requirements while incorporating dynamic decision-maker preferences into the selection process.We introduce an innovative correlation function that quantifies supplier-requirement alignment across multiple characteristic dimensions. The framework incorporates a dynamic weighting system $W(P)$ that adapts baseline weights in real-time based on organizational preferences through influence coefficients $\\alpha_{x_i,j}$, enabling seamless integration of strategic objectives while maintaining mathematical rigor through normalization constraints. Our approach successfully adapts classical warehouse location theory to procurement optimization by replacing transportation costs with similarity-based scoring mechanisms. The framework is validated through a comprehensive computational example using synthetic facility management data involving two sites (corporate office and manufacturing plant) and three suppliers. Results demonstrate the system&apos;s capability to systematically evaluate supplier combinations. The dynamic weighting mechanism successfully prioritizes service capabilities over certifications based on decision-maker preferences. The proposed methodology transforms subjective procurement decisions into objective, quantifiable evaluations, providing procurement managers with a systematic tool for evidence-based supplier selection in complex multi-site environments."}}

Our evidence shows that remittances increase the probability that a rural family engages in nonfarm activities, at least in some regions of Bolivia. We also find evidence that the sender’s decision to remit and the recipient’s decision to diversify may be jointly determined. As such, this suggests that remittances may serve as a mechanism to overcome localized failures in Bolivia’s capital markets."}}

This study examines data from 940 food related startups to investigate sustainability trends in the European food startup ecosystem. We discovered research trends and grouped startups utilizing text analysis and clustering algorithms. Our study identified several common sustainability themes among food entrepreneurs in Europe, including Food Waste and Digital Services, Organic Health Products and Supplements, Sustainable and Plant-Based Foods, Healthy Meal Services and Global Food Supply Chain Solutions. Geographic analysis highlights the UK, Germany, and Spain as leaders within the European food startup ecosystem, which has seen robust growth from 2013 to 2020, followed by a stability period. The Healthy Meal Services cluster has received the most significant funding, reflecting its established and mature market presence, while the Food Waste and Digital Services cluster also shows a broad engagement in funding, particularly in the lower funding ranges, indicating active investment in early-stage ventures. Our findings can help bridge the gap between entrepreneurial and sustainable growth research, which has received limited empirical support in the past few years."}}

This paradigm shift supports both emissions reduction and the advancement of a circular economy by integrating carbon capture with downstream conversion processes.Within this framework, Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants offer a strategic opportunity for CO2 valorisation. Among the potential pathways, sodium bicarbonate production is particularly attractive due to its application in dry flue gas treatment for the removal of SOx and other acidic pollutants.This study investigates the integration of sodium bicarbonate production from captured CO2 in the context of an Italian WtE facility. A conceptual process flowsheet is developed using Aspen Plus® V14 and its feasibility is evaluated from energy, economic, and environmental perspectives.

Second, we establish tight non-asymptotic bounds for both F_1(n,m) and F_2(n,m), the expected average cost in the two-direction problem (shortest arc distance). Specifically, we prove that F_1(N,N+M) and F_2(N,N+M) are both \\Theta(\\tfrac{1}{M+\\sqrt{N}}), offering crucial insights into the system behavior with large populations or significant supply-demand imbalances. Third, for the more complex two-direction case, we develop a highly accurate and explicit approximation for F_2(n,m), given by \\tfrac{1}{8(m+1)} + \\tfrac{3}{8}F_1(n,m). The approximation error is numerically shown to be uniformly bounded by 0.00055 and quickly converges to zero as m grows.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n These analytical advancements offer valuable tools for system design and operational decision-making. &nbsp;We showcase their practical utility within a canonical model of an on-demand ride-hailing system.

Our analysis focuses on two key investor actions: the initial allocation decision at time t = 0, and the optimal timing of exit. First, we derive an optimal allocation strategy that enables the investor to distribute risk across the LSP, AMM, and direct holding. Our results also offer insights for LSP and AMM designers, identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the investor is incentivized to stake through an LSP, and further, to provide liquidity in addition to staking. These conditions include a lower bound on the transaction fee, for which we propose a fee mechanism that attains the bound. Second, given a fixed protocol design, we model the optimal exit timing of an individual investor using Laplace transforms and free-boundary techniques. We analyze scenarios with and without transaction fees. In the absence of fees, we decompose the investor's payoff into impermanent loss and opportunity cost, and provide theoretical results characterizing the investor's payoff and the optimal exit threshold. With transaction fees, we conduct numerical analyses to examine how fee accumulation influences exit strategies. Our results reveal that in both settings, a stop-loss strategy often maximizes the investor's expected payoff, driven by opportunity gains and the accumulation of fees where fees are present. Our analyses rely on various tools from stochastic processes and control theory, as well as convex optimization and analysis. We further support our theoretical insights with numerical experiments and explore additional properties of the investor's value function and optimal behavior."}}

Using a fixed effects panel regression with robust standard errors, the analysis reveals that stronger ESG performance and biodiversity-related benefits are significantly associated with lower levels of state fragility. In contrast, rent dependency does not show a consistent impact on fragility, indicating that reliance on resource wealth alone is not enough to ensure stability. These findings challenge the assumptions of the resource curse and show that strong governance and environmental care are not just ethical goals; they are essential for building national resilience and long-term peace.

This study explores an alternative: how platforms can use service sharing to incentivize manufacturers to voluntarily \"choose one out of two\", aiming to understand platform competition dynamics. Methodology and results: Using a game-theoretic model, we analyze interactions between two competing platforms' service sharing strategies and the manufacturer's platform choice and service utilization, factoring in service levels, commissions, and channel competition. Our analysis reveals that over-high service sharing reduces demand and profit; platforms must offer differentiated services to successfully induce exclusivity; competition can create a prisoner's dilemma. Also, under conditions of low commissions, intense competition, and a rival's superior services, a platform should refrain from service sharing even when it has the option to enforce exclusivity. Managerial implications: Our theoretical findings deliver key management insights for platforms. Service homogenization-exemplified by JD.com and Tmall's converging logistics and after-sales-drives manufacturers to adopt multiple platform strategies, escalating conflicts and prompting costly \"choose one out of two\" tactics. Instead, platforms should prioritize service uniqueness over mere parity to secure exclusive manufacturer partnerships, eschewing mindless mimicry of rivals. They must also assess market conditions to avoid over-provisioning services and falling into a prisoner's dilemma. Importantly, \" choose one out of two \" is not universally beneficial; in certain scenarios, platforms should forgo service sharing and let manufacturers operate on rivals' platforms as well."}}

We develop a neuroeconomic model that reveals how reference profits emerge from unconscious processes and construct preference models for conscious and subconscious decision-making in retailerled channels. This paper aims to: (1) uncover the generative mechanism of reference profit as an emergent outcome of unconscious awareness; and (2) explore the interplay between conscious and subconscious preferences for loss aversion (the asymmetric weighting of losses over gains) and fairness (redefined as symmetric profit/loss sharing) in retailer-led channels and their impact on channel coordination. The results show that reference profit evolution is anchored by actual profit and modulated by environmental feedback. Suppliers' guilt due to their preferences benefits channel coordination. Notably, a unit profit contract performs best when suppliers' subconscious appreciation of gains reinforces their conscious fairness preferences. This research refines the concept of fairness, explores its interplay with loss aversion at the conscious and subconscious level, and examines the impact on supply chain management. These insights deepen our understanding of how preference structures and reference points operate across different awareness levels, illuminating the multi-layered behavioral dynamics of channel members. Such understanding enables businesses to develop more effective coordination strategies and negotiation tactics."}}

Inevitably, the winner in the process of \"progress\" claims moral higher ground under the garb of rights given to him by God (and blessed by the Pope), for example, with the treaties of Tordesillas (1494) and Saragossa (1529) [1]. These treaties gave unlimited access to new lands and rights to their land, resources, and riches. Then came a wave of colonization from the other European powers, namely, the French, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and English. They claimed the world as their own, stamping their sovereignty in the name of God and the King. The worst example of displacement would be in the Americas, with civilizations being destroyed in the name of \"progress\"-Incas, Aztecs, among many others. Colonialism manifests in various forms, including settler colonialism, colonialism, and civilizing colonialism [2]. As we moved forward in time, the façade of God and King became a not-so-viable option for the continued exploitation of land. And then came the theories of economics, which aimed to justify the undue exploitation of land and resources, as well as the forced displacement of people. As we go forward in time, the displacement is justified by fair compensation of sorts. The story is no different in India, where multiple \"tools\" have been used to continually change the demography of aboriginal people in India and a systemic destruction of their native religion, customs, and livelihood in the name of \"progress\".

However, their real-world impact is shaped by how drivers adapt their behaviour over time. This study explores the behavioural adaptations associated with ADAS use through qualitative analysis of interviews with sixty drivers in Australia. As a result, we identify four interrelated themes: degradation of driving skills, shifting risk perception and tolerance, reduced cognitive and physical engagement, and diverse responses to system warnings. While ADAS can support safer driving, the findings reveal that over-reliance and complacency are common, potentially undermining the intended safety benefits. We argue that these behavioural adaptations form a dynamic process shaped by trust, perceived system capabilities, and user habits. To address this, integrated strategies that combine adaptive interface design, regulatory oversight, driver training, and real-time monitoring are needed to sustain safety and user competence. This study contributes novel insights into the long-term behavioural consequences of ADAS adoption in everyday contexts."}}

The jurisprudence of AI-driven disruption is examined in this study with an emphasis on how it affects copyright, corporate innovation, and the direction of cyber-regulation. AI has improved efficiency while upending conventional ideas of authorship and ownership in copyright law by automating legal duties including contract generation, document inspection, and legal analytics. AI's ability to produce and modify artistic creations poses new queries about what it means to \"create\" in the digital world, calling for a reinterpretation of long-standing legal doctrines. Furthermore, AI's role in supporting corporate innovation in industries such as content development, commerce, and cross-border transactions highlights its transformational potential, but it also raises ethical questions about bias, decision-making responsibility, and data privacy.&nbsp;This article examines how AI connects with existing legal and ethical frameworks, using ideas from legal theory, case studies, and technology breakthroughs such as IBM Watson. It proposes a dynamic regulatory strategy that goes beyond data privacy to include algorithm responsibility and digital rights management. By addressing these complications, this study presents a forward-thinking jurisprudence to ensure AI upholds the principles of equity and justice in an ever-changing digital context."}}

This study identified the impact of various hotel attributes on the room rate. Research methodology: Published data on available hotel attributes, and room rates of selected room categories of stargraded hotels in Colombo district, Sri Lanka, were gathered online through booking.com. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method was used to estimate the impact of key determinants under hotel amenities, quality signals, and locational attributes. Results: The results revealed eleven key attributes of the room rate in star-graded hotels, illustrating the positive impact from seven determinants and the negative impact from four determinants. Hotel class or star grade was the most significant determinant in the room rate, which generally determines the pricing behavior and service quality and most of the attributes and characteristics in a hotel. Availability of a business center, location of the hotel, fitness center/spa, total number of rooms in the hotel, room size, and view from room also significantly determined the room rate. Limitations: Booking.com, as the most popular Online Travel Agent (OTA) used in Sri Lanka, it was assumed that the information is frequently updated. The study was extended for the hotels in the Colombo district, and hence, the results were based on the point data, which may not be an islandwide representation or year through data. Contribution: As theoretical applications are underused in pricing and revenue decisions in the Sri Lankan hotel sector, results will lead to advance the decision making of practitioners, and this study will be a complement to the lack of literature in the field of revenue management in Sri Lankan context and may encourage future researchers laying an inspiring beginning."}}

This study seeks to address the empirical void surrounding revenue management strategies and their impact on revenue optimization. Specifically, it aims to delineate the challenges, opportunities, and effective methodologies for refining revenue management in casual dining establishments. Employing a quantitative research design, the study utilizes questionnaires as the primary data collection tool. The sample comprises casual dining restaurants with a seating capacity of twenty or more, (because smaller restaurants typically do not practice RM practices regularly) with a sample size of 191 determined using the Krejcie and Morgan Table. Hence data were collected from the above-mentioned restaurants category from Badulla district especially Ella, Bandarawela, Badulla, Mahiyanagana, Haputhale, Beragala &amp; Welimada areas. The data were analyzed using SPSS software to assess the influence of various revenue management strategies on revenue optimization, while also identifying the most salient strategies. Additionally, Smart-PLS software was leveraged to explore the critical factors that affect revenue optimization, offering profound insights into the interplay between strategic initiatives and financial outcomes. The findings underscore the paramount importance of a data-driven approach to revenue optimization within the casual dining sector. Both the analytical results and corroborating prior research highlight the significant role of both pricing and non-pricing strategies in optimizing revenue, with pricing strategies demonstrating a more substantial impact than non-pricing tactics such as overbooking and capacity management. These results not only enrich the academic discourse on revenue management but also provide actionable insights for restaurant managers, enabling them to leverage these strategies to maximize revenue generation more effectively."}}

The T-test is applied to determine the mean difference between the variables of a group variable and the test variable. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is used to determine the mean-variance among categorical groups, and it is discovered that gender, education qualification, home country, course duration, and English language fluency all have highly significant effects on cross-cultural adjustments, whereas staying in the host country has no effect. The mean scores of all factors in cross-cultural adjustments prove that approachability towards faculty is difficult and that individual shopping and working conditions are good.

The broad implementation of AI-based models faces obstacles because deep learning systems create complex internal operations that make external stakeholders unable to validate and trust their forecasts. The research analyzes how Explainable AI (XAI) plays an essential role in resolving these problems by studying its effects mainly in supply chain forecasting applications. Using XAI interpretability techniques SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) with attention mechanisms provides visible reasons about the complex model prediction process thus improving transparency. The trust established by explainable AI between supply chain managers and policymakers as well as business leaders enables them to make confident and responsible decisions. This study uses a literature review coupled with case examples and practical implementation to prove that XAI both connects precise models with interpretability potential and develops strong ethics and accountability for supply chain operations.

One emerging application is that of the digital twin within the firm's own operations as well as the broader supply chain.

The original idea of a digital twin is to represent in digital form an object, a product, an asset, a process, a network, or any combination of these, for superior prognostics and efficient resource utilization in the management and control of complex systems that are usually separated by distance (Grieves &amp; Vickers, 2017).

It highlights the central role of leadership gurus such as Simon Sinek, Brené Brown, and Gary Vaynerchuk, and critiques the risks of oversimplification and performative authenticity in algorithmically mediated leadership discourse. Using recent empirical findings and real-world examples, the analysis shows how emotionally resonant and morally charged content gains disproportionate visibility, potentially distorting leadership development and practice. This essay concludes by discussing implications for organizations, leadership education, and research, and calls for a renewed commitment to evidence-based leadership theory and practice in the face of algorithmic influence."}}

This paper discusses the essence of international arbitration, its development in international law, and the key principles according to which it functions. The main features are institutionalized, but flexible procedural bases in various forms, including institutional and ad hoc arbitration, and dedicated lines, including investor-state and commercial arbitration. The benefits are many, especially autonomy of the parties, which enables great control over the procedure, such as the choice of expert arbitrators. Confidentiality secures sensitive data, which is an exclusive attraction to businesses. More importantly, the universality of arbitral awards through the enforcement of the awards, mainly through the New York Convention, is an effective instrument of international justice. Effective international arbitration is based on the strong arbitral institutions (e.g., ICC, LCIA) and the existence of an arbitration agreement as well as the guaranteed enforceability of awards. After all, international arbitration is a strong balance of efficiency, fairness, and flexibility, which generates confidence and predictability in international trade."}}

This study explores the emergence of Industry 6.0 as a prospective industrial paradigm, characterized by intelligent, autonomous, and sustainable systems, which builds upon the digital foundations of its predecessors. Using management fashion theory as a theoretical lens, we analyze how these industrial concepts arise, diffuse, and potentially become institutionalized within management discourse. The study reveals that the adoption and dissemination of these paradigms are influenced not only by technological advancements but also by the discursive efforts of a fashion-setting community comprising academics, policymakers, consultants, and media actors. Industry 6.0, while still largely speculative, continues a broader trend of using numbered industrial revolutions to frame ongoing innovation. The findings suggest that such paradigms serve both practical and rhetorical purposes, driving organizational change while also reflecting shifting societal and managerial values. The study concludes with reflections on the implications for managers and policymakers as they navigate the evolving industrial landscape."}}

We conduct studies with experts (N = 128) and U.S. citizens (N = 2, 008) to provide these inputs. We find that 87% of experts judge that the social benefits from increasing R&amp;D spending at the margin exceed the costs, and 83% of experts and 81% of citizens support increasing R&amp;D spending. These results imply that increases in U.S. federal government R&amp;D spending are both valuable and politically feasible.

Industry 4.0 is the digital transformation of manufacturing, powered by technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and 3D printing. Nike has adopted several of these technologies to gain a competitive edge. For example, it uses AI to predict customer demand and personalize shopping experiences. Through augmented reality (AR), customers can get better shoe fittings, while 3D printing helps Nike produce customized shoes faster and with less waste. Its digital twin platform, Nikeland, allows Nike to test products virtually before physical launch. In manufacturing and supply chain, Nike uses robotics and data analytics to speed up production and improve efficiency. These efforts have also led to strong financial results, with Nike's digital sales making up a growing part of its revenue. On the sustainability side, Nike uses I4.0 to reduce material waste and energy use. Technologies like Flyknit and Flyleather help cut down on resources, while programs like \"Move to Zero\" aim to lower carbon emissions and support recycling. Despite the benefits, Nike faces challenges such as high automation costs, difficulty working with soft materials, and concerns over data privacy. To stay ahead, Nike needs to invest in new robotics, improve data protection, and better align product design with its manufacturing capabilities. In summary, Nike's smart use of Industry 4.0 technologies has helped it become more efficient, innovative, and sustainable, but continued focus on overcoming current challenges will be key to its future success."}}

We find that non-rate announcements are a significant source of domestic monetary policy surprises and international spillovers. Across event types, Fed communications are particularly influential for long-term interest rates and stock futures while BoC communications matter more to short-term interest rates. Since BoC communications have little effect on U.S. interest rates, Canadian announcements have a greater impact on the CAD/USD exchange rate by inducing larger changes in the crosscountry interest rate differential."}}

While digital platforms are often seen as democratizing economic opportunity, whether-and how-they affect the performance of disadvantaged producers remains underexplored. This study examines how music streaming platforms shape gender disparities by analyzing one of Spotify's most influential editorial playlists. Using data on over 67,000 songs featured across 45 countries from 2019 to 2022, we find that playlist rankings tend to favor female artists. However, although higher-ranking positions improve streaming outcomes, the benefits are, on average, greater for male artists. Further analysis shows that the performance penalties faced by female artists exceed the gains from favorable playlist placement on average, therefore playlist promotion narrows-but does not close-the gender performance gap. To probe the underlying mechanism, we conduct a split-sample analysis based on whether playlists show favorable or unfavorable placement of female artists. In both types of playlists, female artists receive significantly smaller streaming returns than their male counterparts. These results suggest that consumers do not systematically discount equity-driven promotion. Rather, entrenched biases-rooted in preferences or beliefsappear to constrain the effectiveness of editorial strategies aimed at closing gender gaps in streaming performance."}}

Though it appears to have gained traction recently, this is actually the older, simpler kind of word-of-mouth marketing that has been around for a while. Another possibility is that the influencer marketing strategy is a more developed form of the reference marketing plan. In this study, the researcher looked at how Indian consumers' purchasing decisions about organic cosmetics products are influenced by social media influencers. The aim of the research is, \"To investigate the role and influence of 'social media influencers' on the purchasing behaviour of Indian customers in the realm of organic cosmetic products\". The purpose is to identify the impact of 'social media influencers' on buying behaviour of domestic customer towards organic products. Three different factors that are determined from the survey have been used to evaluate the purchasing behaviour. In order to get participant opinions, the study employs an exploratory research methodology and a survey method using a structured questionnaire. The convenience sampling approach, which is non-probability, is used to choose the participants. 200 replies were gathered from various regions in Uttar Pradesh.

However, during the last few years, Industry 5.0 has emerged as an alternative visionary management concept. Although Industry 5.0 builds on and is related to its predecessor, it provides a different vision of the future of industry. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to carry out an in-depth examination of these two related management concepts, using management fashion theory as an interpretive framework and lens. Viewing Industry 4.0 and 5.0 from this vantage point involves analyzing and tracing the involvement activities of the suppliers of the two concepts as well as gauging the concepts' demand-side impact. Generally, the comparative analysis of the cases of Industry 4.0 and 5.0 indicates that, while the growth and popularity of Industry 4.0 appear to have plateaued, it remains at a high level. Although Industry 5.0 is growing in popularity and is gaining followers and supporters, it is still a much more marginal concept and movement. This study contributes to the management fashion literature by showing how two highly related but competing management concept movements coevolve. Furthermore, the two cases provide novel insights into the trajectories and lifecycles of fashionable management concepts, in particular, the early phase where actors are actively attempting to generate credibility and legitimacy and drum up support and enthusiasm for their preferred ideas."}}

Combining global multi-regional input-output tables, high-resolution water availability data, and subnational gross value added (GVA) for Europe's NUTS-3 regions, I find that supply chain spillover effects substantially amplify the macroeconomic losses caused by local water scarcity shocks. The negative effects are persistent and regions that are already drier today are the most vulnerable to supply chain transmitted water scarcity shocks. A counterfactual analysis reveals that over the period 2000-2019, the total cumulative European gross value added losses attributable to these shocks amounts to €12.3 trillion. This is more than three times the €3.7 trillion in estimated GVA losses when supply chain spillover effects are not accounted for. This paper highlights both the importance of integrating supply chain spillovers into climate impact assessments and the need for adaptation measures to enhance the supply chain resilience under future warming."}}

Within this framework, we use a new Monte Carlo based method to determine the optimal exercise time and the value of the real option representing the worth of an investment project. Model ambiguity arises due to uncertain parameter values in the model, and its severity is captured via confidence intervals of parameter estimates. This is the situation in most real-world projects; however, in academic work, it seems largely ignored. The classical Monte Carlo approach of Longstaff and Schwartz is unable to deal with such a setup. Our proposed approach, therefore, provides a significant extension of the computational toolbox for real options. Our approach is based on the insight that the value of a real option has an interpretation as the solution of a reflected backward stochastic differential equation (RBSDE), and that the part of the dynamic optimization process which depends on model ambiguity translates to a point-wise optimization of the driver function of the related RBSDE. This insight is then combined with a computational methodology for solving RBSDEs known as the Stratified Regression One-step Forward Dynamic Programming algorithm. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we consider a standard model of aquaculture investment and quantify the ambiguity premium due to parameter uncertainty. Our numerical results demonstrate that the ambiguity premium is substantial and that an increase in uncertainty leads to an earlier optimal harvesting time."}}

Using a \"shift-share\" instrumental variable approach, we show that migration inflows increase the labor share of local firms in China. To test the mechanisms predicted by the model, we show that migration inflows reduce capital per worker and raise the relative wages of skilled labor, while lowering the skill composition of firm employment. Finally, heterogeneity analysis shows that the effect is more pronounced among private firms and among migrants with relatively high levels of education, with no significant differences by gender."}}

Common ADR methods include mediation, arbitration, conciliation, and negotiation. ADR is widely acknowledged as a cost-effective, time-efficient, and less adversarial alternative to conventional litigation. It puts a full stop to the disputes effectively rather to protracted litigation in the courts and tribunals. Across the globe, ADR has been embraced to reduce the burden on courts and to provide more accessible justice at the very ease and convenience of parties to dispute. In Pakistan, the formal legal system has become increasingly burdened with a growing backlog of civil and corporate cases, often resulting in delays of several years. This inefficiency underscores the urgent need to adopt ADR as an effective mechanism for dispute resolution. Pakistan's legal framework provides for ADR in statutes such as the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (as amended), the Arbitration Act, 1940, and the Recognition and Enforcement (Arbitration Agreements and Foreign Arbitral Awards) Act, 2011. This article explores the importance and need for ADR in Pakistan, examines its implementation in civil and corporate litigation, and references both international and Pakistani laws to highlight its efficacy."}}

To help address the issue of enterprise informality, the government enacted the Barangay Micro-business Enterprises (BMBEs) Act of 2002, with the aim of formalizing microenterprises through the provision of incentives. Using data from a national-level census of BMBEs and business counselors directly involved in the implementation of the law, this study sought to evaluate the BMBE Law vis-à-vis its goal of reducing informality. In doing so, it focused on evaluating business registration, incentives and benefits received by the BMBEs, impact on microenterprises' formalization rate, and impact on BMBEs' business operations and development. Results from the descriptive statistics reveal that the law has been largely ineffective in addressing informality and fostering microenterprise development. In this light, this study recommends policy amendments to account for the recent enactment of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, administrative burdens, and conflicting regulatory priorities. However, given the lengthy legislative amendment process, a more immediate approach would be for implementing agencies to update the implementing rules and regulations and conduct awareness campaigns to enhance the policy's reach and impact."}}

Based on a positivist paradigmatic approach, a quantitative research approach surveyed 503 respondents from four selected mining communities (Tarkwa, Obuasi, Prestea, and Bogoso). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), particularly AMOS 24 software, was employed to analyse the collected data. The study finds that among the four sustainability practices implemented by the mining companies, ethical sustainability was the only practice that directly influenced the community&apos;s well-being. The study&apos;s findings indicate that the mining companies&apos; sustainability practices alone cannot yield the expected results of improving community well-being.

Motivated by the rapid adoption of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) contracts---an interest-free, short-term consumer borrowing product---we examine how consumer liquidity affects a retailer's pricing and inventory management decisions. We analyze these decisions in a setting that involves three parties: a retailer, consumers, and a FinTech firm. The goal of the retailer is to jointly set the inventory level and price of a product to maximize its expected profit. The retailer's customers are both price sensitive and cash constrained. We capture this latter new feature by extending classic demand models and explicitly modeling both consumers' willingness to pay and ability to pay. For customers who are willing to pay the product's full price but are not able to do so in one payment, the FinTech firm offers BNPL contracts. The FinTech firm pays the retailer an endogenized discounted price, determined by its cost of capital and customers' risk of default, in exchange for collecting the product's full price from customers over multiple installments. We show that this setting admits a unique Nash equilibrium and characterize the long-term impacts of BNPL contracts on the retailer's profit, product's price, product's availability, and consumer surplus. A key insight provided by our analysis is that although BNPL contracts alleviate the effects of liquidity friction, they limit the retailer's ability to allocate its inventory among its customers efficiently. This can reduce both the retailer's profit and consumer surplus, indicating that BNPL services may not be appropriate for all products and markets.\n</div>"}}

Unlike traditional models that treat these elements separately, the proposed approach integrates strategic, tactical, and operational decisions into a unified framework. At the upper level, the model allocates warehouse space among three shelving technologies based on setup costs and space efficiency, aiming to minimize construction costs. At the lower level, it optimizes item-to-location assignment and order picking under probabilistic demand across multiple periods. The model accounts for equipment constraints, inventory balance, and routing efficiency. A feedback mechanism updates shelf capacity estimates iteratively between the two levels. To solve this complex structure, an enumerative heuristic method is used, combining discrete leader-level search with GAMS-based follower optimization. The model’s key innovations include: (1) full integration of all warehouse planning layers, (2) incorporation of uncertainty in demand, and (3) a practical, computationally feasible solution method. Numerical results demonstrate significant cost savings and improved space utilization compared to conventional methods. This model offers a robust decision-support tool for warehouse designers operating under uncertain and dynamic conditions."}}

As the world strives to decarbonise and to relinquish energy sources that produce harmful emissions, the demand for lithium is rising to astronomical levels. Zimbabwe's lithium is a prime target for the producers of lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars, smartphones, laptops, and solar panels for domestic use. However, Zimbabwe's law and mining policy need to include measures to ensure that citizens properly participate in and profit from its extractive activities, including the mining of lithium. Outdated mining legislation and past experience show that the exploitation of a resource can be a curse in Zimbabwe, as in the smuggling of diamonds and the sequestration of the wealth generated by gold mining to only a few individuals. Public participation in decision-making in the lithium industry is a scarce commodity, and it is generally expected that a repeat of the catastrophic circumstances of Zimbabwean gold and diamond mining is likely to be seen in the lithium industry. This article examines the social implications of the lack of effective regulation of Zimbabwe's lithium industry. It assesses Zimbabwe's current decision to ban raw lithium exports and answers the question whether this has positive social implications for communities that live near lithium deposits."}}

Leveraging a novel dataset containing employment histories and voter turnout records for 28 million Americans, along with a quasi-experimental mover design, we find strong causal evidence that peer civic engagement increases individual turnout. In contrast, we find limited evidence for top-down effects from managers. The influence of organizational civic culture is especially pronounced in low-turnout elections, among college graduates, younger employees, and those without an established track record of voting, and when a greater proportion of coworkers share the employee's partisan affiliation. These findings identify employer organizations as a previously overlooked but important scaffold to democratic institutions."}}

The relevance of the study is due to the growing demands of the international market for safety, transparency and traceability of plant products, which makes it impossible for Ukrainian exporters of medicinal raw materials to compete effectively without internationally recognized organic certification. At the same time, the sector still faces the problems of regulatory non-compliance, high costs and limited availability of certification procedures, which hinder the integration of Ukrainian producers into premium sales channels. The aim of the article. The article is aimed at substantiating the impact of organic certification on the formation of competitiveness of enterprises exporting medicinal plants, taking into account economic, institutional and technological factors in the context of the current global situation. Research methodology. The methodological basis is the content analysis of international standards (EU Organic, USDA NOP, Bio Suisse, Naturland), statistical analysis of export dynamics in 2006-2023, comparative analysis of price indicators of certified and non-certified products, as well as generalization of applied cases of Ukrainian exporters and data from official reports of TRACES, Organic Standard, FiBL. Research results. It was found that the certificate increases the selling price of products by 15-25%, reduces the share of cargo returns to 0.5%, and provides access to new sales channels and tenders from leading European traders. A direct correlation between the certification status of the manufacturer and the stability of export contracts is revealed. The importance of institutional support and digital infrastructure (TRACES, DUNS) for export scaling is substantiated. Scientific novelty. For the first time, the quantitative and qualitative effects of organic certification are summarized in the context of medicinal plant exports from Ukraine, barriers to access to organic markets are structured, and practical mechanisms for strengthening the market position of small and medium-sized producers through certification instruments are outlined. Conclusions. It is proved that certification is a key tool for strengthening the international competitiveness of Ukrainian exporters of medicinal plants. Successful implementation of certification strategies requires the involvement of state support, institutional support, development of cooperation and raising awareness of producers about the benefits of certified exports. Prospects for further research. An in-depth study of the mechanisms of clustering organic production, the long-term socioeconomic effects of involving households in certified medicinal crops, as well as an assessment of the possibilities of implementing digital solutions for traceability and certification monitoring seems advisable.</span>"}}

This study systematically reviews two primary branches of maintenance-reactive (corrective) and proactive (preventive and predictive) strategies-through a comprehensive analysis of academic literature. A structured collection of peer-reviewed papers was compiled from Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, using targeted keywords such as \"maintenance strategy,\" \"maintenance management,\" \"reliability,\" and specific approaches (\"Preventive Maintenance,\" \"Condition-Based Maintenance,\" \"Predictive Maintenance\"). Our findings reveal that reactive maintenance, while simple and low-cost, often results in unplanned downtime and higher long-term expenses. In contrast, proactive methods (e.g., scheduled maintenance, condition-based monitoring) significantly improve operational efficiency, reduce failures, and optimize lifecycle costs. The evidence suggests that proactive strategies are the superior choice for industries where reliability and costeffectiveness are critical."}}

A qualitative case study method was implemented to obtain information from 8 participants through semi-structured interview as the main method, followed by focus group discussion and solicited journal diaries of the participants. The analyses of data derived from the first research question yielded five major themes: lack of exposure to L2 oral communication, cultural values, low L2 self-confidence, L2 extrinsic motivation, and enabling behaviors. Analysis of the second research question revealed six major themes as: raised awareness, cultural background, personality, exposure to L2 oral communication, extrinsic L2 motivation, and increased L2 selfconfidence. The findings of the study concluded that rare exposure to English oral communication in Iran resulted in having little practice of English language in authentic settings that led to low L2 WTC among the respondents of the study before coming to Malaysia. Besides, the respondents suffered from lack of L2 WTC upon arrival to Malaysia. However, by understanding their deficiencies and importance of L2 oral communication, they gradually changed their attitude toward L2 oral communication and tried to improve it. This study also provides theoretical and practical implications for designing teaching methods to maximize language learners' L2 WTC in the classroom that leads to their L2 oral communication improvement."}}

Anchored in Modigliani &amp; Miller's dividend irrelevance proposition, the paper contrasts theoretical neutrality with real-world phenomena where bonus issues serve as potent signals of managerial confidence, tools for liquidity enhancement, and mechanisms for optimizing perceived capital structure. Using extensive data on nearly 30 prominent Indian firmsincluding Infosys, TCS, Reliance, Wipro-and 10 global benchmarks like Apple, Tesla, Amazon, and Alibaba over 2008-2024, the analysis reveals that bonus shares often fulfill multiple overlapping objectives: conserving cash while rewarding investors, maintaining optimal trading ranges to boost liquidity, creating psychological wealth effects, and strategically aligning with regulatory or tax considerations. The report also details how India's regulatory regime under the Companies Act and SEBI ICDR tightly governs bonus issuance, contrasting with more liberal frameworks in the US and UK. Empirical case studies show positive short-term price reactions and liquidity shifts, underscoring that bonus issues are rarely purely cosmetic. This research provides nuanced insights for corporate managers, investors, and policymakers, suggesting that while bonus issues do not inherently alter firm value, they shape market perceptions, shareholder sentiment, and can strategically position firms in capital markets."}}

With the broad FTC ban on hold for the foreseeable future, the spotlight shifts back to the states where innovation in noncompete policy is blossoming. In this study, we systematically explore the legislative and policy trends reshaping the U.S. noncompete landscape. We propose a novel typology of these reforms and apply a theory of policy diffusion to explain the rapid spread of ideas across disparate jurisdictions, regulatory agencies, and in the consciousness of workers and policy makers. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a notable surge in state-level legislative activity since 2015, with 93 percent of reforms occurring in the last decade, including some states with multiple rounds of reform. Strikingly, 40 percent of these changes were enacted on a bi-partisan basis. We provide the first evidence of noncompetes as an example of policy diffusion and argue that, despite the stalled FTC ban, these legislative changes are a potential harbinger of future legal reforms related to employee fairness and human capital-focused competition.</p>"}}

We use a Hotelling model with vertical differentiation and a captive market (hinterland). Unlike standard Bertrand or vertical differentiation models, which predict unambiguous consumer benefits, our model reveals a richer set of welfare outcomes. Consumer surplus and total welfare may increase or decrease post-merger. This depends on allocative efficiency (how consumers are distributed between firms) and output efficiency (total output achieved). We show that mergers can increase consumer surplus while reducing total welfare. This depends on the interaction between intrinsic value effects, transportation cost effects, and the size of the hinterland. The type of differentiation – whether vertical or in transportation costs – is critical, as it influences the balance between the elimination of double marginalisation and raising rivals’ costs. These findings underline the need to account for market-specific factors when assessing the welfare implications of mergers between complement producers.</span>"}}

While internal and socioeconomic factors such as store layout or local competition are well-studied in brick-and-mortar retail, the specific impact of store attributes on food waste remains largely unexplored. Our research explores the relationship between store-specific attributes and in-store food waste using proprietary transaction data and socioeconomic data from a European grocery chain. The dataset covers 315 stores across both urban and non-urban areas. Using the Double Machine Learning algorithm XGBoost for causal inference, we find that store attributes significantly affect food waste levels. Specifically, merchant-owned stores generate less waste, possibly due to different incentive structures. In contrast, inventory systems that rely on double placement and backroom storage are associated with higher waste.&nbsp; \n<div>\n Our findings show that store operations and organizational approaches significantly influence food waste. In particular, store organization and ownership form, inventory systems with double placement, and backroom usage are linked to higher waste levels. Through counterfactual analysis, we estimate that food waste could be reduced by up to 5.2%. This study offers empirical evidence concerning key store attributes that drive food waste, highlighting opportunities for reduction and helping store managers enhance sustainability in retail operations.\n</div>"}}

In this rejection of imperialism, particularly given its positioning in a unique historical circumstance, broadcasts that reached every corner of the region made of this enemy an object. This paper considers the context at play to argue for the occidental bent of the radio station through the prisms of agency, subjectivity and alterity and underpinned by Kantian theories. The three areas would motivate the actions that were taken. The emerging power of Nasserism as a potent socialist ideology, linguistic choices within programming and visual elements that extended beyond the audio medium uniting peoples across borders all had bearing on furthering this impression of what was a key political instrument in the modern history of the Arab world."}}

Based on the case of impact sourcing—hiring and training of disadvantaged staff for global business services—we seek to better understand this interplay. In general, we find that social enterprises in this context either focus on serving domestic clients with an implicit social mission and an integrated social enterprise model or international clients with a more explicit social mission and a decoupled model. We discuss why both main configurations represent viable social enterprise models in the outsourcing industry and why, in particular, the professional background of founders plays a key role in these strategic choices. Our findings contribute to a more nuanced and context-sensitive understanding of social enterprise model adoption in emerging economies.</p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>"}}

The goal is to understand how HRM strategies contribute to organizational effectiveness, ethics, and adaptability in complex, highrisk contexts. Design/Method/Approach: Using a qualitative research design, the study employed a systematic literature review and case study analysis of ten leading humanitarian organizations operating globally between January 2019 and March 2025. Data were thematically analyzed to identify strategic HR trends and challenges. The study followed a two-stage qualitative research approach. First, a systematic literature review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines to ensure transparency in source selection and analysis. Findings: The analysis revealed five major themes shaping IHRM practices: (1) localization and national staff empowerment, (2) safeguarding and duty of care, (3) remote management and digital HR innovations, (4) staff wellbeing and resilience strategies, and (5) leadership development. While organizations are advancing ethical leadership, technology use, and local capacity building, systemic inequalities, digital divides, and resource constraints persist. Theoretical Implications: The study contributes to the development of IHRM in nonprofit and crisis-response settings by integrating ethical leadership, resilience, and localization into HRM theory. It highlights the need to adapt strategic HRM frameworks to volatile and resourcelimited environments. Practical Implications: Humanitarian HR practitioners can apply these insights to improve local workforce development, strengthen safeguarding protocols, and implement context-appropriate digital HR solutions. The findings offer actionable strategies for enhancing organizational agility and ethical governance. Originality/Value: This research addresses a significant gap in literature by examining IHRM through the lens of humanitarian action-a context often overlooked in mainstream HRM theory. It reframes HRM as a central, strategic function in crisis-affected operations. Research Limitations/Future Research: The study is limited by its reliance on secondary data and selected case studies. Future research could incorporate primary data from field HR personnel or extend the analysis to regional NGOs. Comparative studies across sectors or conflict regions are also recommended."}}

To isolate informational effects from confounding factors, we use peer-related variation around quasi-random rating thresholds, complemented by information shocks from peer workplace awards.

This study explores the digital transformation of tourism in Bangladesh, identifying significant links between technology acceptance, social media usage and travel experiences. Results show a strong connection between the use of travel technology and reliance on social media for decisions, with comfort in technology correlating with satisfaction in personalised travel platforms. Social media facilitates trip planning and booking, with tourists showing increased trust in online tools. The study underscores the transformative potential of digital technology in reshaping the travel landscape, urging industry players to innovate to meet evolving consumer expectations through quantitative analysis by using structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the relationships among the variables.

Each user receives private exogenous information about B-positive or negative-after which they self-select into the desired plan. When can the platform utilise information about user-level social networks and optimally allocate personalised incentives to users to maximise profit? In equilibrium, influential users receive greater incentives, which attract other susceptible users to join E.

A strong positive correlation between weekly developer counts and code commits (r = 0.954) highlights the close link between community size and technical productivity. Developer engagement rose steadily from 2015 to 2022, before declining through early 2025. This drop is interpreted as a sign of ecosystem consolidation and maturity, rather than reduced relevance.

Authorship becomes an act of participation rather than mere origination, and epistemic vitality is measured by presence, reflection, and adaptive engagement.

The findings reveal significant correlations between exposure to populist rhetoric and heightened negative emotions, such as fear and anger, toward ethnoreligious and political minorities (r = 0.56). While political affiliation demonstrates a weaker direct influence (r = 0.14), perceptions of migration as culturally and economically beneficial are strongly associated with higher social cohesion (r = 0.69). Minority groups report elevated levels of exclusion and fear, yet national pride correlates with inclusive attitudes in some cases (r =-0.64, with prejudicial views). Civil society organizations play a critical role in mitigating divisive effects by fostering inclusivity and dialogue. These insights inform strategies to counteract the polarizing impacts of civilizational populism, emphasizing the importance of inclusive narratives and policy interventions to enhance social cohesion in diverse societies. The study's limitations include reliance on secondary data and challenges in establishing causality, highlighting the need for further research using more direct measures of populism and contemporary datasets. Despite these constraints, the findings contribute empirical evidence to the growing literature on the social and emotional consequences of populism, offering a foundation for policies aimed at promoting harmony and reducing polarization in the UK."}}

These span methodological orientation, purpose, process phases, participation, epistemology, output logic, system scope, validation criteria, and paradigmatic stance. The resulting taxonomy not only addresses a persistent methodological lacuna in the field but also reflects the pluralistic, reflexive, and increasingly participatory transformation of contemporary foresight practice. It provides a versatile tool for both theoretical inquiry and practical design, enabling practitioners and scholars to select and tailor foresight methods in accordance with context-specific epistemic commitments, strategic goals, and stakeholder configurations. By articulating the multidimensional architecture of anticipatory knowledge production, the study advances the theoretical foundations of foresight and enhances its utility for anticipatory governance in a world marked by volatility, disruption, and contested futures."}}

I identify a novel series of shocks using a decomposition of high-frequency movements in asset prices around International Monetary Fund announcements concerning Argentina, which I characterize as sovereign liquidity shocks. Using this series, I estimate the dynamic causal effects of sovereign risk on key macroeconomic variables. A sovereign liquidity shock associated with a 100-basis-point increase in sovereign spreads decreases output by 0.96 percent in the months following the shock, with the contraction primarily driven by declines in investment. Evidence suggests that these effects operate through disruptions in international lending and trade, while domestic financial intermediation plays little to no role in propagating the shock."}}

Despite this understanding, the impact of the informal economy on inflation and output dynamics in these countries remains poorly understood. This study investigates the extent to which monetary policy can stabilize economies with a large informal market. First, we use VAR analysis to provide new evidence indicating that the labor informality rate increases in response to contractionary monetary policy. Second, we explore the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through a two-sector New Keynesian (NK) model that incorporates endogenous firm entry. This analysis allows us to examine the role of informality in sectoral reallocation, inflation, and output dynamics. Our findings suggest that, under a reasonable calibration of the model, the presence of a flexible, informal sector results in a lower sacrifice ratio in response to a tightening of monetary policy. This suggests that informality enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy."}}

The researchers developed an interview protocol that included the purpose of the study, a statement of confidentiality, and fifteen interview questions with three foci: company sustainability practices, sustainability performance assessment, and communication with stakeholders. In total, thirteen CEOs/founders of the U.S. based FSBs were interviewed. Interviews were conducted on ZOOM, a web meeting platform, with each interview lasting between 50-75 minutes. The interviews were recorded and later transcribed for data analysis.  From a pragmatic standpoint, our findings provide an extended typology of current fashion small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the U.S. and present these diverse, dynamic business powers operating at the grassroots level. This study also echoes the insights of previous studies, affirming that NSBV resources are not sequential and not every organization engages in clean technology development. Extending the findings from existing study, we provide insight into how clean technology resources serve as a critical distinguishing element between SME and Innovative Driven Enterprises (IDEs) types."}}

I analyze a field experiment involving 14,500 e-commerce retailers in Argentina and Brazil conducted during the two weeks before Black Friday, a major sales event. The intervention randomized messages reminding managers that Black Friday was approaching and encouraging them to plan their pricing and advertising strategies. Treated firms shifted from generic to discount-related advertising and increased inventories before the event, but did not vary their pricing relative to the control group. As a result, sales increased by 5.2% for 60 days following the intervention. Machine learning methods reveal larger returns for relatively bigger firms with a stronger social media presence, suggesting strategic complementarities between firm size and light-touch interventions. These findings highlight that psychological constraints may be a meaningful barrier to the performance of small firms."}}

We find that funds respond to comment letters by providing more discussions about risk and uncertainty and adopting a more negative tone. Funds pay higher audit fees, potentially due to auditors’ involvement in the process. Comment letters are initially associated with negative abnormal fund flows that are reversed in the following quarter. After comment letters, fund flows respond less positively to fund performance and less negatively to expenses and risk disclosures, consistent with investors perceiving less agency frictions in fund reporting. Lastly, receiving comment letters reduces the likelihood of future SEC enforcement actions when they are initiated through administrative proceedings, and when comment letters address the same issue as a potential enforcement action. Overall, our findings suggest that SEC comment letters help improve mutual fund disclosures and influence investors’ perceptions of the quality of such disclosures.&nbsp;"}}

We propose a state-dependent policy that integrates real-time pricing with adaptive relocation and prove that it achieves a per-edge revenue loss of O(n^-2/3 |G| log n), where G denotes the set of customer trip edges in the network, relative to a fluid model benchmark. Our analysis reveals that this optimality gap is attainable with the additional safety staffing n 0 , whose magnitude depends on the network topology and relocation speeds. This quantifies the operational cost of travel-time stochasticity and demonstrates that pricing alone cannot ensure efficiency in large-scale stochastic networks. Our framework offers a tractable and provably effective approach for demand-supply coordination in modern service networks."}}

We examine the 2006 presidential impeachment in Brazil as an exogenous shock that suddenly reversed the policies benefiting politically connected firms, linking previous political ties to corruption and undue influence. Our robust evidence indicates that companies with politically connected directors experienced economic downturns during the transitional government, leading to significantly increased divestment activity.

Subsequently, the contribution sources of watershed runoff for these two stages were calculated based on the random forest model, and the water source conservation capacity of the watershed was calculated and evaluated based on the optimal model parameters. The results show: 1) In both stages, the R2 of runoff simulation reached above 0.70, and the values of NSE and KGE were above 0.65, indicating good simulation effects in both the calibration and validation periods. On a monthly scale, the runoff volume during the flood season was higher than that in the non-flood season, with the maximum measured runoff values in July for 1963-1990 and in August for 1991-2022; 2) Surface runoff, baseflow, and subsurface flow contribute 34.15%, 42.07%, and 23.78% of the total runoff volume on an annual scale, respectively. Surface runoff and baseflow are the main sources of runoff replenishment during the ablation period and non-ablation period, respectively; 3) The annual average water source conservation capacity of the watershed is 66.256 mm, the average water source conservation rate is 15.846%; 4) Under four climate scenarios, both precipitation and runoff are increasing, with the largest increase in runoff under the SSP5-8.5 climate scenario. The future runoff simulation in this study can estimate the impact of climate change on water resources and help formulate adaptation and mitigation measures."}}

This paper critically examines the primary economic theories underpinning the AfCFTA's projected benefits, focusing on neoclassical trade theory concepts such as comparative advantage, economies of scale, and dynamic gains from trade. It elucidates how these theories are expected to foster efficient resource allocation, enhance productivity, and stimulate economic development across the continent. Furthermore, it addresses the nuanced discussion of whether the AfCFTA exhibits characteristics of mercantilism, arguing that its foundational principles are antithetical to mercantilist tenets, despite some superficial overlaps related to developmental regionalism and import substitution and industrialization strategies. In conclusion, the AfCFTA is primarily conceptualized as a trade liberalization instrument designed to foster a positive-sum game through enhanced market integration and accelerated industrialization. A robust understanding of the Agreement's underlying economic logic is crucial for policymakers and Development Partners in designing more effective implementation strategies and proactively addressing potential challenges. It is important to acknowledge, however, that a key limitation of this analysis, and indeed the AfCFTA itself, which stems from the complexity of implementing such a vast and transformative agreement, coupled with the inherently long-term nature of its projected economic transformations."}}

However, conventional recurrent neural network-based models, such as gated recurrent units (GRUs), often suffer from substantial performance degradation over extended forecasting horizons due to recursive error accumulation and limited spatial awareness. This study proposes an enhanced deep learning framework that systematically improves GRU-based forecasting through three progressive strategies: (1) autoregressive sequence-to-sequence learning to mitigate error accumulation (GRU-AR), (2) multi-point synchronous prediction to capture spatial dependencies (GRU-AR-M), and (3) hybrid integration of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks with GRU for spatiotemporal feature extraction (CNN-GRU-AR). The framework was evaluated on a campus-scale drainage system and validated with field data from a Swiss combined sewer network. Results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of all three enhancements. In the numerical case, CNN-GRU-AR increased the average Nash efficiency coefficient (NSE) from 0.74 to 0.94 and reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 59.1% compared to the standard GRU over a 60-minute forecasting horizon. In real-world validation, the model improved average NSE from 0.81 to 0.91 and reduced MAE by 21.5% over a 90-minute horizon. Notably, in the two cases, NSE at the 60- and 90-minute lead times improved from 0.48 to 0.89 and 0.45 to 0.81, respectively, confirming significantly enhanced long-term performance.

However, scaling CQF to larger deterministic networks introduces challenges such as increased link delays and synchronization inaccuracies, which reduce the effective time interval in each CQF time slot and lower usable bandwidth. To address this, Multi-CQF was introduced, utilizing three or more queues to absorb the effects of link delays and decouple transmission from reception timing, enhancing bandwidth utilization. However, this improvement incurs a trade-off: the queuing delay upper bound increases from T (one time slot) in traditional CQF to 2T in Multi-CQF (3-queue). This extended queuing delay subsequently elevates end-to-end delay, which can compromise the network’s ability to meet strict real-time requirements and degrade service quality.In this paper, we propose the Effective Phase Alignment (EPA) mechanism to reduce queuing delay in Multi-CQF by aligning the effective phase (phase difference between the sending and receiving windows). By optimizing this phase alignment, the upper bound of the average queuing delay of all flows can be reduced from 2T to 1.5T. In cases of perfect alignment, the queuing delay can be minimized to match the performance of traditional CQF. This approach significantly reduces queuing delay, making Multi-CQF better able to meet the stringent requirements of modern deterministic communication networks."}}

A cross-sectional observational study was conducted with 444 workers from Portuguese companies and institutions, contacted through convenience sampling. Data were collected from November 2023 to March 2025 through a questionnaire comprising validated scales: SFSSQ (Supervision Satisfaction), PSS-10 (Perceived Stress), JAWS (Job Well-being), and QCL (Leadership Competencies). Leadership competencies and satisfaction with supervision were significantly correlated with well-being (ρ = 0.514, p < 0.001 and ρ = 0.577, p < 0.001) and stress (ρ = -0.336, p < 0.001 and ρ = -0.336, p < 0.001). The Coordinator role was most strongly associated with well-being, while the Facilitator role was associated with lower stress. Statistically significant differences were identified across professional areas for all variables, except stress. The results suggest that all leadership competencies are valued, with a preference for organization, participation, innovation, and clear structure. Differences between areas highlight the need to study the more vulnerable areas, such as healthcare, and underscore the importance of aligning leadership styles with organizational culture. This study reinforces the importance of leadership in promoting well-being and reducing stress in the workplace, highlighting the need to invest in leadership training that aligns competencies with team needs and the specific contexts of each organization."}}

These modules exhibit complex characteristics, including irregular geometry, heterogeneous composition, off-center mass distributions, and sensitive internal precision instruments, rendering them vulnerable to improper handling. Existing loading strategies often disregard safety requirements and fail to accommodate stringent assembly sequence constraints. To address these issues, this study presents a multi-objective optimization method for MEP module transportation and loading. An accurate centroid calculation model is developed for irregular, heterogeneous modules with asymmetrical mass distributions. A mathematical model minimizes reshuffling effort and normalized centroid deviation, subject to comprehensive geometric and physical constraints. A dual-encoding strategy integrates loading sequence and orientation, supported by a novel 3D Bin Packing Algorithm incorporating Center-Line Priority Loading and Non-Geometric Centroid Alignment (3DBP-CLP-NGCAM). This algorithm is embedded in an enhanced Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). Experimental results indicate stable convergence within 200 generations, producing Pareto-optimal loading schemes. Relative to the initial results, f1 and f2 demonstrated overall decreases of 54.5% and 11.9%, respectively. Compared to traditional methods, the approach reduces reshuffling by 6.4% and centroid deviation by 30.4%.

To investigate this role, the study measured gender motivation, shame management, and apology motivation among 309 employees in a private company. The results revealed that shame acknowledgment mediates the relationship between gender motivations and apology motivation. The results also suggest that even when individuals who adhere to pressured feminine norms engage in shame avoidance behavior, their tendency to apologize increases due to motivations such as relationship value and fear of sanction. These findings highlight that shame avoidance does not always lead to reluctance to apologize and underline the importance of gender motivation in shaping apology behavior. Managers can facilitate positive changes in employees&apos; shame and apology strategies by fostering an organizational climate that promotes gender equality and a culture in which employees have equal access to rewards, resources, and opportunities."}}

We unlocked their potential by introducing necessary system-level complements into our social and economic systems. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is the rising GPT on the horizon, promising to reshape how we live and work. However, like its predecessors, AI's welfare-generating power is not promised without intention. If we want AI to enhance welfare rather than merely generate wealth, we must invest in the appropriate system-level complements to catalyze a shift toward our collective goals. This article is dedicated to identifying these complements and suggesting where complex systems science offers unique insights for their development. In the remainder of this article, we define GPTs as disruptive innovations that improve over time, spur advancements across multiple sectors, and fundamentally reshape industries, markets, and organizational practices. We further define system-level complements as the social institutions, cultural norms, capital investments, and human and scientific resources required to realize the welfare benefits of a GPT."}}

While traditional methods require extensive training and parameter tuning, foundational models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer a low-resource training alternative. In this paper, we propose One-Shot Anomaly Detection with Segment Anything Model (OSAD-SAM), a novel multimodal prompts framework that leverages the contextual flexibility of text prompts alongside the precision of image prompts to enhance anomaly classification and segmentation. OSAD-SAM first performs anomaly segmentation in parallel using text prompts (i.e., expert knowledge) and image prompts (i.e., prior knowledge), and then further enhances anomaly detection by fusing the anomaly segmentation results from these two modalities (i.e., text and image). In the text prompts module, it refers to the cascade of patch-level anomaly region localization and pixel level anomaly region refinement. In the image prompts module, it refers to the cascade of target-specific prompts extraction and anomaly refinement. To alleviate the ambiguity of multi-scale anomaly masks, we employed a fine-tuning approach that requires training only two weight parameters (i.e., lightweight training). The training process only takes a few seconds, yet it improves anomaly detection performance. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA datasets demonstrate that OSAD-SAM achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming existing methods in both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks."}}

Debt transcends numbers, becoming a pact of justice and duty. Globally, the IMF's grip, dollar's sway, and cryptocurrency's rebellion challenge nations to balance autonomy with enduring stability. Is debt a spark of progress or a theft from the future? Merging economic imperatives with meditations on responsibility and legacy, the study probes the fairness of borrowing-its toll on people, its tension with planetary limits, and its entanglement with political fervor. From Eurozone's austerity to global debt's rise, it seeks not solutions but insight, questioning how nations can borrow with integrity. With a poet's vision, this work follows the fragile arc of obligation, measuring the ethical cost of promises forged in pursuit of prosperity against the quiet demand for a future unbowed by yesterday's debts."}}

Drawing from symbolic, economic, and geopolitical insights, the paper examines the weakening of Israel's moral authority, U.S. strategic ambiguity, and Iran’s performative resistance. It highlights how far-right politics, arms industry lobbying, and algorithmic visibility are shaping war decisions.

This article aims to make up for this shortfall in Western awareness by providing important background information on China's state-owned enterprises in the shipbuilding industry and also why this particular shipyard (CMI Weihai) was able to provide the vessels required by BC Ferries at unbeatable prices, before concluding by providing lessons and suggestions for Canada's nascent shipbuilding industry based on China's successful experiences.&nbsp;"}}

The feed-forward aspect of DNN-based models makes it difficult to incorporate the long-span contextual influence into spoken utterances. Another typical strategy in HMM-based TTS for establishing a continuous speech trajectory is using the dynamic characteristics to constrain the production of speech parameters [2]. Parametric time-to-speech synthesis is used in this study by capturing the co-occurrence or correlation data between any two points in a spoken phrase using time aware memory network cells. Based on our experiments, a combination of DNN and BLSTM-RNN is the best sysstem to use. Upper hidden layers of this system use a bidirectional RNN structure of LSTM, the low layers use a simple, one way structure followed by additional layers. On objective and subjective metrics, it surpasses both the traditional decision-based tree HMM’s and the DNN-TTS system. Dynamic limitations are superfluous since the BLSTM-RNN TTS produces very smooth speech trajectories."}}

A total of 600 job postings were collected in six occupational domains (economics, computer science, accounting, teaching, customer service, and sales). For each posting, six nearly identical CVs were submitted, varying only by the candidate's gender and attached photo. In total, 3,600 CVs were evaluated by the AI system, which assigned them match scores ranging from 1 to 100. The findings reveal that the AI system does not evaluate candidates in a neutral manner, but rather is influenced by the intersection of gender, appearance, and job domain. A significant beauty premium was observed for women in all fields, whereas men benefited from such a premium only in female-dominated domains. In addition, plain candidates, especially women, faced a pronounced penalty when applying to jobs not stereotypically aligned with their gender. The effects did not vary by job type (roles involving public interaction vs. office-based positions) but were stronger in entry-level positions. The results suggest that AI-based screening systems may preserve and reinforce visual and gender-based stereotypes in recruitment processes."}}

To understand how to design airdrops in this adversarial setting, we analyze a market inhabited by real users and farmers, where the latter may costlessly create an arbitrary amount of fake accounts. We show that by correctly aligning incentives, a platform that cannot detect even a single fake account can still harness farmers to increase both its appeal to real users, and its revenue. While motivated by airdrops, our work applies to other reward schemes."}}

The model is based on sealed-bid auction frameworks, where buyers determine prices according to their energy demand and risk aversion, and generators decide on the amount of energy to sell based on the rewards received and their associated costs. Additionally, a demand response (DR) mechanism is integrated to enhance community self-sufficiency. We develop three algorithms to maximize the welfare of the community. The first algorithm incorporates a DR program and generation constraints to keep the EC competitive with grid prices over time. The second and third algorithms use replicator dynamics (RD) to find equilibria that optimize the system&apos;s welfare, using Lagrangian relaxation to handle the model constraints.We integrate the models for sellers and buyers via a system of differential equations that simulate a Stackelberg game. Additionally, a filtering mechanism is employed to improve convergence and reduce computation time. We validate the EMS in a case study, showing that the proposed approach achieves greater self-sufficiency compared to a system without demand response and enables better resource management, enhanced fairness, and a more equitable distribution of benefits compared to a non-hierarchical and decoupled model."}}

To address the challenge, robust frequency support of wind farms (WFs) is introduced in this paper, aiming for rapid and reliable load restoration. First, a collaborative mechanism for WFs to participate in frequency support along with energy storage system (ESSs) and SGs is analyzed, aiming to tap their potential in accelerating load restoration. Accordingly, a load restoration framework incorporating the frequency support capability of WFs is proposed, together with a corresponding two-stage robust optimization model. Especially, an uncertainty model of wind farm frequency regulation considering the impact of the first-stage decision is established, which depicts the coupling relationship between the frequency reserve threshold of WFs and the uncertainty of their frequency support capabilities. At last, the parametric column-and-constraint generation (PCCG) algorithm is tailored to efficiently solve the proposed model, where the extreme points and rays of the recourse problem can parametrically represent the decision-dependent scenarios. Case studies on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model and algorithm."}}

However, current approaches encounter several challenges in optimizing OOD detection performance: (1) They struggle to accurately delineate the boundary between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, especially when there are significant differences between auxiliary data and real OOD data distributions; (2) Feature optimization is often constrained to a single scale, limiting the effective integration of local and global feature advantages. (3) Traditional classification strategies rely on fixed thresholds, making it difficult to handle highly uncertain samples, which compromises classification robustness. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Adaptive Distribution Sphere Framework (ADSF), which significantly enhances OOD detection performance through dynamic boundary adjustment, multi-scale feature fusion, and energy optimization. Leveraging dynamic feature modeling and optimization strategies, ADSF offers a highly efficient and robust solution for OOD detection in complex environments. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world OOD datasets (e.g., SVHN, LSUN, iSUN) demonstrate that ADSF effectively reduces the false positive rate (FPR95) and improves the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Compared to existing methods, ADSF exhibits superior robustness and generalization capability, making it an efficient and versatile solution for OOD detection tasks in challenging environments."}}

The results reveal substantial heterogeneity in efficiency dynamics. Since early 2023, the CEA and Shenzhen have shown improved efficiency and stability, while the EUA and other pilot markets have experienced declines in efficiency and increased volatility. Despite progress in domestic markets’ efficiency, the EUA remains the primary source of efficiency spillover effects, followed by the CEA, Shenzhen, and Beijing, whereas other pilot markets—particularly Shanghai—act mainly as net recipients. Spillover intensity increases significantly during major regulatory periods, especially around China’s annual “Two Sessions,” highlighting the influence of policy signals on market linkages. These findings offer empirical insights into the time-varying transmission of efficiency under institutional reform and inform the coordinated design of carbon trading policies."}}

We controlled for household and spatial characteristics and addressed the endogeneity of vehicle availability by employing a weighted Structural Equation Model (SEM). Using the same model specification, we also modelled households’ allocation of vehicles for three specific business purposes: ridesharing, delivery services, and others. Our results indicate that vehicle availability exerts a positive influence on households’ allocation of vehicles for general business purposes, while it has a negative influence on allocation for rideshare purposes. Furthermore, white households are more likely to assign their vehicles for all business uses except ridesharing and delivery services. Conversely, households with younger members are more inclined to allocate vehicles for rideshare and delivery services but are less likely to do so for other business purposes. Low-income households demonstrate a higher propensity to use their vehicles for delivery services, yet they are less likely to use their vehicles for other business purposes. The results of our study have significant implications for transportation planners, policymakers, and business operators who encourage the use of personal vehicles for business purposes."}}

The principle posits that when access to a desirable group-such as employable professionals or attractive dating candidatesis made conditional on certain behaviors, users increasingly conform to the platform's implicit or explicit expectations. Over time, this dynamic fosters a pattern of unconditional obedience to platform norms, even in the absence of meaningful outcomes. Drawing on case studies from labor and dating markets, the paper argues that users continue to invest time and effort into platforms that fail to deliver tangible success-not because of irrationality, but because of the structural conditions created by the platforms themselves. These conditions include algorithmic opacity, asymmetric feedback, and manufactured scarcity, which collectively erode agency and incentivize behavioral compliance. While many platforms present themselves as neutral or meritocratic intermediaries, they often function as gatekeepers that shape the terms of visibility, legitimacy, and participation. As a result, users adapt not to succeed on their own terms, but to remain eligible within a system that controls access to critical resources like employment, connection, or recognition. Conditional Belonging 2 The analysis situates the Conditional Belonging Principle within broader academic discussions on algorithmic governance, behavioral nudging, and platform-mediated trust. It concludes that meaningful reform is unlikely to emerge from within dominant platforms, whose business models often depend on sustained engagement rather than successful user outcomes.

While previous research has focused on employees&apos; demand for it, we make a contribution by studying firms&apos; supply of training. In our vignette study, 1,144 managers evaluate hypothetical candidate profiles that differ by gender, age, competence, job mobility, and training characteristics. We find that women are somewhat more likely than men to receive training offers. The exceptions are that female managers are more reluctant to choose young women for training, while male managers favor male candidates for fully employer-funded training. These patterns persist across various model specifications and remain robust when controlling for observable manager characteristics. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that female managers are more reluctant to offer training to women when they operate in competitive product markets, male-dominated industries, and firms without collective bargaining agreements. More broadly, our results highlight that managers influence not only how much training is undertaken, but also how training opportunities are distributed among employees."}}

The article considers the debate over open source versus proprietary models, where high compute costs and corporate investment distinguish AI from traditional software. It examines the distinctions between general-purpose and specific-purpose AI. Cybersecurity threats, like prompt injection, increase the risks of data exfiltration, which may necessitate legal clarity on liability, especially in agentic AI systems. Competition policy issues arise as incumbent firms integrate AI services, potentially stifling startups if large firms engage in anticompetitive practices. At the same time, autonomous agents employed by both small and large firms could unintentionally facilitate algorithmic collusion by independently converging on pricing strategies that may cause antitrust injury. Workforce effects of agentic AI may lead to uneven impacts, with benefits for some and displacement for others, requiring reimagined workplace roles.

This paper attempts to investigate the role of AI in personalized marketing. AI altogether changes the perspective in which companies interact with their consumers. AI enables businesses to acquire profound insights into individual preferences, behaviors, and purchase history by facilitating the accumulation and analysis of vast consumer data. Organizations can enhance user experiences, improve conversion rates, and promote customer engagement by implementing hyper-personalization strategies that leverage machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, AI enables marketers to automate processes such as targeted advertising, brand promotion, content recommendations, and real-time decision-making, thereby optimizing the customer journey across multiple channels and streamlining marketing efforts. Nevertheless, the introduction of AI into marketing also raises significant concerns about data privacy and the potential for overreliance on automated systems, requiring a balanced approach that balances human interaction with technology. To effectively implement AI-driven personalized marketing, it is essential to prioritize ethical considerations and user trust while embracing technological advancements as the digital marketing landscape continues to evolve. No doubt, AI is revolutionizing marketing personalization across the world."}}

Such uncertainty can discourage purchases by consumers who are averse to mismatch risk, ultimately harming both consumers and product firms. We show that P2P rental markets can mitigate the adverse effects of such uncertainty. Specifically, P2P rental markets incentivize consumers who are less sensitive to preference mismatches to participate in the market as early lenders (sometimes prosumers). This, in turn, enables consumers with high product valuations to learn about product preferences during the early stages, thereby enhancing consumer surplus. Moreover, the informative role of P2P rental markets enhances the value of product ownership, leading to higher product prices and potentially even greater demand, which also benefits product firms."}}

This study builds on recent developments in CTR and CVR modeling by examining how video versus static image ads can shape user experience and subsequent conversions. Specifically, we propose an integrative approach that combines qualitative user feedback with next-generation predictive models (such as Deep Multi-Interest Networks and Entire Space Multi-Task frameworks) to address critical issues like freerider bias and overfitting. Unlike broad, one-size-fits-all approaches, we focus on small to midsized e-commerce businesses, which often have limited resources yet stand to benefit most from targeted ad optimization. We outline a mixed-method design that gathers real-time data on user engagement and conversion paths across multiple ad formats. By analyzing online consumer interactions-both quantitatively (through advanced model performance metrics) and qualitatively (via user feedback on ad experience)-we aim to illuminate best practices for boosting CTR and driving genuine conversion. Additionally, we propose testing adaptive user segmentation based on evolving interests and employing low-intrusiveness design to balance engagement with user comfort. Potential research outcomes include improved accuracy in predicting purchase intent, reduced model overfitting, and actionable insights on when and how video ads outperform static creatives. This work offers a foundation for more precise, contextaware advertising strategies, ultimately helping e-commerce SMEs align their marketing spend with measurable, trust-building consumer engagement."}}

This study examines the interconnections between personal norms, green purchase intention, consumer buying processes, and post-purchase outcomes. The research investigates how personal norms shape green purchase intention and how consumer satisfaction and scepticism influence continued green consumption. The study also explores the role of greenwashing in fueling scepticism and alternative evaluation in influencing purchase satisfaction. Employing a correlational research design, data were collected through a structured questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. A pilot study confirmed the reliability of adapted scales, and statistical analyses were conducted to determine relationships between the following key variables: Personal norms, green purchase intention, green choice, satisfaction, alternative evaluation, greenwashing, and consumer scepticism. It further analysed variations across socio-demographic factors such as gender, area of residence, and income groups. Findings reveal that personal norms significantly influence green purchase intention, which in turn impacts satisfaction. Satisfaction positively correlates with consumer scepticism, highlighting the complexity of green consumption. Additionally, alternative evaluation is linked to both satisfaction and scepticism, suggesting that consumers reassess their choices in response to market inconsistencies. Mediation analyses demonstrate that green purchase intention partially mediates the relationship between personal norms and green purchases, while consumer scepticism mediates the relationship between alternative evaluation and both satisfaction and green purchase behaviour. This research contributes to the existing literature by elucidating the psychological and behavioural mechanisms underlying green purchase decisions. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and marketers to develop strategies that enhance consumer trust, reduce scepticism, and promote sustainable consumption.\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>"}}

In response, DCPs have started to combine these two models by offering a two-tier menu: a free ad-supported tier for price-sensitive users and a paid ad-free tier for ad-sensitive users. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Ad-Supported Subscription (GAS) mechanism-a broad class consisting of subscription-fee and ad-intensity combinations that spans the entire spectrum from fully ad-supported to fully subscription-based access. Using the principles of mechanism design, we characterize a revenue-maximizing GAS mechanism and contrast it with ad-only, subscription-only, and the two-tier menu. Further, we estimate our model parameters and empirically validate our theoretical results in the context of Video-on-Demand platforms. Our analysis shows that the optimal GAS mechanism yields a substantially higher revenue than the ad-only and subscription-only mechanisms. More importantly, this additional revenue improvement does not come at the expense of consumer surplus-this shows that the GAS mechanism improves the overall economic pie by better matching user preferences."}}

Using rich Swedish administrative data and a sibling fixed effects design, we find that non-cognitive ability-a key dimension of parenting skills-has become an increasingly strong predictor of fatherhood over time, even after controlling for marriage, earnings, and partner characteristics. We further exploit a 2002 reform that expanded reserved paternity leave to show that increased expectations for paternal involvement amplify selection on non-cognitive ability.

To formalize this approach, we model an agent under cognitive load allocating effort between working unassisted and prompting an AI assistant. The theoretical model demonstrates that an agent's optimal prompting effort is driven by their attitude towards risk. Specifically, the model proves that risk-averse agents rationally \"over-invest\" in prompting effort, while risk-loving agents \"under-invest.\" This outcome stems from the covariance between the marginal utility of performance and the marginal product of prompting. This alignment is positive for risk-averse agents, effectively boosting the AI's perceived productivity. The novel implication is that prompting effort is a rich economic behavior that can be used to reveal an individual's underlying risk preferences.

Exploiting the 2006 to 2019 panel dynamics of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey data, we implement empirical strategies that account for the historical role of previous-period employment and previous-period body mass on current employment. We uncover less than compelling evidence that individuals carrying excess body mass (as measured by body mass index, BMI) are less likely to be employed in Australia. Results from the dynamic correlated random effects probit, which imposes an auxiliary distributional assumption on unobserved time-constant heterogeneity, disclose negative associations between BMI (as a categorical or continuous variable) and employment. When the auxiliary assumption is relaxed through the generalised methods of moment (GMM) procedure, none of the body mass coefficients attain statistical significance. Conducting a granular analysis by gender groups, no association between excess body mass and employment is evident, regardless of the empirical strategy that is adopted. Investigating the channels of effect, while the results reveal a role for health-related productivity difference as a source of excess body mass-related employment penalty for women, the finding does not hold when the GMM procedure is implemented. Overall, we fail to garner fully convincing evidence that excess body mass reduces individuals’ employment prospects in Australia, though the converse cannot be ruled out."}}

In these settings, the value of digital consumption depends not only on the intrinsic quality of the product but also on social influences among consumers, presenting new challenges for firms: reduced direct control over product value and increased uncertainty in real-time user experience. Therefore, it is essential for firms to understand how social interaction reshapes market demand and how to strategically manage this dynamic to improve profitability. To address these questions, we develop a continuous-time model in which a consumer's willingness to pay for the product is dynamically determined by both their idiosyncratic value and social interactions with other consumers. Our findings show that social interactions rotate demand distribution and create an additional option value of participation. Moreover, upward and downward social influences have an asymmetric impact on the option value of and the firm's profit. We characterize how the firm adjusts participation threshold and access pricing depending on how the option value varies with marginal consumer types. We compare equilibrium demand and profit to the benchmark scenario without social interactions."}}

Notably, the concept of \"embeddedness\", central to Polanyi's contribution, oqers a valuable perspective to trace the development of this regulatory mechanism over time. The social and political concerns of an emerging industrial society marked the birth of competition policy as a device for embedding the early 20 th-century market economy. However, in the following decades, new market fundamentalist narratives disembedded markets, with competition policy contributing to this process by deviating from its non-market origins. Today, this governance tool faces the challenges of 21 stcentury civilization, with the celebrated consensus on its principles long lost. New social and political concerns arising from market power demand the re-embedment of markets through competition. This article explores this Polanyian dynamic of embeddedness-disembeddedness-re-embeddedness by reframing the history of competition policy in diqerent institutional realities-the United States, the EU, and Brazil. It also discusses how diverse institutional conditions shaped alternative responses towards market fundamentalism throughout the past century. The revival of Polanyi's ideas not only helps us understand how we arrived here but also provides important insights into the inevitable role that \"nonmarket\" dimensions play in the reform agenda currently surrounding competition policy."}}

The new rules took effect August 17, 2024. The biggest change is that listings may no longer make offers of compensation to a buyer agent on any NAR-affiliated multiple listing service (MLS). Furthermore, a buyer's agent must now have a written contract with a home shopper, clearly specifying their fee, before they may show that client a house. This study employs regression analyses on a national dataset of home sales transactions to evaluate the policy's effect on real estate transaction valuation and probability of transaction failure. Shifting the commission responsibility to buyers could lead to notable changes in transaction values as buyers adjust their budgets to cover the added expense of agent fees. Furthermore, because buyer agent commissions are no longer bundled into the home's purchase price and cannot, currently, be financed through the mortgage, buyers may face increased out-of-pocket expenses at closing, which could raise the likelihood of transaction failure."}}

We exploit the staggered implementation of CE requirements by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) to examine the impact of CE. While we do not find evidence that CE requirements impact average investment advisers, we find that CE requirements significantly reduce misconduct among high-risk advisers. This reduction in misconduct is concentrated in rules-based misconduct. We also find that CE requirements remain effective within firm environments prone to misconduct. These findings suggest that CE can serve as an effective regulatory tool to discipline bad actors in financial markets and should interest regulators who are concerned with maintaining professional competency through continuing education requirements."}}

We build a life-cycle general equilibrium model in which individuals choose their education level and occupational path under limited tax enforcement and financial frictions.

Calibrated to Brazil, the model predicts that increasing college attainment significantly reduces informality, primarily by reallocating entrepreneurial talent toward larger, more productive, and formal firms. These firm-level adjustments translate into higher GDP per capita and aggregate productivity, with the magnitude of these effects depending on the severity of credit market imperfections. Overall, our results highlight a novel mechanism linking human capital accumulation to formalization and suggest that relaxing both credit and education constraints is essential for development.

In this respect, laboratory experiments show that peer punishment is an effective cooperation-enhancing instrument. However, it is unclear whether peer punishment would facilitate cooperation and public good provision even under congruent heterogeneities in wealth and punishment effectiveness. To this end, we experimentally study the effect of peer punishment under joint heterogeneities, where either the richest or the poorest member is also the most effective punisher. We compare these joint heterogeneities to treatments with single heterogeneities in either endowment or punishment effectiveness and to a baseline symmetry treatment with homogeneous parties. We find that heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness does not matter for cooperation, whereas endowment heterogeneity reduces cooperation compared to symmetry. This is because rich members contribute a lower portion of their endowment to the public good than their poorer counterparts. We also observe that cooperation is higher under joint heterogeneities in endowment and punishment effectiveness than under endowment heterogeneity (with no differences than under symmetry). This holds even when the rich party gains less from cooperation and is the most effective punisher."}}

This study critically examines the role of social media in Nigeria's democratization process and the promotion of good governance from the return to civilian rule in 1999 to the present. Focusing on platforms such as Twitter (now X), Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube, the research explores how these digital spaces have fostered political participation, civic engagement, and interaction between citizens and government institutions. The study aims to: assess the extent to which social media has facilitated democratization, advance good governance and identify the challenges associated with leveraging social media. Adopting a qualitative research design, the study utilizes documentary analysis of secondary sources, including scholarly articles, media reports, policy documents, and official records. The study employs SWOT and PESTEL frameworks to evaluate the internal and external factors shaping the use of social media in Nigeria's democratic landscape. Findings indicate that social media has played a significant role in enhancing democratic awareness, improving transparency, and empowering youth-led activism. Nevertheless, issues such as misinformation, online censorship, surveillance, and digital exclusion remain persistent obstacles. The study concludes that while social media does not replace conventional democratic institutions, it has become an essential complement to participatory governance. It recommends policy reforms, improved digital literacy, increased platform accountability, and inclusive stakeholder engagement to harness the full democratic potential of social media in Nigeria."}}

Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 229 respondents across the country to examine the socio-demographic and psychographic factors influencing willingness and reluctance to consume rabbit meat. Respondents were categorized into three consumption segments, the have consumed, not consumed but willing, and not consumed and not willing. Chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regression (MNL) were used to identify associations and significant predictors of consumption behavior. Bivariate analysis showed strong associations between consumption segments and gender, age, and employment status. Women and older individuals were more likely to resist rabbit meat consumption, while young adults and males showed greater openness. Remarkably, consumption was highest among low-income groups, suggesting informal access and challenging assumptions that rabbit is a premium meat. The pooled MNL model showed the best fit, confirming that consumption is shaped not only by economic constraints but also by culturally embedded perceptions and emotional discomfort. Economic constraints and awareness increased both willingness and actual consumption, while psychological and cultural barriers significantly reduced them. The findings highlight that increasing rabbit meat acceptance requires more than awareness campaigns. It necessitates emotionally intelligent, culturally sensitive strategies that reframe rabbit meat's identity. Effective interventions must segment audiences based on gender, age, and economic context while addressing culturally and psychologically ingrained aversions. This study contributes to the growing body of behavioral food research and provides actionable insights for promoting alternative proteins in traditionally reluctant markets."}}

Drawing on a 1,934-page documentary corpus analysed in NVivo and framed by Human Capital Theory, Innovation Diffusion, and Post-colonial Pedagogy, we benchmarked IBT against seven flagship business programmes across five sub-regions. The resulting Curriculum Alignment Index (CAI) places IBT at 7.9-roughly double the peer mean of 4.0 (t = 21.32, p &lt; .001; Cohen's d = 8.06) owing to its 90 % Africa-centric content, 65 % experiential hours and 80 % blended delivery. Early graduate signals corroborate this curricular edge. A six-month tracer (n = 22) found 72 % of alumni working in AfCFTA-related sectors, a median first-year salary of US$10,473-five times the regional graduate average-and an employer Net Promoter Score of +86. These outcomes suggest that IBT graduates act as immediate implementation agents, diffusing trade-facilitation know-how within logistics firms, chambers of commerce and policy secretariats. Methodologically, the study combines comparative programme review, inferential statistics, and thematic coding to offer the first empirically grounded evaluation of an AfCFTA-aligned business curriculum. Practically, it identifies five low-cost, high-leverage design elements-including a Pan-African case-study bank and a two-stage internship loop-that can be replicated across African higher-education institutions. We conclude that ALU-IBT provides a scalable blueprint for closing Africa's trade-skills gap and accelerating continental economic integration. Future research should test these findings longitudinally through the programme's five-year monitoring and evaluation roadmap, which captures graduate AfCFTAengagement indices and capstone adoption rates."}}

Drawing on information from tax filings, we examine employment tenure, firm affiliation, industry, occupation, income, and demographic characteristics. Our findings reveal that most American expatriates work for foreign rather than US-based employers, that long-term residence abroad is common, and that self-employment rates vary substantially by region and income levels by employer type. Modest gender differences also emerge. These patterns depart from traditional models of corporate-initiated expatriation and point to a more multifaceted and decentralized structure of American global labor market participation, with implications for research, corporate practice, and policy."}}

Consistent with our theoretical framework, we find that interval funds significantly outperform both passive and active ETFs in illiquid and information-insensitive asset categories, particularly non-traditional fixed-income investments, even after fees and expenses. However, interval funds underperform ETFs in liquid and information-sensitive equity categories, highlighting potential agency conflicts stemming from reduced market-based managerial incentives. Additionally, we document investor-level externalities: interval funds that offer institutional share classes outperform retail-only funds, and flows into institutional classes predict incremental future returns relative to retail flows, indicating superior selection skill among sophisticated investors. Finally, the structured liquidity of interval funds results in improved investor timing decisions relative to daily-tradable ETFs, further underscoring the benefits of limited liquidity."}}

Instead, companies submit large numbers of diverse discussion papers, and consensus emerges gradually. Here, we show that it is possible and useful to identify different categories of RAN1 discussion papers (“Research Papers”, “Position Papers”, and “Summaries”), and we show how to account for double-counting of contributions. Further work is needed to account for heterogeneity between contributions in terms of complexity, novelty, and impact.&nbsp;"}}

Our micro-econometric analysis provides fresh evidence that households in provinces with better institutions are more likely to receive larger formal loans, and have bank accounts, savings books, and ATM cards. Also, wage earners living in provinces with higher quality institutions are more likely to be covered by compulsory social insurance.

There have been significant international institutional climate change policy drivers to harness a global effort to reduce adverse anthropogenic (humaninduced) effects on the climate system. Following the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and then the Paris Agreement (2015) many countries have adopted carbon pricing policies with various mechanisms that in combination had achieved coverage of some 28 per cent. of global carbon emissions by 2025 according to the World Bank. There are both mandatory and voluntary carbon markets that are effectively specialised human-construct commodity markets. Carbon pricing has encouraged structured financial engineering based on measured carbon emissions in different jurisdictions. Further research will be necessary to assess whether the progress in carbon pricing and carbon markets is sufficiently effective in achieving positive outcomes at national and global levels. Governments may face increasing pressure to consider the balance between carbon pricing policies and promotion of carbon management technologies especially if the latter prove to be more effective and/or acceptable to businesses and the wider public. This paper identifies some controversies and challenges in the development of carbon pricing and concludes with a consideration of important issues to address in the future."}}

Notably, the concept of \"embeddedness\", central to Polanyi's contribution, oqers a valuable perspective to trace the development of this regulatory mechanism over time. The social and political concerns of an emerging industrial society marked the birth of competition policy as a device for embedding the early 20 th-century market economy. However, in the following decades, new market fundamentalist narratives disembedded markets, with competition policy contributing to this process by deviating from its non-market origins. Today, this governance tool faces the challenges of 21 stcentury civilization, with the celebrated consensus on its principles long lost. New social and political concerns arising from market power demand the re-embedment of markets through competition. This article explores this Polanyian dynamic of embeddedness-disembeddedness-re-embeddedness by reframing the history of competition policy in diqerent institutional realities-the United States, the EU, and Brazil. It also discusses how diverse institutional conditions shaped alternative responses towards market fundamentalism throughout the past century. The revival of Polanyi's ideas not only helps us understand how we arrived here but also provides important insights into the inevitable role that \"nonmarket\" dimensions play in the reform agenda currently surrounding competition policy."}}

It is mainly concerned with the environmental impact assessments and also on the human activities that have harmful effects on the natural environment. Monitoring strategies and programmes are generally designed to establish the current status of an environment or to establish a baseline and trends in environmental parameters. Many monitoring programmes are designed to not only establish the current state of the environment but also predict future conditions. One such monitoring program is giving focus to Social Forestry. Everyone is aware that without an environment it is difficult to survive. If we save nature, nature will save us. If we don’t preserve the trees, future generations cannot survive and they do not get fresh air to breathe. Everyone should cultivate the habit of gardening and a lot of efforts should be made by the people to protect the environment and also to save nature. As forests are the most inevitable natural resources it is the duty of every citizen to protect the environment. Social Forestry should be given much importance as it involves community participation and also serves as the main source of livelihood for local people. Management of social forestry should be the main objective of society as the human population is heavily dependent on forest resources. Efforts should be initiated by the government, NGOs, officials, and people in this regard."}}

Could the study of consumer goods improve our collective understanding of what constitutes unlawful discrimination, including how evidence is admitted in U.S. federal courts? A possible answer, which is informed by the historical record, is toys and related consumer goods may improve our collective understanding for three reasons.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n The first reason is studying consumer goods provides a window into how society views African Americans, perhaps due to its unique ability to capture the revealed preferences of individuals. Another reason is the study of consumer goods offers a relatively safe distance from which to draw conclusions about how transaction-level decisions impact U.S. public policies and&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n practices. A third reason is the study of consumer goods validates calls for additional government intervention, so as to remove unrecognized barriers to full participation in ostensibly free markets.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Such interventions, often, seek to improve efficiency rather than to limit unlawful discrimination. Nonetheless, these reforms frequently assure that Black folks are treated just like everybody else. For these reasons, among others, this author encourages scholars and practitioners to make greater use of transaction-level information (i.e., information generated in the normal course of business).&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Race-neutral government interventions, such as Professor Jasmine Gonzalez Rose’s useful suggestions about how the Federal Rules Of Evidence should be applied going forward, may serve as a less-than-salient way to remove hidden barriers to full participation. One way to implement these suggested reforms is to make much greater use of transaction-level information. Transaction-level information is any data that is generated in the normal course of business such as a seller’s purchasing data (i.e., what they buy), a seller’s profit-market information (i.e., net effects) or a buyer’s feedback (i.e., compliments or complaints, which arise from buyer-seller transactions).&nbsp;\n</div>"}}

Here, we report the first detection of endocrine-disrupting phenol derivatives: bisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenol as well as microplastics in Fe-Mn nodules from the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Phenol concentrations were 5–151 times higher in nodules than in sediments below. We identified 29 microplastic particles, dominated by industrial polymers such as neoprene and chlorosulfonated polyethylene.

We present a comprehensive multi-state network model that integrates utility-based behavioral transitions with adaptive network rewiring, capturing the co-evolutionary dynamics between drug use patterns and social structure. Our framework distinguishes four distinct individual states by combining drug use behavior with addiction status, while allowing individuals to strategically disconnect from drug-using neighbors and form new connections with non-users. Monte Carlo simulations show that rewiring reshapes contagion, pulling high-degree nodes into drug-free clusters and stranding users on sparse fringes. Systematic exploration of the four-dimensional parameter space reveals sharp phase transitions reminiscent of critical phenomena in statistical physics, where small changes in recovery rates or addiction conversion rates trigger dramatic shifts in population-level outcomes. Most significantly, the rewiring probability emerges as the dominant control parameter, establishing adaptive network management as more influential than biological susceptibility factors in determining addiction prevalence. Our findings challenge traditional intervention paradigms by revealing that empowering individuals to curate their social environments may be more effective than targeting individual behavioral change alone."}}

This paper proposes an integrative conceptual framework of Sustainable Team Dynamics (STD) that brings together constructs from organizational behavior, team science, and positive psychology. Grounded in Social Exchange Theory, IMOI (Input–Mediator–Output–Input) model and psychological safety models, the framework posits that factors such as organizational culture, team composition, task characteristics, and social capital shape psychological safety and resilience, which in turn influence team performance and long-term sustainability. To strengthen the theoretical model, a survey of 448 team members was conducted using a structured 24-item Likert questionnaire mapped to eight latent constructs. Descriptive statistics confirmed high internal agreement on team functioning, and correlation analyses supported the model’s directional expectations. Organizational culture, psychological safety and resilience emerged as key predictors of performance, retention and sustainability. These results strengthen the empirical credibility of the STD framework and reinforce its potential for guiding leadership development and sustainable team-building strategies. The paper concludes with implications for leadership development and sustainable HR practices, directions for further validation and practical implementation.</span>"}}

This study interrogates the regulatory frictions that slow PAPSS uptake in Rwanda, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria and quantifies the opportunity cost of inaction for the wider continent's trade agenda. [2] Design/methodology/approach-We integrate institutional, diffusion-ofinnovation and resource-dependence theory within a mixed-methods design. An AI-assisted content analysis of more than 80 statutory texts produces a sixdimension Regulatory Readiness Index (RRI), while an augmented Poisson gravity model, calibrated with World Bank and Afreximbank data, simulates trade gains under alternative cost-reduction scenarios. [3] Findings-Currency-convertibility restrictions, divergent KYC/AML thresholds and data-localisation clauses emerge as the most binding constraints. RRI scores range from 56.7 (Nigeria) to 65.0 (Kenya), explaining crosscountry variance in early PAPSS transaction volumes. Full PAPSS roll-out coupled with moderate regulatory harmonisation could trim average payment costs by 40-50 %, raising bilateral intra-African trade by 10-30 % within the next decade. [4] Research implications-By empirically isolating how coercive, mimetic and resource logics condition payment-system diffusion, the paper advances theorisation of fintech integration in emerging markets and offers a replicable AIenhanced methodology for regulatory benchmarking. [5] Practical implications-Policymakers should prioritise phased FX liberalisation, mutual KYC recognition and a pan-African fintech-passport regime; without these reforms, AfCFTA's digital-trade protocol risks underdelivery. [6] Originality/value-This is the first multi-country investigation to fuse AIdriven regulatory analytics with econometric trade modelling, delivering an evidence-based roadmap for an interoperable African payments union and a template for future digital-trade research."}}

However, not all dialysis patients presenting to the ED require hospitalization. Accurately predicting hospitalization needs for these patients, especially those transported by ambulance, is essential for effective resource allocation and timely intervention.Methods: This study analyzed a cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, from January 2014 to July 2018. The dataset included 879 hemodialysis ambulance transports to the ED, and several predictors of hospitalization based on assessments by paramedics prior to transport, including vital signs, chief complaint, age, sex, and the number of days from the last dialysis treatment. We utilized machine learning (ML) methods, including random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, XG-Boost, and neural network, addressing class imbalance through internal and external balancing techniques to provide accurate and reliable risk prediction models for hospitalization. To ensure the interpretability and transparency of model decisions, Explainable AI (XAI) methods, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), were integrated into the analysis.Results: The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.77 and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.84 for hospitalization following ED transport. Integrating XAI methods (LIME and SHAP) provided insights into model-driven decision-making processes, highlighting key clinical predictors influencing subsequent hospitalization after ambulance transport to the ED,  such as higher heart rate, lower blood pressure, lower oxygen saturation, and lower Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) score.Conclusion: Machine learning models, particularly XGBoost combined with Explainable AI techniques, effectively predict hospitalization needs of hemodialysis patients following ambulance transport to ED."}}

While these resources can provide immediate solutions, they often come from unverified sources and lack the context necessary for correct application. This growing dependence on readily available, sometimes ill-advised, information can lead to significant missteps, including inefficient code, flawed methodologies, or incorrect conclusions. As a result, researchers may unwittingly propagate errors or overlook more robust, appropriate solutions that are crucial for scientific progress. This paper presents the integration of the Quantlet and Quantinar platforms, collectively referred to as the Q2 ecosystem, aimed at overcoming challenges faced by applied scientists and researchers due to the vast and fragmented array of data and code available online. The focus of this integration is to enhance accessibility and usability of academic resources by effectively linking research with pertinent code and datasets. The study introduces an adaptive clustering algorithm that organizes and dynamically groups academic content from Quantinar alongside code and computational results from Quantlet, thus linking academic theory and practice. With these technical advancements, the Q2 framework aspires to enhance transparency and reproducibility within the academic research landscape. Ultimately, it aims to provide a cohesive learning environment that meets the evolving needs of the academic community, empowering researchers in their pursuit of knowledge and facilitating deeper insights into complex data-driven methodologies."}}

We consider sectoral dynamic interactions of quantities and prices in markets after shocks. The issue here is then to what extent do prices and quantities change when there are quantity shocks. On the other hand, how sizable are the price and quantity effects when there are price shocks? New Keynesian literature refers to the monopolistic competition theory and the Lerner measure, capturing demand elasticity, and relies on expected future marginal costs and markups, studying equilibrium relative price change. Instead of using this proposition, or partially assuming or estimating elasticities, we undertake here model-guided econometric VAR and CIVAR estimations, to understand the size of the interaction effects of quantity and price shocks in markets not necessarily in equilibrium, but when market variables have moved below or above some trends. As to the energy transition, we show that in higher carbon intensity sectors&nbsp; prices and quantities move differently as compared to less carbon-intensive sectors. As we demonstrate, the relative quantity and price changes show sectoral dependency – the price and quantity shock responses are dependent on the carbon intensity of the sectors.&nbsp;"}}

These concepts are frequently invoked in political debates to support social and economic reforms. However, they are often infused with meanings that advance specific political—rather than policy—agendas, thereby threatening the very values they claim to uphold: justice, fairness, and equality. Policies related to the allocation of the tax burden and the redistribution of tax revenues are particularly susceptible to such manipulations. Drawing on extensive debates in political philosophy and economics, the article explores how perceptions of fairness have historically shaped the relationship between governments and taxpayers. Rather than aiming to resolve the moral debates surrounding tax policy, it reopens the question of whether—and to what extent—meritocratic and desert-based principles should inform taxation. In particular, it examines potential solutions for repurposing the normative justifications for meritocratic taxation to address the limitations of meritocracy. The article argues that meritocratic taxation can remain a valuable policy tool when coupled with an analysis of the economic efficiency and behavioral impact of the measure. Ultimately, this article seeks to preserve the philosophical coherence of certain existing tax measures while offering a normative framework for future reforms that is independent of an (often imperfect) justice-based rationale.</p>"}}

I begin with a simple dynamic model when firms face tenure-based adjustment costs and anticipate higher future liabilities. The model predicts that firms respond by adjusting the composition of their workforce. I test these predictions exploiting the 2012 introduction of mandatory ultractivity in Brazilian collective bargaining agreements, which extended the terms of expired contracts until a new one is signed. Using staggered treatment timing and a difference-indifferences design, I find that firms after exposure to an ultractivity CBA reduce hiring by 9%, with no change in overall separations. However, separations rise among hightenure and production workers and fall among low-tenure employees. The findings support model's prediction and suggest that stronger union protections can lead to unintended firm behavior, with trade-offs between job security and employment opportunities."}}

By comparing the development of STEM/STEAM with the historical evolution of European educational systems, the study demonstrates that these modern educational models are deeply rooted in philosophical and scientific traditions.

Traditional marketing approaches rooted in economic rationality are increasingly challenged by the complex dynamics of contemporary consumer behavior, competitive agility, and technological acceleration. This paper proposes an integrative framework that synthesizes econometrics, machine learning, and game theory to support innovation-driven decision-making in strategic marketing and entrepreneurial contexts. Econometrics provides a rigorous foundation for understanding demand, pricing elasticity, and market structure through empirical data analysis. However, its static assumptions and linear logic often fall short in capturing non-linear consumer patterns. Machine learning addresses this limitation by enabling real-time, adaptive insights from unstructured and high-dimensional data. Its predictive power enhances segmentation, personalization, and retention strategies, allowing firms to navigate volatile markets with greater precision. Complementing both is game theory, which models strategic interdependencies among market actors. From pricing wars to innovation races, game-theoretic logic uncovers the deeper strategic incentives that drive decision-making under uncertainty and competition. This triadic integration enables firms not only to anticipate market movements but also to proactively design markets that align innovation, value creation, and competitive advantage in ways that can foster sustainable and socially responsible outcomes. The article develops a conceptual and methodological synthesis, using simulation and real-world data to compare the effectiveness of the integrated approach versus traditional methods. Findings indicate that strategic decisions informed by this integrative lens lead to higher agility, more robust innovation pathways, and improved performance metrics across diverse sectors, including those advancing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. This research contributes to the emerging discourse on smart marketing ecosystems, responsible innovation, and computational decision-making. It invites scholars and practitioners to&nbsp;reconceptualize market design not merely as reactive forecasting, but as an intelligent, adaptive, and ethically-informed strategic process that can directly support sustainable and responsible investing."}}

Emphasizing simplicity, speed, and market relevance, relative valuation estimates a firm's value by comparing its financial multiples to those of peer companies. Unlike intrinsic valuation methods that require forecasting future cash flows, this approach leverages observable market data-such as price-to-earnings (P/E), EV/EBITDA, and price-to-book (P/B) ratios-to infer fair value. The book meticulously outlines the strengths and limitations of each multiple, provides guidance on industry-specific metrics, and highlights the critical importance of selecting appropriate peer groups. Through Excel-based modeling, readers learn to construct valuation tables, perform scenario and sensitivity analyses, and derive valuation ranges with practical implications. A full case study on Dabur India Ltd. illustrates the real-world application of multiple-based valuation, reinforcing key concepts and emphasizing the role of judgment in financial modeling. This work is especially relevant in emerging markets where intrinsic valuation inputs are often unreliable, and market-based multiples offer a practical alternative. Overall, the guide bridges academic principles and practitioner tools, making it a valuable resource for students, analysts, and corporate finance professionals."}}

While retirement offers greater utility per unit of consumption but lower income, reemployment entails both financial and psychological costs, creating trade-offs that influence optimal decision-making. Building on the utility-based frameworks of Farhi and Panageas (2007) and Dybvig and Liu (2010), we extend the model to allow return-to-work options, incorporating switching costs and capturing richer utility dynamics. Using a dual-martingale approach, we reformulate the problem into an optimal switching problem, which leads to a system of variational inequalities characterizing the optimal strategies. Our analysis highlights how switching costs, utility gains from retirement, and income structures jointly shape retirement and reemployment behavior. Numerical results further illustrate the implications of partial reversibility, bridging the gap between irreversible and fully reversible retirement models."}}

This fundamental discipline bridges the gap between investment theory and practical wealth preservation, serving as the primary mechanism through which investors control risk while optimizing returns. Whether for individual investors, hedge fund managers, or institutional portfolio managers, position sizing plays a critical role in preserving capital, optimizing returns, and navigating the inherent uncertainties of financial markets. This paper examines the theoretical and practical dimensions of position sizing, highlighting its role in risk management and portfolio optimization. We also evaluate common position sizing methodologies and their implications for portfolio management."}}

Within the information component, market-wide information share increases perceived volatility and tail risks, while firm-specific information reduces both risks. Private firm-specific information plays a particularly important role in dampening perceived volatility and tail risk, while public information helps alleviate perceived left-tail risk, especially during crisis. These results highlight an unexplored aspect of rational pricing of risk in the SSO market, wherein market participants take into account the informational structure of underlying returns while pricing stock options."}}

This paper challenges that view by introducing a dual-risk valuation framework that extends DCF logic to assets with arbitrary monetization formats, including cryptocurrencies. The framework separates two structural primitives: a benchmark discount rate c, reflecting external opportunity cost, and a valuation distortion ratio K, capturing belief-based deviations from unbiased expectations. Their interaction yields an effective discount rate c_eff, which rationalizes investor-implied valuations while preserving structural consistency. We formalize this decomposition analytically, derive closed-form expressions for c_eff in terminal-value settings, and present a scalar approximation of fair value for multi-period cases with uniform expectations. This enables tractable valuation of cryptoassets such as Bitcoin, which lack income streams, and hybrid DeFi instruments that combine staking yields or synthetic cash flows with terminal resale value. The model also accommodates expectation heterogeneity and sentiment-driven mispricing by explicitly quantifying informational risk. By grounding DCF in structural opportunity cost and empirical expectation divergence, this approach dissolves the traditional dichotomy between productive and nonproductive assets. It provides a unified, interpretable, and empirically implementable valuation framework suitable for both traditional and blockchain-based assets."}}

This study reframes model selection as a strategic design choice shaped by two foundational trade-offs: the classical bias–variance trade-off from statistical learning and a benefit–penalty trade-off that links classification outcomes—true and false positives and negatives—to operational payoffs. We develop a theoretical framework in which firms estimate candidate expected quality using models that may be overspecified (including extraneous features) or underspecified (omitting relevant ones) relative to the ground-truth model. We show that overspecification can improve outcomes in moderately selective environments by amplifying quality dispersion and increasing true positives, while underspecification can reduce false positives and false negatives in high-selectivity settings by acting as a conservative filter. We further identify conditions under which a simpler or more complex model outperforms the other regardless of the ground-truth specification. Specifically, a simpler model is preferred when misclassification costs are high; a more complex model is preferred when the benefit of accurate identification of qualified candidates is high; and the correctly specified model is optimal when both misclassification costs and the benefit of accurate identification of qualified candidates are high. These findings overturn the classical presumption that correct specification is always optimal and demonstrate that model complexity should be treated as a context-sensitive design choice—one that links statistical estimation to operational payoff."}}

The test is based on equation-by-equation estimation, using a randomized version of the estimated alphas, which only requires rates of convergence. The distinct features of the proposed methodology are that it does not require the estimation of any covariance matrix, and that it allows for both N and T to pass to infinity, with the former possibly faster than the latter. Further, unlike extant approaches, the procedure can accommodate conditional heteroskedasticity, non-Gaussianity, and even strong cross-sectional dependence in the error terms. We also propose a de-randomized decision rule to choose in favor or against the correct specification of a linear factor pricing model. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test has satisfactory properties and it compares favorably to several existing tests. The usefulness of the testing procedure is illustrated through an application of linear factor pricing models to price the constituents of the S&amp;P 500."}}

Next came computers and the addition of statistical models such as logistic regression. Bureau data and internal data could now be used in a more rigorous framework where the weights of different consumer characteristics such as income, past loan default history, number of inquiries on checking accounts or loan products, tradeline details, or contact information were determined by statistical theory and not solely on opinions of how to weigh them in an expert opinion scorecard (known as EJM, expert judgement model). Increases in regulations such as Basel II and IFRS 9 have also driven the demand for credit modeling (Siddiqi 2-5). Finally, machine learning was slowly adapted through decision trees for fraud modeling with products such as Angoss and really took off with easy access to machine learning development through Python. Machine learning has been the main topic in retail credit modeling in 2025 however there are many parallels to modeling retail credit in waves and leaning on quantum theory for a deeper understanding on retail credit while enhancing model predictability leading to a market edge and more efficient credit markets for consumers. This approach is only becoming possible through more granular transaction level data from companies such as Finicity and Plaid. Consumers have also gotten used to sharing their private information as a way to make products cheaper such as insurance or to enhance their experience with social media platforms. This paper will explore some of the ideas behind modeling retail credit as wave functions and a loose parallel to quantum superposition. More research is needed from banks and financial institutions who have access to this sort of transaction level data.</span></p><span>This paper and the ideas behind it are not intended to claim or state that credit markets are driven by a hard science such as physics. The intent of the paper is to draw ideas from modeling methodologies from physics as a new way to approach retail credit problems. Financial markets and consumers are too complex for a simple closed form solution. The ideas and modeling within this paper will deviate from physics as there is no intention to stick to the rules and laws of physics.</span>"}}

We build on the idea that households' price hunting intensifies with surprise inflation. In our model, households observe only local monopolists' prices and must exert effort to see other sellers' prices to eventually buy from them. This friction leads households to doubt that local price changes are idiosyncratic, even when all prices change uniformly in response to a nominal aggregate shock. In such a case, households overestimate the benefits of exerting effort, reallocating more spending toward lower-markup sellers. We show that, through this channel, output can expand significantly with surprise inflation, despite flexible shop pricing and acyclical posted markups. Using U.S. retailer scanner data, we validate our model's distinctive prediction that inflation measured over paid prices moves more slowly than inflation measured over posted prices, both unconditionally and in response to monetary policy shocks."}}

The distribution of COH is highly concentrated, with the top 25 firms-mainly utilities and energy companies-accounting for over half of the total. Still, we find substantial variation within sectors, driven by differences in operational structure and emissions geography. Adjusting for carbon cost pass-through from upstream energy providers reallocates up to 70% of the COH away from regulated utilities and toward downstream customers. Importantly, even under the most ambitious policy scenario, we find that prevailing and anticipated carbon pricing mechanisms are expected to internalize only about half of the societal damages from corporate emissions. Overall, our framework underscores the importance of forward-looking and location-specific emissions and carbon price forecasts as essential inputs for integrating carbon risk into financial analysis and valuation."}}

The results indicate that increases in the SLR lead to a significant contraction in output in the medium run, alongside persistent inflationary pressures and a tightening of monetary and credit conditions. These effects are asymmetric: tightening actions produce strong and persistent macro-financial responses, while loosening actions yield muted effects. I identify two main transmission channels-portfolio reallocation on the asset side, with a shift from long-term to short-term lending, and adjustments in funding structure, including increased reliance on deposit mobilization and reduced use of money market borrowings. These findings provide fresh insights into the real effects of liquidity regulation, a dimension that remains relatively underexplored compared to its regulatory counterparts such as capital requirements."}}

By expressly reflecting upon whether and how a tax rule or tax regime affects people differently depending on their class, family structure, disability, race, gender, or sexual orientation, critical tax studies are instrumental in highlighting instances when these core tax policy principles are violated.

To mitigate this risk, MDBs have implemented Exposure Exchange Agreements (EEAs), a powerful tool for managing single name and geographical concentration. These bilateral agreements, first introduced in 2015, involve MDBs compensating each other in case of defaults on matched subsets of their portfolios. Initially, participating banks with identical credit ratings exchanged portfolios with matched Exposure at Default (EAD) and expected losses, disregarding counterparty risk.</p>\n<p>However, the landscape is evolving as MDBs explore EEAs with differently rated counterparties, ranging from AAA to AA-. This shift raises crucial questions about how varying counterparty credit qualities impact deal participants’ risks. The challenge lies in determining appropriate EAD scaling for lower-rated MDBs relative to higher-rated ones, considering the dual risk of borrower default and counterparty failure.</p>\n<p>To address this, a novel approach equalizes Expected Losses (EL) for both parties, accounting for counterparty risk. This method yields a simple closed-form equation for scaling factors, applicable in both provisioning and fair pricing approaches. The provisioning approach uses actual Probabilities of Default (PDs) and Loss Given Default (LGD) rates, while the fair pricing approach employs market-implied PDs.</p>\n<p>Analysis reveals that scaling factors vary significantly between approaches and are influenced by the Weighted Average Life (WAL) of the EEA. For a 12.5-year WAL EEA, fair pricing approach scaling factors range from 10% to 50%, while provisioning approach factors are much lower at 1% to 3%. These findings provide crucial guidance for MDBs in structuring EEAs with differently rated counterparties, enabling more effective risk management and portfolio diversification.</p>"}}

A referendum regarding the reinstatement of the monarchy is used as an indicator of political beliefs, and, in a difference-indifferences setting, it is demonstrated that 10% greater political opposition to the monarchy implied that female labour force participation was 1.4% higher after the war. A plausible mechanism is through conservative areas becoming more conservative and liberal areas becoming more liberal, and data on the construction of new churches, a conservative institution, are consistent with this hypothesis.

To this effect, Nigeria has severally experimented with democratic governments since independence. Past attempts were terminated by the military due to the failure of the politicians. But on May 29, 1999, the country successfully installed a democratically elected government.&nbsp; Since then, Nigeria has had an unbroken 13 years of democratic government to date.

The paper reveals that poverty is the major reason behind the failure of Nigerian democracy.

The chapter delves into key facets of Nigerian life—arts, festivals, clothing, cuisine, and social customs—highlighting their deep-rooted communal and symbolic significance. Traditional arts, including sculpture, mask-making, music, and dance, serve both aesthetic and spiritual purposes. Major festivals such as Eyo, Durbar, Ekpe, Ekpo, and the New Yam Festival underscore Nigeria’s vibrant celebratory culture and ancestral reverence. The chapter also examines Nigeria’s evolving marriage systems, burial rites, and religious practices, revealing a dynamic interplay between tradition, Islam, Christianity, and indigenous beliefs. It discusses how traditional values continue to influence marriage customs, inheritance, and gender roles despite the rise of modern civil and religious marriages. Architecture and cuisine reflect environmental adaptation and regional diversity, while Nigerian eating habits are deeply tied to social etiquette and communal values. Education and religion emerge as both unifying and divisive forces, with Western-style education contributing to modernization and independence movements, while religious pluralism has fueled social conflict. The roles of secret societies like Ekpe and Ekpo are analyzed in both cultural and political contexts.

Yet, by enabling senior workers to perform more tasks on their own, AI may inadvertently reduce entry-level opportunities, raising concerns about how future generations will acquire essential skills. This paper develops a model to examine how advanced automation affects the intergenerational transmission of tacit knowledge. The analysis reveals that automating entry-level tasks generates immediate productivity gains but may undermine long-term growth by eroding the skills of future generations. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that AI-driven automation of entry-level work could lower the long-run annual growth rate in the U.S. by approximately 0.05 to 0.35 percentage points, depending on the scale of automation. I further demonstrate that AI co-pilots---systems offering scalable access to sophisticated expertise previously gained only through direct experience---can partially mitigate these adverse effects. However, their introduction is not always beneficial, as co-pilots may inadvertently diminish younger workers' incentives to engage in hands-on learning. These findings challenge the optimistic view that AI will automatically sustain productivity growth, suggesting instead that to harness AI’s potential fully, it is crucial to safeguard or create new entry-level opportunities.</span>"}}

Beginning with the Dutch East India Company's establishment of Cape Town in 1652, European colonization disrupted indigenous societies, leading to conflicts, displacement, and the institutionalization of racial hierarchies. The British annexation of the Cape Colony in 1814 further entrenched colonial rule, fostering economic and political structures that marginalized black South Africans. The discovery of diamonds and gold in the 19th century accelerated white settlement and solidified segregationist policies, culminating in the formal implementation of apartheid in 1948 under Afrikaner nationalist rule. This system of racial segregation and oppression lasted until the first democratic elections in 1994, following decades of resistance and international pressure. The post-apartheid era has seen efforts toward reconciliation and transformation, but economic inequality and racial disparities persist as enduring remnants of colonialism. This paper examines apartheid as a colonial relic, analyzing its historical roots, economic implications, and social impact. It argues that the structural inequalities established during colonial rule continue to shape contemporary South African society, highlighting the need for sustained policy interventions to address the legacies of apartheid.</span>"}}

The chapter traces Angola's pre-colonial roots and the profound impact of Portuguese colonialism, particularly under the corporatist Salazar regime, highlighting how colonial policies shaped ethnic divisions and economic inequalities. The armed struggle for liberation, which began in 1961, is analyzed through the evolution and rivalries of the FNLA, MPLA, and UNITA, each rooted in different regional and ethnic bases. Post-independence, Angola embraced Marxist-Leninist one-party rule, marked by repression, internal purges, and the violent suppression of dissent, notably the 1977 Nitista crisis. The subsequent decades were defined by a protracted civil war fueled by Cold War dynamics and the competition for natural resources, especially oil and diamonds. Despite peace efforts and democratic transitions, the civil war only ended in 2002 following the death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. However, the exclave of Cabinda has continued to experience unrest. The chapter concludes that Angola’s post-colonial experience has been shaped by enduring legacies of colonialism, resource-driven conflict, and governance challenges, resulting in a fragile state marked by persistent inequality and contested national unity.</span>"}}

Historically speaking, Greece has repeatedly experienced periods of inflationary pressure. Over the past 50 years, global supply-side shocks have triggered cost-push inflation, which was often accommodated by expansionary policies. This paper analyses the historical trajectory of inflationary shocks in Greece, aiming to document inflation trends from the early 1970s to the present. In particular, it identifies the underlying forces that have driven inflation, which in turn entails an examination of both domestic demand and supply shocks, as well as global supply shocks. We find that there is a direct interplay between domestic demand and supply shocks, global supply shocks driven by geopolitical tensions and Greek headline inflation."}}

Using a mixed-method approach, it combined qualitative focus group discussions with a quantitative online survey to assess the perspectives and experiences of these groups. The findings are presented around five key issues perceived by the host community and refugees. These include safety, security, community relations, economic conditions, and the role of international organizations. It is argued that the evidence and analysis presented in this paper can help inform policy and practice by emphasizing the importance of understanding both the host and refugee experiences. This underscores the need for inclusive national planning to promote integration, social security, and protection of all individuals in Jordan. This research highlights how recognizing and addressing host community perspectives can enhance refugee integration and foster sustainable development amidst growing tension. By challenging misconceptions and valuing the needs of both Jordanians and refugees, this study advocates a cohesive and resilient society."}}

To study these changes, we use a large-scale overlapping generations model calibrated to the Spanish Economy, and show that this pension reform backfires. This is because these changes bring no significant variation to the sustainability problems that plague the Spanish public pension system. In addition, this pension reform hurts current and future high earners’ welfare, because the higher payroll taxes they have to pay. Thus, we conclude that further reforms are imminent in the near future of Spanish pensions. Policymakers should seriously consider overhauling the current Spanish public pension system and replacing it with a model that combines a sustainable contributory pay-as-you-go pensions with mandatory individual retirement accounts."}}

Both primary and secondary data were used for the analysis. The primary data were collected with the aid of focused group discussion field survey which covered six communities selected at random from the local government in 2020, with 30 farming households head selected from each community, totalling 180 farmers. The secondary data such as monthly rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature span the periods 1986-2020 and were sourced from Nigeria Meteorological Agency, while crop yield like cassava and yam were collected from Agricultural Development Programme Office Rivers State for the periods 1999 to 2020. The primary data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics techniques, while multiple regression techniques were employed in estimating the secondary data. The outcome of the study revealed that the mean annual rainfall of the area was 2235.9 mm, while the average temperature was 27.1°C. Annual maximum and minimum temperature were 31.4°C and 22.7°C respectively. The evidence shows that the rainfall and temperature over the duration decreases and increases respectively, and the shift in rainfall pattern that affected crop minimum and maximum temperatures were negatively correlated with crop production. Further inquiries also revealed that about 43.3 % and 68.5 % variation in cassava and yam respectively, were cuased jointly due to variation in monthly and annual rainfall, while about 4.5 % and 7.0 % variation in cassava and yam production respectively can be explained by variation in temperature. Hence, crop production required small amount and evenly distributed rainfall at early stage of its growth."}}

While instrument-free approaches such as the Gaussian copula control function (GCCF) have gained popularity, recent evidence shows that GCCF fails in the traditional omitted variable bias case, often producing more biased estimates than OLS. This paper proposes a novel instrument-free method tailored to this prevalent form of endogeneity. Building on minimal assumptions (the sum of omitted variables is normally distributed and affects the endogenous regressor additively, and the existence of non-normal exogenous noise in the endogenous regressor) our approach uses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to disentangle the unobserved normal confounder from the exogenous, non-normal variation in the regressor. The recovered confounder is then incorporated as a control function, enabling consistent estimation of causal effects without external instruments. We prove formal identification under the proposed data-generating process and demonstrate through simulations that the method delivers unbiased estimates bias.

The empirical analysis uses data from the Mexican ejidos, agricultural communities created after a land reform carried out in the early twentieth century, and exploit changes in property rights derived from a massive land certification program that started its implementation in the 90s. Results from a difference-in-differences model show that in municipalities with certified ejidos the amount of spending per capita in public investments increases in comparison to municipalities without certified ejidos. In line with this result, we show that the second Mexican land reform increased public goods provision in municipalities with a larger proportion of ejido land. We provide evidence that the resources needed to cover the additional expenses were obtained from sources of income that allowed discretionary spending and that could be influenced by mayors. Finally, we show that the increase in public spending is related to voter turnout, suggesting political gains from the spending decisions.</span>"}}

Together with the benchmark discount rate c, K defines the valuation environment, and their interaction gives rise to the gain of capital g = f (c, K), a forward-looking, structural measure of ex-ante alpha. Rather than treating alpha as an ex-post residual, the framework embeds it directly into valuation as a function of expectational distortion. We derive the effective cost of capital c eff as the internal rate that reconciles distorted expectations with fair value, and characterize its behavior across horizon length and market discounting. The theory yields closed-form conditions under which the equivalence between discounting and expected return fails, and generalizes DCF models to incorporate systematic distortions in cash flow expectations."}}

This exercise brings clarity to a long-standing question of whether using energy prices (an \"energy-only\" market design) vs. payments for capacity (a \"capacity market\" design) leads to greater longrun efficiency. I use the model to analyze PJM, the largest electricity system in the United States. I estimate that the upper-bound welfare advantage of a price instrument relative to a quantity instrument is modest at approximately $29 million per year (less than 0.2 percent of annual energy expenditures) under the assumption of constant marginal benefits from system reliability, but costs to consumers are approximately $666 million greater due to higher energy prices from lower capacity investment. I solve for the break-even slope of the marginal benefits curve-the incremental social benefit from increasing electricity system reliability-that favors use of a quantity mechanism. If marginal benefits decrease by at least $7 per unit of reliability improvement (defined as a megawatt hour reduction in expected unserved energy), then a quantity instrument is cost-benefit justified."}}

Using employeremployee matched data from Washington State and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design around the eligibility threshold for UI, we find that benefit receipt minimally delays re-employment but substantially improves labor market outcomes. UI increases cumulative hours worked by approximately 15 full-time weeks and earnings by $14,000 in the two years following job loss, representing 37 percent and 50 percent increases, respectively. These gains are driven by improved job quality, as recipients experience longer tenure and higher wages with their next employer. Effects are larger for workers living near public employment offices, suggesting that access to re-employment services enhances search productivity. Expanding UI access by lowering the eligibility threshold is much more cost-effective than raising benefit levels or extending potential duration, as workers benefit from more stable, higher-paying re-employment that partially offsets its cost."}}

Social data allows companies to predict and modify human behavior, producing economic value for themselves and wealth for their investors. Tax law systematically undertaxes this now-crucial form of economic value creation. This undertaxation exacerbates inequality and prevents governments from raising much-needed revenue. This Article makes two key contributions. First, it develops the first link between tax law scholarship and scholarship on informational capitalism to offer a descriptive account of how companies leverage social data to create economic value and how that value escapes taxation. It reveals how tax law's focus on taxing monetary income and its preferential treatment of capital is at odds with digital companies' distinctive business models, which privilege growth and accrual of social data over short-term profits. This Article thus identifies a fundamental incongruence between tax law's structure and digital business models that allows Big Tech companies like Amazon to escape taxation. It is a failure that corporate income tax reforms-the prevailing but insufficient subject of most current tax law debates-alone cannot solve. Instead, and second, this Article offers a comprehensive three-part approach to reform: (1) capital tax reforms to capture social data value creation that manifests as growth in company market value, (2) data taxes to capture the intrinsic economic value of social data at the company level, and (3) corporate income tax reforms to account for how digital companies turn social data into corporate money."}}

Rapid population growth seems a major cause of deforestation. There are other significant causes are discussed in the paper. There are devastating consequences of deforestation having colossal and existential impacts on environment as well as our economic affairs. The adverse environmental and economic impacts of deforestation are well perceived by the state authority and it has outlined programs of afforestation of new areas and reforestation of degraded forest lands. Loss of tree cover has potentially devastating environmental implications for predominantly poor segment of the country.

While most cost assessments rely on the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) at the production point, this approach does not account for the infrastructure and energy losses that occur downstream. To address this limitation, we introduce a five-part cost framework composed of LCOH, the Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS), Distribution (LCOD), Delivery (LCODel), and End Use (LCOEU). Using current technology assumptions and cost parameters drawn from recent European Commission, DOE, and academic data, we model a representative system in which green hydrogen is used in stationary PEM fuel cells operating at 60% efficiency. Results show that while LCOH is 5.00 USD/kg, inclusion of storage, transport, and final delivery increases the upstream cost to 10.50 USD/kg. When end-use efficiency is incorporated, the effective cost of usable hydrogen energy rises to 17.50 USD/kg. This more than threefold increase illustrates how infrastructure requirements and energy conversion losses dominate the economics of delivered hydrogen. The analysis underscores the inadequacy of using LCOH alone as a basis for investment, policy design, or system evaluation. Instead, full-chain modeling provides a more accurate and transparent framework for identifying cost drivers, evaluating trade-offs, and comparing hydrogen systems to alternative energy carriers. The methodology presented supports decision-making across energy, transportation, and industrial applications where hydrogen is expected to play a growing role in decarbonization."}}

This suggests that a oneunit increase in the inflation rate leads to a decrease in GDP growth by approximately 0.119173 units in the long run. Furthermore, the results showed a negative and statistically significant impact of internet usage on GDP growth, with a coefficient of-0.098994, indicating that increased internet penetration is associated with a reduction in GDP growth in Nigeria. Additionally, the analysis showed that the SME financing has a positive but not statistically significant impact on GDP growth, with a unit increase in SME financing leading to an increase in GDP growth by 0.904737 units. Based on these findings, the study makes the following recommendations: It is crucial for the Nigerian government to adopt robust anti-inflationary measures, including tightening monetary policy by increasing interest rates to curb excessive money supply and dampen inflationary pressures. The government should focus on improving digital literacy by integrating ICT skills into educational curricula and promoting digital skills training for all age groups. Additionally, that the government should consider creating more targeted financial support programs for SMEs, such as low-interest loans, grants, and venture capital funding."}}

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test and bounds cointegration were used to check the properties of the variables, while the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was applied for data analysis. The findings indicate that fiscal deficits have a positive but not statistically significant impact on Nigeria's economic growth; external borrowing also shows a positive, though not statistically significant, effect on economic growth; foreign exchange reserves have a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth; and domestic borrowing continues to have a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth. Based on these findings, the study recommends, among other things, that the government should focus on improving the efficiency of fiscal spending, ensuring that deficits are targeted towards sectors that will maximize economic returns such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare. It also suggests that external borrowing should be strategically directed towards projects that are likely to generate economic returns sufficient to cover the cost of debt servicing, thereby avoiding unsustainable debt levels."}}

The use of key cashless policy indicators, including Point of Sale (POS), online payments, mobile money transactions, and ATM usage, was employed. GDP was utilized to calculate economic growth. After the F-bound test confirmed a long-term link and found various degrees of integration between the variables, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model was used. All cashless transactions, including mobile money and online payments, showed a noteworthy long-term impact on economic performance, according to the ARDL data, while point-of-sale and automated teller machine transactions had a strong short-term impact on economic growth. Given these findings, it is suggested that mobile payment systems be optimized for economic growth by reducing transaction costs, increasing public awareness, and expanding mobile network coverage. Similarly, enhancing web-based financial services by improving infrastructure and usability can further amplify their positive effects on economic development.

This research critically investigates nature-based solutions (NbS) in strengthening climate resilience and disaster risk reduction (DRR) in Ethiopia. Based on a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, we evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of NbS interventions, including agroforestry, ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (eco-DRR), sustainable land management, and ecosystem restoration, in addressing interconnected environmental and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Our data indicate that NbS has multifunctional benefits, including both short-term risk reduction and long-term climate adaptation and mitigation outcomes. They also help to conserve biodiversity, improve livelihoods, and provide essential ecosystem services in rural and urban regions. However, NbS implementation in Ethiopia is hampered by weak institutional capability, fragmented policy frameworks, and insufficient funding mechanisms. To address these issues, the article suggests an integrated, multi-level governance strategy that encourages collaboration among local communities, policymakers, development practitioners, and researchers. We conclude that integrating NbS into national and subnational policies is critical to Ethiopia's egalitarian, sustainable, and climate-resilient development."}}

Yet, because there is limited empirical research directly comparing them, little is known about how differently trained practitioners (for example, accountants and lawyers) approach tax work. Employing mixed methods in a qualitatively driven manner, we first draw on in-depth interviews with 38 mostly senior-level practitioners. From these interviews, we inductively identify four dimensions—basic orientation, basic mindset, broader sensitivity, and process orientation—along which tax professionals are seen to differ, as well as an overall philosophy that appears to guide how they approach tax work. On the basis of these findings, we conduct a second study, an open-ended response survey, that allows us to refine and substantiate these dimensions and the philosophies identified. In a third study, we use a survey to quantitatively triangulate the dimensions and philosophies identified through our qualitative data, and to delve more deeply into the extent to which practitioners may evolve and whether there is any convergence in the approaches of differently trained professionals over time. Our three studies contribute to a growing body of literature examining tax professionals and their work by advancing the understanding of how individuals typically differ in their overall approaches to tax work, by offering insight into the comparative growth in competence, and by offering a possible explanation for why some groups of professionals may be more actively involved than others in tax planning. Our findings have implications for professional associations and others who oversee the competence and quality of work of tax practitioners, as well as educational institutions and others who are charged with their training."}}

The dependent variable in the study is the GDP growth rate (annual %), while the independent variables include investment in roads and construction, access to electricity (% of population), investment in transport and communication, and fixed telephone subscriptions (per 100 people). The data analysis techniques utilized include the ADF unit root test, bounds cointegration, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) estimation method and the residual diagnostic tests. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root tests revealed a mix of I(1) and I(0) series, indicating that the variables differ in their levels of integration. Evidence of cointegration was established, suggesting a long-term equilibrium relationship among the variables. The ARDL results revealed that investment in roads and construction exhibits a negative relationship with economic growth, which is not statistically significant; access to electricity has a positive relationship but is not statistically significant with economic growth; investment in transport and communication has a positive and statistically significant impact on Nigeria's economic growth; and fixed telephone subscriptions have a positive but not statistically significant impact on economic growth in Nigeria. Based on these findings, the study recommends, among other things, that the Nigerian government should conduct a thorough review of the current strategies and allocations in road construction.

This paper considers the situations under which both the factors and factor loadings can be estimated without rotations asymptotically. Asymptotic distributions of the proposed estimators are derived. Theoretical findings are supported by simulations.

In other words, we examine whether behaviors such as extortion, when unpunishable and unmonitorable, are perceived as more socially appropriate. Using a neutrally framed harassment bribery game experiment, we manipulate the presence of a third-party punisher alongside with a Krupka-Weber norm-elicitation procedure to analyze shifts in participants' normative perceptions.

While a weak consensus emerges regarding the inappropriateness of extortion behavior, substantial disagreement persists concerning the merits of punishing extortionists.

When considering the connection between taxation and the rule of law, it is helpful to distinguish between two aspects of the rule of law. The narrow-scope rule of law concerns whether disputes are decided according to legal norms that are general, prospective and impartial. The widescope rule of law concerns whether the government rules through law or through some extra-legal method and whether the government respects existing legal entitlements. Although closely connected, the two aspects of the rule of law are distinct: a violation of the rule of law in one sense does not necessarily have significant implications for the aspect of the rule of law. Tax disputes implicate both aspects of the rule of law. Tax adjudication violates narrow-scope rule of law when it ignores established law, appeals to legal norms that are not known in advance or renders judgments on grounds of personal partiality. Taxation violates wide-scope rule of law when used to expropriate politically unfavoured parties, confer benefits on politically favoured parties, or regularly shift tax burdens in arbitrary and unpredictable ways. This understanding of the rule of law does not yield any straightforward argument in favour of more formal methodologies of statutory interpretation or against anti-abuse rules. If the applicable legal norms are known in advance, it is not a violation of the narrow-scope rule of law to decide cases according to principles rather than rules or economic substance rather than legal form. Less formal, more purposive forms of adjudication tend to rely more on sound judgment by judges. In a legal system with a skilled and impartial judiciary, anti-abuse rules are not inherently threatening to the rule of law. They are less desirable in polities with wide-scope rule of law deficits. When tax disputes are highly politicised and the impartiality of the tax authorities and judiciary is open to question, it may be preferable to adopt more formal methods of adjudication that rely less on abstract reasoning about tax policy and that are easier to monitor for signs of bias. Tax law methodology should be calibrated to political context. Approaches that might be best suited for politically stable polities with highly skilled impartial judiciaries might be ill-suited for other contexts."}}

We find that households' access to grid electricity positively correlates with the likelihood of males participating in non-farm work and females participating in agriculture. In electrified households, females reallocate time from domestic work and caregiving to more leisure and farming. Household access to electricity is positively associated with increased ownership of appliances such as fans, refrigerators, televisions, and mobile phones, as well as greater use of electric pumps for irrigation. Electrification is also linked to higher employment of female household members in farm operations and greater involvement in decision-making related to agricultural activities and household expenditures. These findings suggest that in farming communities, agriculture may play a critical role in the linkages between rural household electrification, women's workforce participation, and household bargaining power."}}

A high level of digitalization could alleviate the negative impacts of “social distance”, but a high level of information asymmetry would exacerbate the shocks from the epidemic prevention measures, suggesting that the corporate governance channel drives the results. Alternative mechanisms, such as direct exposure to the pandemic or location diversification, are not the key cause for the results.

Channel tests reveal that this effect is primarily driven by increased ESG disagreement among rating agencies, greater environmental expenditures, and elevated litigation risks. Cross-sectional analyses further suggest that the influence of these regulations on loan spreads is more pronounced for firms with higher information opacity, greater financial constraints, and those operating in countries with weaker legal enforcement.

The reliability however has a moderate effect on satisfaction of the customer to use the modern banking services. Providing the accurate and promised services at all time of transaction is more valuable to the customers. They demand the quality services as modern banking service provider claim. The customer is preferred that the bank staff will be responsive enough to provide accurately and consistent services and on time.

The modern banking service should focus on the on time delivery of their promised services along with quality and having a good relation with customer by providing accurate information with responsibility and according to the need of the customer as it will prove benefited for the service provider in the long run and retain valued customer. As the quality of the services provided by the modern banking improve continuously the customer satisfaction increases towards modern banking. The overall study shows that the customers are willing to use the modern services like the online banking, ATM etc. they prefer the facility provided by the modern banking but some factors like Responsiveness and reliability have effect their level of satisfaction.

While most of the existing literature focused on human-machine interactions with algorithmic systems in advisory roles, research on human behavior in monitoring or verification processes that are conducted by automated systems remains largely absent. This is surprising given the growing implementation of algorithmic systems in institutions, particularly in tax enforcement and financial regulation, to help monitor and detect misreports, or in online labor platforms widely implementing algorithmic control to ensure that workers deliver high service quality. Our study examines how human dishonesty changes when detection of untrue statements is performed by machines versus humans, and how ambiguity in the verification process influences dishonest behavior. We design an incentivized laboratory experiment using a modified die-roll paradigm where participants privately observe a random draw and report the result, with higher reported numbers yielding greater monetary rewards. A probabilistic verification process introduces risk of detection and punishment, with treatments varying by verification entity (human vs. machine) and degree of ambiguity in the verification process (transparent vs. ambiguous). Our results show that under transparent verification rules, cheating magnitude does not significantly differ between human and machine auditors. However, under ambiguous conditions, cheating magnitude is significantly higher when machines verify participants' reports, reducing the prevalence of partial cheating while leading to behavioral polarization manifested as either complete honesty or maximal overreporting. The same applies when comparing reports to a machine entity under ambiguous and transparent verification rules. These findings emphasize the behavioral implications of algorithmic opacity in verification contexts. While machines can serve as effective and cost-efficient auditors under transparent conditions, their black box nature combined with ambiguous verification processes may unintentionally incentivize more severe dishonesty. These insights have practical implications for designing automated oversight systems in tax audits, compliance, and workplace monitoring."}}

Prior empirical studies that use historical option price data from the late 19th century find that option prices did not deviate significantly from modern pricing patterns. This finding implies that traders in early markets had a sophisticated understanding of option mechanics, despite the lack of a formal mathematical model. To further explore this intriguing finding, I examine option trading manuals and academic papers published in the late 19th century to assess the prevailing understanding of option pricing during that period. The analysis of these sources reveals that market practitioners regarded options as instruments sensitive to market fluctuations and approached the complex problem of option pricing through sophisticated techniques that resemble those employed by modern option traders. This likely explains the observed empirical similarities between historical and contemporary option prices."}}

This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by examining the experiences of layer farmers in coping with both disasters and identifying the factors that contribute to their resilience. This study used a grounded theory approach with layer farmers with a minimum of 10 years of farming experience to understand the challenges faced by farmers during both disasters. Interview data and field notes were analyzed through three stages of coding–open, axial, and selective coding–using NVivo 15 software. Survival and adaptation strategies are resilience capacities that emerge in the face of such disasters. These strategies include personal funding sources, social values and operational flexibility. The attributes that can improve the resilience capacity of layer farmers are agricultural diversification, financial planning skills, social relationships, and business scale. Understanding the resilience of layer farms in the face of disasters is critical for realizing more disaster-resilient farm businesses and ensuring the sustainability of poultry farming, particularly small-scale farming. The resilience assessment is expected to prepare poultry farmers for future disasters."}}

Across case studies in the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, and China, CHPMAR retrofits deliver measurable gains: 13% hydroelectric recovery at Hoover Dam, 18.7% reduction in Colorado River overdraw, 27–34% improved hydration efficacy, and multi‑species ecological rebound in compliance with the Endangered Species Act.

To address this, we develop a model in which regimes choose both whether to repress and whether to conceal repression. We leverage equilibrium relationships to propose a method for recovering concealed repression using observable data. We then provide an informational theory of deterrence and backlash effects, identifying the conditions under which each arises and intensifies. Finally, we show that comparing protest probabilities in the presence and absence of repression provides an upper bound on the size of the backlash effect, overstating its magnitude and thereby underestimating the efficacy of repression."}}

Predictive analyticspowered by machine learning (ML) algorithms-has emerged as a transformative tool in strategic planning, enabling businesses to extract actionable insights from vast and complex datasets. This paper explores how predictive analytics, integrated with machine learning techniques, is reshaping business strategy across industries. Drawing on recent empirical studies, case analyses, and technological developments, the research investigates key applications such as customer behavior modeling, demand forecasting, risk assessment, and operational optimization. The paper begins by establishing a theoretical framework that connects predictive analytics with strategic decision-making models. It then examines core machine learning methodologies-such as regression analysis, decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble models-that underpin predictive systems. Through cross-industry case studies, the research illustrates how organizations have effectively applied ML-driven analytics to gain foresight, improve agility, and outperform competitors in areas like finance, retail, and supply chain management. The study also addresses organizational and technological challenges, including data quality, algorithmic bias, skill gaps, and ethical considerations. A synthesis of findings reveals that the successful deployment of predictive analytics is not solely reliant on technology, but also on organizational readiness, leadership commitment, and a data-driven culture. By bridging technical innovation with strategic execution, this paper contributes to the understanding of predictive analytics as a key enabler of sustainable competitive advantage. It concludes with practical recommendations for business leaders seeking to embed predictive capabilities into their strategic frameworks, highlighting the evolving role of machine learning in shaping future-ready enterprises."}}

This study investigates the evolving trends in ESG investing within emerging markets through the lens of behavioral finance, emphasizing how cognitive biases, investor psychology, and socio-cultural factors shape investment decisions. Drawing on empirical data, case studies, and recent ESG index performances, the research analyzes the behavioral drivers that influence ESG investment flows in regions such as Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Key behavioral constructsincluding herding behavior, loss aversion, overconfidence, and social norm adherence-are examined to understand how they affect ESG fund selection, risk perception, and portfolio rebalancing among retail and institutional investors. The study also explores how regulatory frameworks, media narratives, and digital platforms contribute to shaping ESG awareness and sentiment in these markets. It highlights notable disparities in ESG data availability, corporate transparency, and investor education that continue to pose challenges for ESG integration. Findings suggest that while ESG investing in emerging markets is rising, it is often driven by reactive behaviors rather than long-term sustainable convictions. Moreover, cultural and regional nuances play a significant role in defining what constitutes \"ESG\" in local contexts. By combining behavioral finance theory with ESG investment analytics, this paper provides nuanced insights for policymakers, asset managers, and educators seeking to enhance ESG adoption responsibly. Ultimately, the study underscores the importance of behavioral awareness, data integrity, and tailored communication strategies in bridging ESG investing with sustainable development in emerging economies."}}

Consumers may initially hesitate to purchase an EV; however, if they observe more EVs in their neighborhood, on the road, or in parking lots, their reluctance to buy one may be alleviated. I build a system of equations to identify peer effects from lagged cumulative EV adoption by area and subgroups of type and brand values, with other effects from charging stations and socio-economic controls. This paper provides evidence that peer effects from the cumulative adoption of a specific model play a substantial role in the new adoption of the same model. While peer effects also increase overall adoption within the same ZCTA, competing types or brand values negatively affect the adoption of new EVs. I discuss the implications of these findings and how they affect the real impact of subsidization with peer effects. This paper also finds that the impact of subsidization would be significantly larger when peer effects are considered."}}

This paper develops an incomplete market dynamic general equilibrium model with an islands structure, where both idiosyncratic and islandlevel shocks affect firm productivity. In the model, households can hold three assets: (i) risky equity shares of individual firms; (ii) mutual fund shares, diversified bundles of these equities that hedge idiosyncratic but not island-level risk; and (iii) risk-free bonds. By incorporating declining transaction costs on mutual funds and personal and corporate income tax rates calibrated from data, this model can quantitatively explain these phenomena."}}

The presence of negative externalities and strategic behavior have made game theory a natural paradigm to design an international environmental agreement (IEA) that codifies what countries should do. Considering that countries are sovereign and no supranational entity can impose an agreement, a stream of literature adopted a noncooperative mode of play to the formation of an environmental coalition. On the other hand, as joint optimization of all countries’ payoff leads to the best outcome, cooperative games approach has also been proposed to share the cost of climate change.In this paper, we propose a model of coalition formation that combines both cooperative and noncooperative modes of play. Starting from any given coalition, we implement a Markov process that shows sequentially which countries join or leave the coalition until reaching an absorbing state. All possible sequential scenarios are considered and an allocation to the player is made taking into account individual rationality. An illustration with vulnerable and invulnerable countries to pollution is given."}}

We first show that if the player of a certain level avoids a contest, then any stronger player avoids it, and they avoid any contest with a still smaller prize as well. We then establish a sufficient and necessary condition for any possible boundary equilibrium to exist, and characterize the equilibrium participation and effort profiles. Among all the contests she possibly participates in, the top-level player assigns a greater probability to, and bids more aggressively in, a contest with a larger prize. Any nontop-level player behaves differently in the contests in each of which he is not necessarily a strongest contestant versus in those wherein he is certainly among the strongest. He is less (more) likely to participate in a contest with a larger prize within the former (latter) category, and bids with equal intensity across contests within the former but bids more aggressively in a contest with a larger prize within the latter. The social welfare at any equilibrium is entirely determined by the set of the contests that the bottom-level player possibly enters. In the interior equilibrium (everyone participates in each contest with strictly positive probability), all non-top-level players uniformly choose the same participation profile and the player of any such level bids equally aggressively across all contests."}}

Microfinance and FDI are two variables envisaged by the ILO to contribute to creation of decent work, especially in developing countries. Against this backdrop, this study examines the effects of microfinance and FDI on decent work in Nigeria, while controlling for the effects of commercial banks’ loans and advances and inclusive growth. In doing this, macro-level annual time series data covering the 1992-2022 period are analysed using various robust least squares (RLS) estimation techniques including the M-Estimation, S-Estimation and the MM-Estimation. The empirical evidence reveals negative and significant effects of microfinance banks’ loans and advances (MFBLA) on decent work, questioning the quality of work it may have contributed to proliferating. This suggests that at macro level, it may have contributed to the creation of more vulnerable employment, thus reducing the proportion of decent work in total employment in the country. FDI, commercial banks’ lending operations and inclusive growth are found to have been significant contributors to the creation of decent work in the country. These results are buttressed by evidence from the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) estimation. Based on the evidence, it is recommended that the nation’s financial sector be strengthened, and the lending institutions should make enterprise formalization and profitability important criteria for lending. It is also recommended that the government prioritises enhancing the attractiveness of the economy to foreign investment, while pursuing inclusive economic growth.</span>"}}

We derive the optimal portfolio selection rule implied by a loss function that accounts for different types of misclassification errors in portfolio construction. This approach leads to a return classification problem and the optimal rule buys or sells stocks based on their probabilities of being winners or losers, conditional on the stock characteristics. When returns are generated by an additive regression model and misclassification costs satisfy a symmetry condition, the optimal rule simplifies to the conventional sorting procedure based on expected returns. An empirical application using U.S. stock data shows that portfolios constructed using the optimal rule achieve higher Sharpe ratios compared to those built using conventional methods. Our results demonstrate that predictive signals in the cross-section of stock returns go beyond expected returns, and that properly optimized portfolio selection rules based on these signals can generate substantial economic value for investors."}}

Utilizing a dual methodological approach-a calibrated Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model and a Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression (BSVAR)-we identify a transmission mechanism where heightened uncertainty sentiment depreciates the parallel (digital) BOB/USDT exchange rate, amplifying inflationary pressures. Empirical impulse-response functions from daily data (January 2023 to April 2025) corroborate the model's predictions, showing significant and persistent inflation effects driven by sentiment shocks. Moreover, our findings underscore the stabilizing potential of monetary policy, even within Bolivia's constrained interest rate framework. This study offers critical insights for policymakers managing digital currency markets, emphasizing the need for real-time sentiment monitoring and proactive liquidity interventions to mitigate inflation risks."}}

A 25 basis point increase in the 30-year fixed rate mortgage raises real (nominal) rents by 1.7 (1.4) percent 12-24 months following the monetary policy shock. The effect is driven by a shift in household demand from the owner-occupied market to the rental market.

Analyzing electoral and administrative data from Hungary, we observe that following the 2011 expansion of voting rights to diaspora populations, northeastern border settlements experienced significant increases in voter registrations without corresponding population growth. Employing a difference-indifferences design, we attribute these increases to mayors fraudulently registering diaspora voters. Utilities data corroborate the absence of actual migration, and electoral outcomes remained unaffected. Consistent with our theory, municipalities implicated in fraud received increased central government funding, and mayors allocated more procurement contracts to firms affiliated with the regime.

This lack of evidence makes it difficult to communicate the economic and employment-based benefits of the NTE to decision-makers.

Most academics researched Uttarapatha and Dakshinapatha, but no research was done on the Rājagṛiha to Tāmraliptī trade route, which was the primary city of Buddhism and to the principal trading port in east India. this route was the historical marine and land trading routes along India's east coast. It is proven by the chronicles, jātakas, and archaeological findings which detail the interrelationship had with Buddhist monasteries and commerce guilds (Shreni). This trade route was more accurate in international trade as well as cultural exchanges during and as well as after the period of king Ashoka (3rd century BCE).

Factor selection, spanning tests, and cross-sectional regressions confirm the robust pricing power of these new factors.

I demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting a Lalonde-style replication of findings from a land tenure RCT in Benin. The satellite double machine learning (S-DML) method recovers RCT treatment effects across multiple outcomes where traditional observational approaches fail. This approach offers several advantages: it leverages free satellite data, provides a computationally efficient way to process imagery, and enables evaluation of historical interventions. The S-DML method has broad potential applications in evaluating environmental policy, conflict, economic growth, and other spatial treatments where confounders may appear in satellite imagery."}}

Among money rules, we see that a flexible money growth rule generates the highest welfare. This is followed by the Taylor rule with money and then the constant money growth rule. These results are robust to changes in model parameters. Next, we look at the impact of key monetary parameters on the welfare gains. We find that a low currency to deposit ratio, elasticity of substitution, reserves to money supply ratio, ratio of banking activities, and money supply to nominal consumption ratio are associated with higher welfare gains. Furthermore, the gains of using money rules are higher under monetary shocks as opposed to real shocks."}}

As a matter of fact, being a small state of Indian sub-continent. Tripura has a mixed population of tribals and non-tribals. Of the farmer, the Tripuris, the Reangs, the Jamatias, the Chakmas, the Helams, the Noatias and the Mogs are important. The non-tribal population consists mostly of Bengalees. A meeting point of two different ways of life - a point where two cultures meet without loss of indentity and individuality - is not only quite possible, but seems the only possible way towards what many of us call ‘ integration’. This paper also explains the term ‘ethnic integration’ in a broader sense. Actually, this is a kind of situation in which the tribals can retain their languages, myths, religion and social customs, while at the same time allowing themselves to a process of change in these matters. The initial contributors to this composite culture we are talking about are the early inhabitants of the land, whose origin may be traced to Indo-Mongloid blood and the people of surrounding areas- the Bengales. Next came the Muslims, the Manipuris and the Buddhists. This paper justifies the reason for the problems and challenges pertaining to ethnic integration. In Tripura, altogether there are 19 tribes having different linguistic backgrounds, cultural dimensions, economic status and over-all social condition. But as a whole, it is observed that some tribal language and dialects are ignored. Whenever we talk, we overlook their present condition and altogether we underestimate their existence .To provide equal opportunities the correct positive approach is needed, only then their condition can be upgraded.\n </div>\n</div>"}}

In the ongoing multilateral efforts to reform international taxation to better accord with the challenges imposed by digitalisation and globalisation, the EU has taken in very active role. In the end of 2022, this has resulted in the adoption of the Minimum Tax Directive (2022/2325), which obliges EU Member States to implement the soft-law compromise achieved at the level of the OECD and the Inclusive Framework on Global Anti-Base Erosion (GLoBE) Model Rules. Particularly against the background of the EU's traditional reluctance to become active in this area, the author aims to contextualise this remarkable policy step in EU economic policy. The author demonstrates that implementing minimum taxation rules in the form of a legally binding and enforceable directive is, in principle, the proper thing to do in a setting characterised by heterogeneous interests of states and high tax competitive pressures. However, the institutional framework governing the implementation of the directive and its future development is not viable. Unanimous decision-making in the Council under Article 115 TFEU risks locking Member States into a specific version of an international soft law compromise, which continues to evolve outside the EU, without any guarantee that Member States will maintain consistent positions in this context. This reinforces the need for a serious debate on the adequacy of Article 115 TFEU as a legal basis for direct tax harmonisation. 1 | AN OUTDATED INTERNATIONAL TAX REGIME IN A CONTEXT OF GROWING MULTILATERALISM 1.1 | What are the challenges in international taxation?

Gazzani and Guyon (2025) marked a relevant contribution by learning the VIX as a random variable, i.e., a measurable function of the model parameters and the Markovian factors. A neural network replaces the inner simulation and makes the joint calibration problem accessible. However, the minimization loop remains slow due to expensive outer simulation. The present paper overcomes this limitation by learning SPX implied volatilities, VIX futures, and VIX call option prices. The pricing functions reduce to simple matrix-vector products that can be evaluated on the fly, shrinking calibration times to just a few seconds."}}

A formula relating the flow-demand elasticity, the elasticity of speed with respect to density and the elasticity of density with respect to highway capacity identifies which hypercongested equilibria are paradoxical. The paradoxes hold except when flow-demand is elastic enough. The paradoxes arise because the fundamental theory of traffic flow ignores that more flow-demand, given the highway's capacity, increases the mass of cars, and the density of traffic; or that more capacity given the flow-demand, decreases traffic density.

Meta-analyses indicate that burnout is associated with adverse consequences for performance. However, a major limitation of the current literature is that it is exclusively correlational. In this study, we conduct a laboratory experiment to acquire the first causal evidence regarding the effect of burnout on performance. We study the performance of students on a standardized test. In one treatment, burnout is induced with a recall task, and in a control treatment the burnout is not induced. The data show that inducing burnout improves performance on the test. The results suggest that the negative correlation between burnout and performance, which we also observe in our study, is driven by the effect of poor performance on feelings of burnout. The pattern of results leads to a conjecture that feelings of burnout are a reaction that serves to partially offset poor performance."}}

It evaluates the geopolitical aspect benefits versus the challenges of integrating Sri Lanka within the world's most significant free trade agreement (RCEP). Although the economic aspects of Sri Lanka joining the RCEP are analysed, the geopolitical implications and aspects are yet to be uncovered. Therefore, this research paper investigates the geopolitical implications of Sri Lanka joining the RCEP and how it will continue to do so, especially analysing the impact of relations with member states, especially after India had opted out of participating in the RCEP partnership. Therefore, this study addresses the possible benefits and challenges that strengthen Sri Lanka's geopolitical aspect by joining a trade bloc by drawing on the context of relations with countries across the Asia-Pacific, the concept of geopolitical factors, and the geopolitical significance of the RCEP. In this qualitative research, data collection was conducted among experts in relevant fields sampled as representatives of government and nongovernment institutions. The themes were explored in depth using secondary data. Interview-based qualitative data were analysed and presented through thematic analysis, followed by themes that illustrate the aspects of geopolitics. The findings of this research will contribute to the understanding of how small nations such as Sri Lanka can use regional economic partnerships to enhance their geopolitical aspects and navigate complex international relations in an increasingly interconnected world."}}

Number of small children and the presence of spouse are found to robustly satisfy all instrumental variable criteria for the number-ofweeks-worked variable. The instrumental-variable-quantile-regression technique is used to analyze the income disparity across the quantiles of conditional income distribution while controlling for endogeneity. I find that the racial disparity is stronger when the endogeneity of labor market participation is acknowledged and also that the disparity gets larger at the upper quantiles of income conditioned on the individual attributes."}}

The employees exploit child workers by forcing them to work in subhuman conditions with long working hours and extremely low pay. While the Government of India reports about 17.36 million child labourers, other non-governmental organizations estimate the figure at much higher level of 44 million.!

The spread of outcome of return from the asset is called volatility which influences numerous financial decisions. The main goal of estimating the volatility is to assess the market risk. Volatility is one of the key parameters for pricing financial derivatives. Estimation of volatility helps in risk management and it also helps in efficient management of portfolios. In the present study, asymmetric nature of volatility is modeled by applying two popularly used asymmetric GARCH models i.e., GJR-GARH model and PGARCH model. BSE-Sensex is used as a proxy for Indian stock market and period of study is from 1st july, 1997 to 30th march,2013. Results of Augmented Dickey Fuller test reveals that the natural logarithmic values of Sensex returns and S&amp;P 500 returns are stationary at their level form. Results of analysis with selected asymmetric GARCH models reveals the presence of leverage effect in Indian stock market and it also confirms the effect of periodic cycles on the conditional volatility in the market. In order to test whether the selected asymmetric GARCH models adequately captured the persistence in volatility and to test whether residuals from the selected models are free from ARCH effect, ARCH LM test is conducted. Results of ARCH-LM test concludes that there is no ARCH effect left in residuals obtained from both GJR-GARCH Model and PGARCH Model estimations."}}

We examine whether these policies also motivate firms to increase investment in R&amp;D. We find a positive relationship between RPSs and R&amp;D investment, but primarily among firms with previous experience generating renewable electricity. Notably, electric utility firms focus their investments on external R&amp;D rather than on internal R&amp;D projects.

The answer to this question requires teasing apart the dual mechanisms at work shaping the relationship between WFH and pay—a selection-induced wage penalty and a treatment-based wage premium. Using longitudinal data from the U.S. Survey of Income and Program Participation (2019–2022), we disentangle these mechanisms using the COVID-19 Pandemic as a quasi-exogenous shock that disrupted voluntary WFH adoption, thereby reducing the confounding of voluntary selection into WFH and the selection mechanism. Our data show that the post-Pandemic period witnessed a stronger treatment-based wage premium for women, as they experienced 6.8% wage gain when shifting work arrangement from non-WFH to WFH, while no similar wage gain is observed for men. We further explore heterogeneity in these effects by examining family constraints and job characteristics. Women without caregiving burdens or those in socially oriented, contact-intensive jobs benefit most from WFH, suggesting that remote work can buffer against gendered workplace biases. However, for women with high family responsibilities, the selection-based wage penalty can offset any beneficial mechanism associated with WFH. Our findings highlight that WFH’s impact on gender wage difference is context dependent. Whether WFH can improve women’s pay depends on who adopts remote work, why, and in what kind of job. These insights contribute to literature on labor inequality, work arrangements, and organizational policy, emphasizing the need for nuanced approaches to workplace flexibility that address both the structural and individual-level factors shaping gendered outcomes.</p>"}}

Legally, companies can consider a wide range of stakeholder interests when deciding what is in the best interests of the company. Generally, most companies continue to pursue the shareholder primacy norm by seeking to maximise shareholder value. However, corporate Australia's support for the Voice to Parliament (and before that, the plebiscite on marriage equality) departed from the shareholder primacy norm in lending its support to these causes through CSR activities. Missing from this discussion is the voice of shareholders. A survey of 236 Australians suggests that most investors would prefer companies 'stick to their knitting' and maximise profits. Where investors were willing to forgo some profit, the amounts are low. Yet, perversely, these investors hold prosocial attitudes in their consumer and donor decisions."}}

The relevance of the study is stipulated by the need for legal support of military operations, compliance with international humanitarian law and protection of the rights of servicemen in the combat zone. The purpose of the article is to identify the key features of the activities of lawyers of military authorities and to develop the ways to improve the efficiency of their work in the combat zone. To achieve this goal, the study solved a number of tasks: the author characterizes the functional duties of lawyers of military command and control bodies; analyzes the regulatory and legal framework for their activities; identifies the peculiarities of performing the duties of lawyers of military command and control bodies in the combat zone; and offers recommendations for improving the efficiency of their activities. In the course of the study, the author used the methods of analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction and comparative legal method. Based on the results of the study, it is established that the effective activity of lawyers of military command and control bodies is critical for ensuring law and order, legality of military operations and protection of the rights of servicemen. At the same time, it has certain peculiarities that affect their work. Such features include: prompt response to changes in legislation, lack of access to adequate resources, increased responsibility in decision-making, confidentiality and preservation of military secrets, performance of duties in extreme conditions and speed of decisionmaking, adherence to military discipline and subordination to command. To improve the efficiency of lawyers' work, the author proposes a set of measures, including regular education and training, strengthening of cybersecurity measures, and improvement of interagency coordination. The practical significance of the study lies in the possibility of using its results to improve the legal support for the activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and to increase the efficiency of lawyers of military command and control bodies in combat conditions."}}

Central to the analysis is the question of whether the duty to state reasons itself should be redefined and impose stricter reasoning requirements on judges using AI, requiring them to articulate both 'pragmatic' and technical explanations of the systems' role in their decisions. While this approach may enhance the duty's normative goals of legitimacy, transparency and accountability, the paper also considers the potential drawbacks of imposing such a more robust reasoning obligation in AI-assisted judicial processes."}}

In this paper, we develop a model to examine the real effects of such cost reductions on corporate investment levels and their welfare implications for capital market participants. We show that corporate investment follows an inverted U-shaped pattern with respect to processing costs. This non-monotonic relation follows from two opposing forces. On one hand, lower processing costs improve price informativeness, which reduces agency frictions and increases entrepreneurs' financing capacity. On the other hand, they increase speculators' trading profits in the secondary market at the expense of initial investors, forcing entrepreneurs to compensate initial investors for future losses and reducing their financing capacity. Moreover, since trading profits are merely transfers among market participants rather than net gains, lowering processing costs does not necessarily benefit entrepreneurs or investors, nor does it always enhance overall welfare."}}

The study also highlights that personal curiosity and peer discussion are the most influential factors. Consumers perceive GST to bring uniformity and transparency but also direct concern of price increases and lack of clarity. This study highlights the need for awareness campaigns, programs, educational initiatives, and government communication to bridge the gap between GST and consumer understanding.

Using inflation perceptions in Germany as a case study, we provide empirical evidence that preferences on media consumption reinforce extreme political views and support for radical parties, more concretely towards the right. Additionally, we document a backfire effect, where exposure to contradictory information deepens ideological entrenchment. Our findings highlight the critical role of fragmented media landscapes and biased news consumption in shaping political attitudes and electoral behavior."}}

We also argue that these large profits could not have been realized without a low rate policy combined with heavy regulations on domestic financial institutions.

Ultimately, the profits earned by the central bank are, in effect, an implicit tax revenue levied on domestic depositors."}}

Our model-consistent exchange market pressure index is derived using a small open economy with rational expectations where we adopt a general, model-independent definition of exchange market pressure and follow two-step methodology proposed in Weymark (1995, 1998). We undertake counter-factual experiments to measure and evaluate exchange market pressure index for Turkish economy over the periods of 2005 to 2015. We show that exchange market pressure is inversely related to the proportion of banks utilizing the ROM facility, the size of Reserve Options Ratio, and Reserve Options Coefficients. We provide empirical evidence that exchange market pressure is significantly reduced both in size and volatility terms during the period while the Reserve Options Mechanism is in operation. Under Reserve Options Mechanism commercial banks are allowed to keep a certain percentage of their Turkish Lira reserve requirements in USD, Euro, and/or gold. Reserve Options Mechanism consists of two principal elements: reserve option ratio (ROR) and reserve option coefficients (ROCs) which are both set by the central bank. The upper limit for the proportion of domestic currency required reserves that is allowed to be held in foreign currency (FX) and gold is governed by reserve option ratio (ROR). The amount of FX and gold that can be held against per domestic currency required reserves is called the reserve option coefficient (ROC)."}}

This raises some critical questions: Why, despite persistent strikes and protests, have workers failed to secure substantial political change? And, what is to be done to build worker power in Iran? \n<br>\n<br>\n To answer these questions, I will trace the history of labour organising in Iran since the 1979 revolution, with a focus on the resurgence of labour activism since 2010.

Regression analysis, descriptive statistics, residual statistics, Collinearity Diagnostics and Durbin-Watson were the techniques used to analyze data and examine the relationship between the two major variables of the study. The yearly highest foreign exchange rates (Nigerian Naira to a US dollar)-as at the official market; and the yearly average of the quarterly GDP of Nigeria, constituted the datasets, for the period 2019-2023 respectively.

The FTC's unsuccessful challenge alleged that Synergy's planned U.S. xray sterilization facilities would compete with Steris's gamma sterilization facilities to the benefit of consumers. Steris argued that its plans were half-baked and unlikely to come to fruition. A retrospective analysis of the merger finds support both in the trial record and in post-trial data for the FTC's challenge. In particular: (1) Steris itself appears to have used x-ray for virtually all of its incremental radiation sterilization capacity since the time of the merger; (2) Steris has become significantly more profitable since the merger consistent with (if not a dispositive indicator of) increased market power; and (3) a replication of the Synergy financial model that underpinned so much of the trial is not consistent with testimony that x-ray's financials were \"woeful\" and hence unlikely to support entry. More generally, I argue for an expected value approach to potential competition matters that jointly considers probability of entry and effects of entry, and that is more likely to enforce mergers with greater expected harm. Relative to an expected value approach, the current enforcement regime, which appears to assign greater weight to the probability of entry than to the effects of entry, is likely to overenforce mergers in which entry is likely but harms conditional on entry are small, and to underenforce mergers with a lower probability of entry but significant harms conditional on entry."}}

To interpret these stylized facts, we consider a monocentric city model in which infrastructure is a local public good and we derive a sufficient-statistics rule for its optimal spatial allocation. This rule implies that, under certain conditions, population density and land prices should fully explain spatial differences in infrastructure. We find systematic deviations from this rule, with infrastructure biased toward central neighborhoods. While aggregate losses in welfare or city size are modest, this bias shapes city structure, implying city centers 21% denser than optimal."}}

However, these methods have raised serious concerns regarding soil health, environmental sustainability, and long-term agricultural viability. This study examines the ecological impact of intensive farming on soil health in the KB Asifabad District of Telangana, India, where traditional and modern farming techniques coexist. The objectives include analysing socioeconomic factors influencing farming methods, evaluating the impact of tilling techniques and fertilizer use on soil health, and promoting sustainable practices through education and policy recommendations. Findings reveal a strong reliance on chemical fertilizers, with 98.3% of farmers using them exclusively due to their perceived efficiency and rapid results. However, this overdependence has led to soil degradation, reduced microbial diversity, and environmental pollution. Conversely, despite its ecological benefits, natural manure remains underutilized due to scepticism and economic constraints. Mechanical tilling methods, while effective, have negatively impacted soil structure and fertility. The study highlights the necessity of transitioning to sustainable practices, integrating organic inputs, and adopting conservation techniques to restore soil health and ecosystem balance. This research provides practical pathways for achieving sustainable agriculture by integrating traditional knowledge with modern practices. It is particularly relevant for policymakers, agricultural extension services, and farming communities as it highlights the need for educational initiatives, financial incentives, and regulatory measures to ensure long-term soil fertility, environmental stewardship, and improved farmer livelihoods."}}

Drawing on primary documents from Northern Ireland, Éire, and Great Britain, it traces how Unionists initially championed conscription as a way to affirm equal status with Britain, even as they upheld internal hierarchies that disadvantaged Catholics. Yet divisions within Unionist ranks, exacerbated by British reluctance to enforce conscription, challenged longstanding assumptions of Protestant \"loyalty\" and Catholic \"disloyalty.\" At the same time, Nationalists framed conscription as an illegitimate imposition by a foreign state, underscoring their self-identification as Irish citizens under occupation. Perhaps paradoxically, by forgoing conscription, Britain gained a measure of legitimacy in Catholic eyes, encouraging some Nationalists to engage more constructively with British institutions and signaling new possibilities for political accommodation. In revealing these wartime dynamics, this analysis highlights how the conscription controversy helped recalibrate citizenship, unsettle entrenched power structures, and broaden the political landscape in Northern Ireland."}}

Still, export concentration on RMG and lack of product diversification may make Bangladesh uncompetitive in the world market after Graduation. Bangladesh has met three criteria for Graduation, including the Human Asset Index (HAI), the Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI), and the Gross National Income (GNI) indices, to graduate from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) to developing ones in the third triennial review. Given this view, the study aims to assess trade preference loss and to determine the impact of graduation on exports. A combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches is followed in the study, where for quantifying the impact on export, Trade Intelligence and Negotiation Adviser (TINA) is used, and 20 KIIs are taken with the purposive sampling method to evaluate the Smooth Transition Strategies (STS) of Bangladesh. Using exploratory research methodology, the study identifies the potential problems and prospects of LDC graduation and assesses trade preference loss using TINA Simulation Tools to measure LDC preference loss. Referring to the number of UNCTAD reports, articles and secondary literature, the research sheds light on how sustainable economic growth can be secured through diversified products and internal resource mobilisation. In the post-graduation era, Bangladesh will face several challenges related to preferential market access, minimum value addition conditions, and other LDC-related leverage in developed countries’ markets. As a result, the trade loss in the post-graduation era may range from US$4.7 billion to US$17 billion as per the TINA LDC preference loss simulation. The paper identifies inefficiency in resource mobilisation and export concentration as the major hindrances to overcoming the hurdles of graduation. It is crucial for Bangladesh to include trade concerns at each level of the development planning cycle to guarantee a seamless transition process for Bangladesh. This has to be supported by robust inter-ministerial coordination and consultation procedures involving various stakeholders, both from the public and private sectors. With this participatory approach and implementation of pragmatic STS, Bangladesh can go through the process of a smooth transition to becoming a middle-income country in the near future.</p></span><span></span>"}}

We show that when a firm's peers are involved in ESG-related scandals, the fallout significantly diminishes the valuation and financial performance of the firm, despite its lack of misconduct. Using firm-level data from 42 countries, we find that an average-magnitude scandal within an industry leads to a subsequent 1.95% equity value loss for non-offending firms. This decline is primarily driven by rising operational costs, suggesting that scandals disrupt supply chains and inflate costs across the industry. Additionally, firms impacted by their peers' scandals adopt more conservative strategies, increasing cash holdings and curtailing ESG investments. We also note that smaller firms and those with robust cash reserves exhibit greater resilience to these negative spillover effects."}}

By looking at how EU law construes accepted limitations to social rights and how the Court of Justice reviews such limitations, the paper suggests that there is room for different interpretation of limitations to social rights under secondary law in view of a more coherent un-derstanding of their function under EU law. Specifically, the paper maps the accepted limitations to the social rights of EU migrants, long-term residents, and regular migrants. By reviewing the justifications put forward behind all the accepted limitations to social rights, the paper argues that the function served by limitations to social rights is uniform across all categories of migrants: that is avoiding the presumed negative effects of migration to national redistributive mechanisms. At the same time, the Court follows different paths of review depending on the status of the migrants (EU or non-EU). While some differentiation in the approach followed by the Court is justified, the paper argues that there is room for evolution in judicial review by combining elements of the judicial approach for both EU and non-EU migrants in light of the social objectives of the EU under Article 3 TEU and the Charter. The paper presents the potential of this combination not as a groundbreaking shift in the functional approach followed by EU law to social rights, but rather as a limited change that can bring about more extensive protection of social rights for all migrants."}}

Under the Decision, the ECB innovatively reconfigured part of its operations to steer financial markets toward sustainable finance. While institutionally empowering, the Decision also incorporates self-restraining choices that prevent the ECB from encroaching on the EU legislator's prerogative to set climate policy.

PPS sampling technique assigns more selection possibilities to units with higher size measures; it shows significant efficiency in such applications. By using auxiliary information to increase precision, a new generalized class of estimate techniques helps to compute the population mean under PPS sampling. The approach follows an actual radiation science application by means of average ambient radiation measurements over a geographical area whose topic selection probability corresponds with area size and population distribution. Because they show lower MSE, which makes them advantageous for radiological risk assessment attached with environmental health monitoring, the suggested estimators show better performance than adopted existing estimators."}}

Based on 286 monthly observations (January 2000–October 2023), the results reveal significant negative price elasticities—from -0.795 for total US imports to -1.808 for low-tech US goods—with progressively lower elasticities in medium-tech (-0.512 to -0.796) and high-tech segments (-0.444 to -0.779), reflecting limited substitution at higher technological complexity. Cross-price elasticities show competition between China and the US in low-tech goods, complementarity in medium-tech imports, and EU specialization in high-tech products. The findings highlight structural dependencies and technological asymmetries shaping import responses to macroeconomic fluctuations, with notable variation in adjustment speeds—slower for Chinese low-tech imports (-0.185), faster for European imports (-1.369). Overall, the results underscore the vulnerabilities of resource-dependent economies with limited exchange rate flexibility and high technological reliance amid global trade disruptions."}}

In this work, we propose a novel one-stage training strategy named Balanced Optimal Transport Consistency Learning (BOTCL) to obtain balanced representations for long-tailed data. Considering the imbalanced feature distribution in conventional consistency learning, we implement head-tail feature fusion and feature memory bank to enhance the optimal transport (OT) process in tail classes, resulting in more balanced feature learning. Instead of directly comparing blended features, consistency learning with OT maps features into a lower-dimensional probability distribution space, alleviating the challenges associated with high-dimensional comparisons in long-tailed tasks. Moreover, the distribution-aware alignment provided by OT enhances the discriminative capability of head–tail fused representations. Extensive experiments on various long-tailed benchmarks demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed method over the previous state-of-the-art."}}

However, we fail to find any aggregate relationship between behavior in the first decision of a bandit and belief updating, risk aversion, cognitive reflection scores, and contingent reasoning. Overall, our results are consistent with subjects disliking options that currently have a larger variance in the probability of returning a reward.

We used causal analyses to attribute changes in mangrove deforestation to policy and law adoption. We considered protected areas along with national scale policies restricting cutting and clearing, presence of a mangrove-specific policy, and coordination mechanisms. From 1996-2011, cutting and clearing restrictions reduced mangrove losses by up to 59%, but their effectiveness has diminished more recently. Protected areas also reduced mangrove loss, and were most effective in nations that lacked cutting and clearing restrictions.

Nevertheless, it encounters significant obstacles in the 3D domain, primarily due to the scarcity of available data and the considerable challenge of effectively capturing hierarchical structures. Current methods in Euclidean space suffer from feature distortion and fail to model the semantic hierarchies inherent in cross-modal data. These challenges motivate us to adopt hyperbolic space, which excels at capturing multi-scale relationships and preserving the geometric structure of complex data. In this paper, we propose HyperPoint, the first unified method for point cloud representation learning in hyperbolic space. By projecting cross-modal features such as 3D point cloud, 2D images, and text into hyperbolic space, we leverage its tree-like properties to encode semantic hierarchies with minimal distortion. Our method integrates generative and contrastive learning while leveraging multi-loss optimization to enhance feature diversity and consistency. HyperPoint achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, e.g., 96.1% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, 94.1% accuracy on 10w10s on ModelNet40."}}

Our analysis reveals that these two measures are only weakly correlated and exhibit strikingly different spatial patterns, with traditional social capital highest in rural areas and digital social capital concentrated in metropolitan regions. Each measure captures complementary, but not substitutable, dimensions of community connectedness.

To do so, data on wages of production workers and salaries of skilled employees were sourced from the Annual Survey of Industries. The data has been deflated and concorded using appropriate deflators and concordance, respectively. To trace the differentials and structural changes in average wage and average salary, graphical and time trend growth rate methods were used. The findings indicate that the industry has experienced significant structural changes in wage-salary differentials since 1981. The salaries paid to skilled employees have grown much faster than the wages paid to production workers. Indeed, the wage-salary gap widened over the study period, specifically, the post-reform period. Additionally, skilled employees remain closely linked to faster adoption of technology and productivity growth, indicating an increasing intensity of capital and technological improvements. It suggests that food processors and policymakers must plan well-coordinated application of labour, capital and technology in food processing operations so that India can keep up with the growing demand for processed food products in domestic and export markets."}}

We study the impact of financial speculation, driven by cash flow disagreement, on the welfare of households that do not participate in the stock market and save in the risk-free asset. Without additional frictions, households forego the equity premium, which reduces their consumption share, though speculation itself does not affect it. While speculation increases asset price volatility and causes significant fluctuations in speculators' consumption shares, it does not affect the volatility of households' shares. Our findings challenge the view that speculation negatively affects households, instead suggesting that financial exclusion, not speculative excess, is the key barrier to wealth accumulation.

Empirical evidence demonstrates that increased public attention to climate risks significantly extends corporate debt maturity, driving firms toward long-term debt structures. To address endogeneity concerns, instrumental variable methods and System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) analyses confirm the robustness of these findings. The mediation mechanisms reveal that public climate risk concerns have dual effects: quantitatively, they tighten external financing constraints and amplify short-term liquidity risks; qualitatively, they reduce corporate greenwashing practices, foster \"green trust,\" and expand access to long-term green investment funding, thereby incentivizing debt maturity extension. The heterogeneity analysis shows that when the corporate reputation is better and the property right is state-owned, the long-term effect of corporate debt structure under the public climate risk is more obvious; In addition, due to the complementarity and regional differences between public climate risk concerns and external environmental regulation, when the environmental regulation is stronger and the geographical location is in the north, the effect of public climate risk concerns on the long-term debt structure of enterprises is more significant. By integrating public climate risk perceptions into debt structure analysis, this research contributes to the theoretical framework of corporate debt optimization and provides new insights for managing debt maturity selection and mitigating financial risks in an era of climate uncertainty."}}

Daily Phase II–IV prices (2008–2024) are combined with monthly climate proxies in a two-step GARCH-MIDAS design. First, a state-space filter extracts the stochastic trend in global temperature anomalies; the trend’s first difference captures incremental shifts in the warming path. Second, an indicator flags months when the exponentiated trend exceeds its 88th percentile, isolating extreme shifts rather than ordinary weather noise. Both proxies load negatively in the MIDAS filter: faster warming and more frequent extreme shifts are associated with lower conditional variance once high-frequency weather shocks are removed. Out-of-sample, the climate-augmented model reduces one-day-ahead volatility errors by roughly 20% relative to the best conventional GARCH, a lead validated by Model Confidence Set and Diebold–Mariano tests. Feeding these forecasts into a mean–variance rule delivers higher excess and certainty-equivalent returns across risk-aversion levels. Incorporating slow moving climate metrics therefore sharpens volatility estimates and yields a clear volatility dampening effect, enhancing risk-management tools for investors and regulators."}}

While structured financial variables have long served as dominant predictors, recent work explores incorporating sentiment from textual disclosures. However, most approaches rely on coarse document-level sentiment, neglecting the topical context in which sentiment appears, limiting interpretability and predictive power. Further, robust topic-extraction itself remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose FinTextSim-LLM, a scalable and interpretable framework for extracting topic-specific sentiment from 10-K filings. Our approach combines FinTextSim, a domain-specific sentence-transformer, with a lightweight, retrieval-augmented generation setup. Over 90% of sentences are classified via efficient embedding-based similarity. Only ambiguous cases, identified through entropy and silhouette score, are passed to an LLM, guided by keywords, topic definitions, document context and labeled examples. This hybrid design injects domain-knowledge, improves efficiency and enhances transparency, addressing key concerns about LLM deployment in financial settings. Empirically, FinTextSim-LLM achieves 98.2% coverage, substantially outperforming embedding-clustering and LLM-based topic modeling methods. When integrated into predictive models, FinTextSim-LLM’s topic-specific sentiment significantly enhances forecasts of changes in diluted earnings per share, outperforming financial-only models, and exceeding the effect of document-level sentiment by up to 49%. Our findings highlight the predictive value of aligning sentiment with economic topics and demonstrate that interpretable, finegrained textual signals can meaningfully improve forecasting of corporate performance. FinTextSim-LLM offers a practical pathway for researchers and practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into high-stakes financial applications while ensuring transparency, scalability, and domain alignment."}}

A dishonest claim that exceeds one's true entitlement imposes a negative externality on others. To explore such social dilemmas, we introduce a novel four-player game where each player rolls a die in private and earns their die report, subject to budget availability. We vary the timing of players' reporting (simultaneous vs sequential moves) and the available budget (limited vs excess). When resources are limited, mean reports do not differ significantly between simultaneous and sequential treatments. However, simultaneous reporting promotes greater equity under scarcity and reduces dishonesty when resources are plentiful. Frequent displays of virtue signaling take place whereby Player 4 chooses to earn zero by reporting more than the remaining budget. Our results demonstrate that these social dilemmas can be better managed by promoting simultaneous reporting structures, which obscure information about individual claims."}}

Our findings reveal that climate risk encountered by firms encourages the implementation of flexible employment practices. The mechanism test shows that climate risk promotes flexible employment by increasing labor costs, financing costs, innovation investments, and adoption of artificial intelligence. Additional analysis indicates that climate risk positively affects flexible employment application in non-labor-intensive enterprises and firms in the non-recessionary period of their life cycle. This study uncovers the link between climate risk and flexible employment in enterprises, providing empirical evidence for firms to address climate-related challenges and optimize their human resource structures."}}

Yet, monetary authorities' track records of managing inflation with respect to the stated policy objectives have varied significantly. This paper examines how inflation targeting track records affect asset prices within three common asset classes: stocks, bonds, and exchange rates. The analysis reveals heterogeneous and enduring effects of track records on financial markets. A stronger track record in inflation targeting leads to a more negative reaction from stock markets to inflationary pressures, with effects persisting for about four quarters. Additionally, the sensitivity of rising long-term sovereign bond yields to inflation diminishes for about three quarters as the track record improves. Moreover, credible inflation targeters are more likely to allow greater flexibility in exchange rates to deal with inflationary shocks. Consequently, credible inflation targeting track records produce desirable policy outcomes by reinforcing monetary policy transmission and saving fiscal space."}}

Canadian jurisprudence has largely taken this assumption to be true. Interrogating the historical jurisprudence supporting the prohibition on patentability of methods of medical treatment, this article demonstrates that this jurisprudence is far from clear as to whether the issue is, or should be, approached as a question of patentability or infringement. An analysis of the case law on both patentability of methods of medical treatment, and what constitutes infringing ‘use’ of an invention, demonstrates that both lines of jurisprudence share similar concepts and underlying concerns. This has generated uncertainty as to whether the issue of extending patent protection to methods of medical treatment has ever clearly been a question of patentability. Rather, examining both lines of jurisprudence side-by-side, this piece demonstrates that concerns underlying extension of patent protection to cover methods of medical treatment have historically been categorized as scope of protection concerns, rather than patentability concerns. As such, the debate surrounding patent protection and methods of medical treatment is best characterized as an infringement issue.<span></span>"}}

A bivariate Markov switching ARCH (SWARCH) model is designed to evaluate four possible combinations of the volatility states which can characterize both the domestic and world markets, thus allowing the generation of state-varying portfolio loadings on the basis of 4-state correlations. The following conclusions are drawn. First, the domestic and global markets are more strongly correlated when both simultaneously find themselves in the same state of volatility. Conversely, this correlation is weaker when a different volatility state characterizes each market. Furthermore, the circumstances in which both the domestic and global stock markets simultaneously experience high levels of volatility prove strongest cross-market correlations, and result in least effective at reducing the risk stemming from international portfolio diversification. Next, this study determines state-varying portfolio loadings which prove effective at the task of asset allocation, particularly under conditions of market volatility. Finally, filtering structural changes out from the variance-switching process leads to a considerable decrease of the time variation involved in generating state-varying portfolio loadings, which, in turn, leads to lower transaction costs when compared to the performance of the conventional GARCH model."}}

However, these attributes often fade when the environment to nurture them is non-existent. In a society like Nigeria where economic challenges are constantly on the rise, this lack of support can lead to more serious problems. Many children are forced to take on economic responsibilities, becoming active contributors to their family's income instead of focusing on their education. While helping their family is not bad in itself, the severity of what is done is not defined and the extent to which it is done is unregulated. This results in a pervasive practice of child labour, contributing to an increasing out-of-school problem. In respect to children's innate curiosity and strength, the core argument of this essay is that sports possess the capacity to pull students back into school. Sports such as football, athletics, basketball and others are not only culturally acceptable in Nigeria but also embodies the psychosocial attributes needed to promote self-esteem among children, particularly adolescents. As such, social work interventions must explore its viability to stimulate interest of child labourers in learning. This essay offers practical steps of achieving them, recognizing the role of local agents and allies in reducing the problem of child labour."}}

This theory posits that domestic institutions are the result of international strategic pressure exerted by the system of international relations in which sovereign states are embedded. Inclusive institutions are an equilibrium result from a competitive system of international relations that features many states, each with a high degree of local sovereignty. If there is a world empire or a decentralized international system with a strong and stable hegemon, the equilibrium outcome tends towards highly extractive institutions. Therefore, this paper argues that polycentrism in state power is a necessary and perhaps sufficient condition for inclusive institutions and, thus, for economic prosperity among the general population."}}

It argues that the conventional interpretation of lobbying data—as indicative of a competitive political marketplace—is both empirically flawed and conceptually misleading. Empirical deficiencies in the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), such as shadow lobbying, underreporting, and the proliferation of opaque influence channels like \"dark money,\" render the data deeply incomplete. More fundamentally, the paper critiques the underlying market analogy itself, showing how political influence is exercised through complex, multi-channel strategies that include substitution, complementation, and psychological priming—none of which are captured by lobbying disclosures. The article introduces the concept of dynamic substitution to explain how influence-seeking behavior has migrated from corporate lobbying to capital-based political spending, particularly following Citizens United. This shift has empowered ultra-wealthy individuals, whose political investments are decoupled from specific firms and more aligned with portfolio-wide ideological goals. These capital-holders fund expansive political infrastructures that operate through super PACs, nonprofit advocacy, media, and academia, further bypassing traditional transparency mechanisms. Drawing on analogies from antitrust law and theories of cumulative advantage, the article argues that the stability of lobbying data is not evidence of a lack of political concentration, but a reflection of entrenched political capture. It concludes that rising economic concentration, by enriching a small cohort of dominant shareholders, has enabled a self-reinforcing loop of political influence that erodes democratic responsiveness. By reframing political influence as a cumulative and structurally embedded phenomenon, the article calls for broader analytic and policy frameworks capable of capturing this evolving architecture of power."}}

Our approach captures not only individual differences but also developmental and gender-specific tuning patterns across the lifespan. By accounting for within-task adaptation, we produce robust estimates of ability that more accurately explain observed behavior.

This paper constructs and analyzes a novel dataset that codes the presence of race-based restrictions on voting in 130 jurisdictions (primarily English-speaking subnational jurisdictions with substantial power to determine their electoral law) over 1730-2000. It documents extensive variation in these restrictions over time and across jurisdictions, exhibiting a cyclical pattern in sharp contrast to the continuous decline in class-based voting restrictions. To explain this variation, the paper uses a framework that emphasizes the distinction between centralized imperial control and the empowerment of local European settlers. A stacked event study analysis of the independence of colonies of settlement shows an absence of pre-trends, and implies that independence had a substantial positive effect on the probability of a racially restrictive franchise. The findings are similar but weaker for other forms of settler empowerment, such as dominion status. These results are robust to controlling for the existence and abolition of property (and other economic) qualifications for voting. They are consistent with a framework in which an imperial or federal government is less subject to capture by local settler elites, and thus more likely to promote franchise extension."}}

An Environmental Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (EDSGE) model analysis shows that i) increased GVC participation, with higher reliance on imported intermediate goods, slows economic growth more significantly in high-pollution regimes, ii) stronger cross-border carbon emission externalities reduce economic growth in high-pollution regimes in the initial stages, iii) the emphasis on environmental issues in monetary policy has insignificant impact on carbon emissions while increasing macroeconomic volatility to more polluted regimes, and iv) enhanced cross-border environmental policy complementarity might initially benefit high-pollution regimes; however, delayed adjustment costs result in adverse effects over time. These findings suggest that while less stringent environmental policies may offer short-term benefits, these are outweighed by higher long-term transition costs. Therefore, a proactive environmental policy, aimed at achieving a 'Net Zero 2050' scenario, could foster more stable economic conditions. Furthermore, the environmental concerns in monetary policy should be moderated to mitigate potential side effects of indirect interventions on carbon emissions."}}

This policy constituted an exogenous change in the ability to emigrate away from Moldova, drastically increasing emigration from the country. After this policy change, we find economic institutions improved in Moldova in a statistically significant way, and these effects are robust to sensitivity analysis. Our results suggest emigration improves economic institutions and that immigration restrictions in wealthy, immigrant-receiving countries may be negatively influencing institutions and economic development in poor, immigrant-sending countries."}}

In this research work, copper mine tailings (from the Khetri region of Banwas, Rajasthan, India) are used for partial cement replacement in the concrete. A concrete blend with a ratio of water/cement of 0.4 is designed to form sustainable concrete by mixing out cement with copper tailing at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. The adaptability of material properties was evaluated by EDAX & XRF. The mechanical performance of concrete was analyzed on 7, 28, 56, & 84-day matured samples. Microstructural analyses were commenced by studying the morphologies of concrete samples through SEM and XRD. Results indicate improvement in mechanical performance at 5%-10% cement replacement with copper tailings waste. It was concluded that green concrete may be formed with copper tailings waste as binder at lower replacement levels."}}

Additionally, we refine the concept of a self-serving belief system, first introduced by Krishna and Morgan (2001b) in the context of uncertainty. We show that for a partition equilibrium to emerge, two conditions are necessary: a) the noise distribution must be bounded and common knowledge, and b) the experts’ biases are suﬃciently large and point in opposite directions."}}

This revealsan overlooked ex-ante mechanism, where firms respond to UI incentives when postingvacanciesbefore meeting workersrather than only through ex post adjustments.

The analysis reveals that firm exit was more prevalent in EU member states, likely due to stricter crisis-related restrictions. Socio-economic variables such as population density, tourism dependence, and health expenditures played a critical role, while institutional quality, contrary to expectations, was associated with higher exit rates during crises. The banking sector played a role in influencing firm resilience through credit provision and financial support mechanisms. The Russo-Ukrainian war further amplified survival risks, especially for firms located in countries geographically or economically exposed to the conflict. The findings offer valuable insights for designing targeted policy interventions aimed at enhancing business resilience in vulnerable and institutionally diverse environments."}}

We develop a model in which users act as both creators and consumers, differing in their ideological affiliation and propensity to produce toxic content. Affective polarization - users’ aversion to ideologically opposed content - interacts with moderation in unintended ways. Even ideologically neutral moderation that targets only toxicity can suppress non-toxic content creation, particularly from ideological minorities. Our analysis reveals a content-level externality: when toxic content is removed, non-toxic posts gain exposure. While majority-group creators sometimes benefit from this exposure, they do not internalize the negative spillovers, i.e., increased out-group hostility toward minority creators. This discourages minority expression and polarizes the content supply, ultimately leaving minority users in a more ideologically imbalanced environment: a mechanism reminiscent of the “spiral of silence.” Modeling creation as a strategic response to moderation, we underscore the importance of eliciting whether user engagement reflects toxicity or ideological disagreement in guiding platform governance."}}

To this end, we conducted a dedicated meta-survey in 2019 and repeated it as part of the regular ifo Business Survey in 2025. Our results show that internal factors – such as profit situation, demand, and turnover – are the primary drivers of firms’ assessments. However, external influences, particularly the economic policy framework and general economic sentiment, have gained importance in recent years. These findings enhance the interpretability of the index and contribute to understanding its strong forecasting performance. The identified factors may also prove valuable for applied business cycle analysis."}}

In the second stage, we examine their determinants using Bayesian Model Averaging. We find that risk sharing enhances consumption smoothing only ex post through international borrowing and lending, while it does not improve it ex ante though international portfolio diversification. The results provide support for the \"diminishing international diversification potential\" hypothesis. Moreover, we find that the relationship between capital mobility, and generally openness of the economy is ambiguous. While openness facilitates risk sharing opportunities, it also increases consumption volatility through a higher degree of economic specialization and the risks of financial contagion."}}

The dynamic nature of migration in Odisha is quite evident from our analysis. The southern region of Odisha has the highest share of temporary and seasonal migration followed by the northern and southern regions. Intra-state migration is the predominant form of migration in the northern region of Odisha whereas interstate migration is the predominant form of migration in coastal and southern Odisha. In the northern region, the agriculture sector is the highest receiver of migrants and in southern Odisha, the construction sector is the highest receiver of migrants. In sharp contrast to both of these two regions, the other sectors are top employers of migrants in coastal regions. The multivariate logistic regression indicates that the southern region has 5.731 times and northern regions have a 2.3 times higher likelihood to migrate than the coastal region. Females, the richest and males were found to have a lower likelihood of migration in Odisha."}}

To examine whether correcting misperceptions increases take-up, I conducted an RCT with 6,225 university students across Germany who were not receiving aid. I find that 63% of students systematically underestimate the financial benefits and overestimate repayment obligations of student aid, and 86% misperceive their eligibility. Providing combined information about the program conditions and individual eligibility significantly corrected misperceptions after six months and increased take-up by 46% after one year. This increase is particularly strong among disadvantaged students. After take-up, students report higher available income while reducing earnings and parental support. These findings suggest that correcting misperceptions can reduce social inequality by alleviating financial constraints among disadvantaged students and their parents."}}

Officials from the majority group largely excluded from tax farming (i.e., the indigenous) strongly reduced reliance on tax farming. In contrast, officials from the minority group traditionally wooed as tax farmers (i.e., the non-indigenous Asians) did not reduce such reliance.

We demonstrate an efficient parallel implementation of this Volterra Neural Network (VNN), along with its remarkable performance while retaining a relatively simpler and potentially more tractable structure. Furthermore, we show a rather sophisticated adaptation of this network to nonlinearly fuse the RGB (spatial) information and the Optical Flow (temporal) information of a video sequence for action recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets for action recognition, and is shown to outperform state of the art CNN approaches.

The Transformasi Ekonomi Kampung Terpadu (TEKAD) program, a partnership between the Indonesian government and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), aims to transform rural economies through participatory planning, micro-enterprise support, and enhanced financial and institutional access. This study employs a sequential mixed-methods approach, analysing quantitative data from 698 households across 47 villages in ten regencies, complemented by qualitative insights from interviews, observations, and document reviews. Six outcomes are evaluated: agricultural productivity, financial access, investment satisfaction, technology adoption, institutional support, and market access. TEKAD exceeded targets for financial access (33.4%) and market access (30.9%) but underperformed in productivity (39.1%), technology adoption (59.6%), institutional trust (40.8%), and investment satisfaction (40.4%), particularly in fisheries and regions with weak governance. People with disabilities faced significant exclusion, highlighting deficiencies in TEKAD’s Gender Equality, Disability, and Social Inclusion (GEDSI) framework. The findings reveal tensions between decentralised development and implementation consistency, aligning with adaptive governance scholarship. Recommendations include context-sensitive strategies, universal design principles, and integrated value-chain planning to enhance equitable rural transformation in Indonesia and similar settings."}}

A structured survey was administered to 398 randomly selected maize farmers across 11 sub-districts in Jeneponto. Primary data were collected and analyzed quantitatively using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS software to examine the causal relationships among variables. The findings reveal that farmer characteristics, such as age, education, landholding size, and farming experience, significantly influence participation in institutional activities. External institutional support—through government policies, extension services, and private sector involvement—positively affects participation. Farmer-driven factors like capacity building and access to timely information are also key motivators for active engagement. However, the quality of extension services was found to have no significant impact on participation. Institutional attributes like innovation and member cohesiveness contribute positively, albeit less significantly, to participation and strengthening outcomes. Notably, farmer involvement in planning, implementation, evaluation, and utilization processes significantly enhances institutional strengthening. Active participation emerges as a critical foundation for robust institutional development. This study contributes to the literature by examining farmer institutions in a maize production center characterized by early-stage institutional development. By integrating internal (farmer characteristics) and external (institutional support) determinants within a structural model, it offers a comprehensive framework for understanding institutional strengthening. The findings underscore the need for local governments to design enabling policies that foster institutional participation. Recommendations include investing in infrastructure, promoting access to modern technologies, and implementing community-based empowerment initiatives to support sustainable agricultural institutions."}}

The findings show how these programs not only foster mutual understanding and academic collaboration, but also promote significant personal growth among participants. The research identifies critical challenges and opportunities within these exchange programs. Such systems are essential to facilitate a balanced flow of students between the EU and Japan, ensuring reasonable benefits. In light of these insights, the study offers strategic recommendations aimed at expanding and enhancing the reach and quality of these exchange programs. Suggestions include increasing funding opportunities, improving support services for international students, and fostering policies that encourage a broader participation base equally between both regions. These initiatives promise to not only strengthen EU-Japan relations into the future but also to support a more interconnected global educational landscape."}}

The regression analysis results show that board size has a negative and significant effect on bank performance as measured by Return on Assets (ROA). This finding indicates that the larger the number of board members, the lower the bank&apos;s performance, in line with the hypothesis in agency theory which states that an overly large board can hinder the effectiveness of decision-making and increase the potential for conflicts of interest. In contrast, control variables such as bank size, loans, deposits, and capital show a positive and significant relationship with ROA, reflecting that an increase in earning assets and liquidity supports bank profitability. Meanwhile, the NPL ratio shows a significant negative effect, confirming that high non-performing loans can suppress financial performance."}}

In the model, the bank distributes dividends and issues costly equity to maximise shareholder value, while its assets generate stochastic income under timevarying macroeconomic conditions. We solve the bank's stochastic control problem and derive the distribution of its capital buffers in closed form. Imposing dividend taxes (or bans) in bad macroeconomic states generates an intertemporal trade-off, as it encourages capital buffers accumulation in those states but promotes dividend payouts in the good ones. Furthermore, the policy undermines financial stability by reducing the bank's value and weakening its incentives to recapitalise in both good and bad states. Coordinating dividend taxes with counter-cyclical capital requirements can mitigate value losses and ease the trade-off, but it also exacerbates disincentives for recapitalisation."}}

We identify the ratios that the rating agencies employ in rating MDBs and compute, for a stylised example MDB, how much this MDB can expand its lending before different ratios trigger ratings downgrades.</p>\n<p>The modeling of ratings impact is based on a detailed analysis of CRA methodologies, building on Risk Control’s experience in working on the application of these methodologies to actual MDBs. The calculations are performed using Risk Control’s Rating Scenario System. This software replicates the full scorecard of MDB ratings for the three major rating agencies, Fitch, Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s. The analysis&nbsp; demonstrates the considerable variation among the MDB rating methodologies of the three major agencies and how their criteria bind in very different ways as a particular MDB changes its strategy.</p>\n<p>The calculations are performed using asset, liability and other financial data for a stylised MDB. Development Related Asset (DRA) data for this MDB have been created using publicly available information from other existing MDBs. The liability non-DRA asset and other financial data employed are comparable to data that we have encountered in earlier assignments with MDBs. The rating exercise reported here is a conceptual experiment designed to improve understanding of how MDB ratings are affected by increases in lending. The “stylized” MDB employed is designed to be realistic and representative but the actual impact of expansion on ratings can vary substantially across MDBs, depending on other aspects of their activities and business model. The numbers we present should, therefore, not be interpreted as the actual lending headroom of other MDBs.</p>"}}

Increased online instruction leaves mens exam performance unaffected but significantly lowers womens performance, particularly in math-intensive courses. Online instruction also reduces womens longer-run performance and increases their study dropout. Exploring mechanisms, we find that women exposed to more online lectures report greater difficulty in connecting with peers, less engaging instructors, and lower course satisfaction. Our findings suggest that shifting toward more online instruction may disproportionally harm women."}}

This study estimates the causal impact of Medicaid expansion to 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level on maternal and infant health outcomes, using county-level data from the National Vital Statistics System (2010-2017). We employ a difference-indifferences design, comparing counties in expansion and non-expansion states, and use inverse propensity score weighting to improve covariate balance. To flexibly adjust for baseline differences, we extend the analysis with a machine learning-based Doubly Robust DiD estimator. Our findings show that Medicaid expansion significantly reduced pregnancy-associated mortality among non-Hispanic Black mothers, primarily by lowering pregnancy-related deaths, with no effect on incidental causes. No significant impact is found for non-Hispanic White mothers. While infant mortality rates remained unchanged for both groups, the expansion modestly improved birthweight outcomes among Black infants. These results highlight the potential of Medicaid expansion to reduce racial disparities in maternal and infant health in the American South."}}

What then bridges heterogeneities in retail means of payments? By interlinking various legal nuances into money and payments, the overarching apexes of this paper is to argue that (1) convertibility into banknotes free of any major frictions bridges heterogeneities across all retail means of payments to safeguard financial stability and the monetary sovereignty of the domestic hegemon; (2) as convertibility into retail central bank money bridges the divide between retail means of payments, it is the retail anchor (as opposed to the wholesale) function of central bank money that predominantly secures fungibility in retail means of payments; (3) frictions during the convertibility processor the belief that frictions will develop in the near future-subverts the symbiosis across all means of payments and lifts the veil that in reality retail means of payments exhibit a degree of heterogeneity; (4) with the ever-increasing \"electronification\" of payment habits in society, the potency of banknotes to bridge heterogeneities may weaken."}}

This study introduces the PESTEL indicator framework, utilizing sample space coordinates instead of traditional geographic distances in Kriging methods to establish spatial autocorrelation relationships. This approach more precisely captures the influence of differences in economic development levels and social acceptance across countries on ADANES reprocessing costs. Based on this framework, an Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation model was constructed using unit price samples from nine countries globally to provide unbiased linear estimation of ADANES reprocessing costs in China. Using China&apos;s ADANES demonstration project as an empirical case study, the model was applied to achieve spent fuel reprocessing and refabrication cost estimation, yielding a result of $1,414/kgHM. After determining the data and supplementing interpolation parameters, the LCOE for ADANES reprocessing was further calculated. The research findings provide critical data for economic evaluation of this project and offer replicable methodology and practical experience for economic assessment of cutting-edge nuclear technologies globally, supporting nuclear technology innovation and sustainable development."}}

Central to the proposed model is the integration of sustainable biomass specifically the Paulownia tree and recycled water, addressing critical challenges posed by fossil fuel dependency and underscoring the importance of transitioning toward renewable energy sources. To achieve this, a multi-objective mathematical model is formulated to concurrently minimize total costs, meet demand, and reduce environmental impacts. The model incorporates supply and demand uncertainties and applies the LP-metric method for optimization. To ensure balanced decision-making across multiple objectives, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used to assign appropriate weights to each goal. The methodology further includes sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of key variables such as biomass supply, price volatility, and demand fluctuations. Additionally, Pareto analysis is conducted to identify optimal trade-offs among conflicting objectives. The findings reveal that the inclusion of recycled water and wastewater not only relieves pressure on natural resources but also significantly enhances the economic and environmental performance of the supply chain. Moreover, the integration of Paulownia biomass improves system flexibility and reduces associated risks. Through the use of epsilon-constraint and Pareto frontier analysis, the model provides decision-makers with adaptable solutions aligned with their strategic priorities. the study offers a practical and comprehensive approach to the design and management of sustainable biofuel supply chains, supporting long-term resource efficiency and contributing to global sustainable development goals by reducing reliance on fossil fuels."}}

Among these, tax incentives are the most prevalent. However, their effectiveness in promoting overall social welfare remains a subject of debate.This study examines the effects of a policy aimed at encouraging angel investment in early-stage startups. The policy, known as the Angel Act, was implemented in Israel during 2011–2015 and revised 2016–2019. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that these policies had adverse effects on early-stage angel investments. Specifically, while total angel investments increased; the likelihood and number of angel investments in seed stage startups’ financing rounds decreased and so was the amount invested per angel in early-stage startups.This counterintuitive outcome raises a key question: Why would tax incentives intended to stimulate early-stage investment—and which investors can opt not to use—produce the opposite effect? To address this, we evaluated several alternative explanations. Our analyses suggests that the negative effect stems from adverse signaling associated with startups that either did not seek or did not obtain certification under the Angels’ Act. Such startups may be perceived by investors as higher risk or of lower quality, deterring angels due to concerns about the startups’ reputation. As a result, angel investors may have shifted their focus toward later-stage startups, which were not targeted by the policy because of their age or scope, and thus their quality was not questioned.This explanation carries significant policy implications. It highlights the potential unintended consequences of government entrepreneurship support policies that selectively grant benefits to qualifying startups. Such policies can inadvertently generate negative signals about non-qualifying firms, undermining their perceived quality and counteracting the policy’s intended goals. Policymakers should consider these potential adverse signaling effects when designing support mechanisms-particularly when implemented by high-reputation government agencies, where the signaling risk is even greater."}}

California and others have imposed annual sales requirements on truck manufacturers, coupled with purchase incentives with a limited state funding. To minimize the fiscal impact of government-funded incentives, we propose a self-financing rebate program for Class 4-8 trucks, using California as a case study. This is the first known study of truck feebates in the U.S. context, and likely globally. Under the scheme, diesel truck purchase or ownership would incur a fee, while ZET purchases would receive rebates. We consider various policy designs premised on revenue-neutrality (no cost to government) and minimizing cost burdens for transitioning fleets. Two design options are explored with multiple scenarios: a one-time upfront fee on diesel trucks at the point of sale or an annual fee on all operating diesel trucks, with the revenue used to finance rebates on ZET purchases. As an example, a one-time fee of 7% of the new diesel truck purchase price (~ $5,100 to $20,400 per truck) or an annual fee of $290-$820 per diesel truck, depending on the class, could support rebates for 74,600 ZETs. Rebates decline from up to $277,000 in the first year to up to $40,000 in the last year as ZET sales spur. Any “excess” revenues could support ZET transition by funding charging infrastructure or incentivizing used ZETs. The annual fee approach provides the broadest funding base with modest fees."}}

Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar between 2000 and 2024 using PRISMA guidelines. The search yielded 415 records, with 36 studies. The PICOS framework guided inclusion criteria. Results: EIB is linked to osmotic and thermal stress during exercise, leading to airway inflammation [1-3]. Diagnostic approaches include spirometry, exercise challenge, EVH, and mannitol testing [1-3]. Non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies (e.g., SABAs, ICS, LTRAs, biologics) show efficacy [4-6]. PRISMA flow diagram and bias assessments were applied. Conclusion: EIB is underdiagnosed but manageable with structured diagnosis and therapy. Personalized treatment and newer biologic options offer hope for refractory cases [14,15]."}}

In addition to the argument that these taxes violate international tax principles, the US considers that they are discriminatory. This article uses this claim as a basis to analyse the likelihood for DSTs to be incompatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) law. First, it provides an overview of the unilateral, regional and multilateral tax proposals to mitigate the challenges of the digitalized economy. Second, it discusses the main legal issues that could arise under the law of the WTO, focusing on legal issues under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). While recognising that there may be good tax policy reasons to oppose DSTs, this article concludes that arguments based on WTO law provide, if at all, a weak justification to oppose such taxes."}}

India passed legislation requiring one woman director on the board of directors of publicly traded and some other significant companies (Section 149 (1)). Even though India's constitution guarantees equal rights to men and women. Women still are undervalued within the workplace. As a result, women's options are limited. However, the situation has changed/diversified nowadays. Women have also made inroads into several corporate boardrooms, albeit in a limited capacity. In this situation, the Companies Act, 2013 has provided provision for the appointment of female directors to the boards of publicly traded companies, which is a positive step. This is a step in the direction of gender equality. This research focuses on female director representation on boards of directors and its impact. It is a step in the right direction. Assuring stronger levels of openness and accountability and attempting to align India's corporate governance processes with international best practices. Gender bias is a problem not only in India but also in industrialized countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, etc. So, certainly, there is a lot of room for us to grow. It is past time we gave our female counterparts equal opportunities to contribute to humanity's advancement. A legal provision can be sufficient to reduce gender bias. People on boards of directors can use their differences to improve corporate governance. At a global level, the inclusion of women on boards of directors tends to have a beneficial impact on shareholder value. In boardroom conversations, there is a need for a plurality of viewpoints. Whether women directors have aided in strengthening the company's overall image since their appointment as women directors. The study that women on boards of directors have a beneficial impact on company success.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>A board of directors that is properly organised and capable of making independent decisions for the company's benefit is the result of good corporate governance.

Non-fatal strangulation (NFS) is a common and dangerous form of intimate partner violence (IPV) and a predictor of homicide, yet it was historically neglected by the criminal justice system. Since the year 2000, most U.S. states have enacted laws enlisting NFS as a standalone criminal offense. We compile a novel dataset on state NFS statutes and link it to the FBI Supplementary Homicide Reports from 1990 to 2019 to estimate the causal effects of these laws on IPH rates. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, and an estimator that accounts for staggered adoption and treatment heterogeneity, we find that NFS laws led to significant reductions in IPH rates. We estimate that these laws reduce female-victim IPH by 14% and male-victim IPH by 36%, among victims aged 18-34. No significant effects are observed for victims 50 and above or for homicides committed by strangers. Event-study estimates support the parallel trends assumption. Our findings suggest that NFS laws can disrupt the escalation of IPV and reduce lethal outcomes."}}

Instead of batching and optimizing exchanges over a fixed pool of incompatible patient-donor pairs, the busiest programs now operate dynamically, matching pairs as they arrive. This feature has also sparked interest in dynamic matching mechanisms. Yet for general matching problems with high-dimensional state spaces, a full characterization of optimal dynamic mechanisms remains elusive, and only approximate solutions are known. We develop a new methodology to characterize and compute dynamically optimal mechanisms for bilateral matching over arbitrary state spaces, provided that compatibility between agent types follows a linear spatial structure. This technique applies to optimal dynamic kidney exchange and extends to other spatial matching problems. Our approach leverages second-order properties of the value function, extending recent advances in Markov Decision Processes and queueing systems, which traditionally focus only on substitutable components."}}

Consistently, we find a negative relationship between market-level measures of climate news and one-year-ahead firm-level accounting comparability. This finding is robust to several sensitivity checks. This relationship is mediated by the intensity with which firms apply accounting standards to transform economic events into accounting numbers and moderated by the extent to which firms are exposed to climate risks and by firms’ environmental performance. Our study contributes to the growing literature examining the negative effect of climate change on firm values and to the literature examining the determinants of accounting comparability. The practical implication of our study is that market participants should be cautious when comparing peer firms after periods of increased climate news.</p>"}}

However, new evidence from various social surveys indicates that union density has been rising in Japan. Using one of these social surveys  the Survey on the Work and Life of Workers (SWLW)  we show union density has risen by 7.3 percentage points to 29.1% in the Japanese private sector between 2011/13 and 2020/24. We decompose the growth in union density since 2011/13 to establish how much of it is attributable to changes in workforce composition. Conditioning on union presence at the workplace, compositional change accounts for 47% of the increase in union density. The remaining 53% is due to within-group change with unions increasing membership across all types of worker including some with traditionally low rates of unionization. However, establishing a union at the workplace remains key since virtually all the growth in union membership (97%) is in unionized workplaces."}}

This paper explores how these regulations shift the role of stablecoins from speculative tools to regulated financial instruments, opening the door for broader adoption and U.S. leadership in Web3 finance. It highlights real-world crypto use in inflation-hit countries, then outlines key infrastructure priorities across stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Drawing on examples from BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and emerging token standards, the paper proposes a path to modernize U.S. capital markets through blockchain. Clear regulation is the foundation—but real-world implementation is the next step. With the right infrastructure, tokenization could strengthen dollar dominance and make digital finance accessible to more people, not just professional traders."}}

The note unpacks how relevant product and geographic markets are defined, using factors such as consumer preferences, product substitutability, pricing, and end-usage, among other factors. To make these ideas concrete, it examines landmark cases where the CCI carefully demarcated markets to evaluate dominance and abuse. It also explains the recent inclusion of supply-side substitution in market definition post the 2023 Amendment. The discussion illustrates how identifying the relevant market is the first crucial step in competition analysis, as it establishes the boundaries for assessing power and potential competitive harm. By blending statutory interpretation with actual cases, this paper offers an accessible guide to a foundational concept in Indian competition law."}}

Drawing on sociotechnical, computer science, and digital government literatures, it traces interoperability's conceptual genealogy to reveal an underlying politics that prioritizes harmony over discord and consistency over plurality. This politics, the article argues, is in tension with the distinct role of statutory law (as opposed to regulation) in a democratic society. Legislation is not simply a technology through which one achieves the smooth operation of governance. Rather, legislation is better understood as a \"boundary object\": an information system through which members of different communities make sense of, and communicate about, complex phenomena. This sense-making includes and even requires disagreement, the managing and resolution of which is a vital function of both law and indeed of any information system."}}
