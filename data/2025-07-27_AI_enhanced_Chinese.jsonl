We employ robust multi-stage dimensionality reduction and modeling approaches, including Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for initial extraction, feature engineering, and consolidation of climate risk signals; t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for further, non-linear dimension reduction; and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to integrate market response variables, and develop dedicated, ad-hoc CRIs specifically tailored for fossil fuels and ESG investments. We also develop a \"super-CRI\" by applying a meta-combination technique, the Wavelets Ensemble (METS 3.0), to synthesize diverse climate risk indicators into one comprehensive measure.

However, in recent years, accidents of progressive collapse of roof structures have occurred frequently, and the corrosion problem of structures during long-term service is one of the main causes of such accidents. This paper takes the K8-type spherical latticed shell as the research object, considers the time-varying effect of corrosion, simulates corrosion by reducing the section thickness, and uses the alternative load path method to carry out numerical simulation on the collapse process of the latticed shell. The verified numerical simulation method is used to carry out the parametric analysis of the anti-progressive collapse performance of the corroded latticed shell. The results show that the anti-progressive collapse performance of the latticed shell decreases with the increase of service time, and shows the law of first decreasing and then tending to be stable with the increase of the corrosion area. The position of the initial failure node, the geometric size of the latticed shell and the form of load distribution all have significant effects on the degradation degree of the anti-collapse performance of the latticed shell. On this basis, the data set of the deep feedforward neural network is generated, and the intelligent evaluation model of the anti-progressive collapse performance of the corroded latticed shell is established, which can accurately and efficiently predict the anti-progressive collapse performance of the corroded latticed shell."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86K8\u578b\u7403\u9762\u7f51\u58f3\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u8150\u8680\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u6297\u8fde\u7eed\u5012\u584c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8150\u8680\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "research_question": "\u8150\u8680\u5bf9K8\u578b\u7403\u9762\u7f51\u58f3\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6297\u8fde\u7eed\u5012\u584c\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u5c4b\u9876\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5012\u584c\u4e8b\u6545\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u8150\u8680\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8150\u8680\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u622a\u9762\u539a\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c0f\u6a21\u62df\u8150\u8680\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u66ff\u4ee3\u8377\u8f7d\u8def\u5f84\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8150\u8680\u5bf9\u7f51\u58f3\u6297\u8fde\u7eed\u5012\u584c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6df1\u5ea6\u524d\u9988\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u7f51\u58f3\u7684\u6297\u8fde\u7eed\u5012\u584c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8150\u8680\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u5148\u4e0b\u964d\u540e\u8d8b\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u521d\u59cb\u5931\u6548\u8282\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u8377\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8150\u8680\u5bf9\u7f51\u58f3\u6297\u8fde\u7eed\u5012\u584c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u8150\u8680\u7f51\u58f3\u7684\u6297\u8fde\u7eed\u5012\u584c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Accurate prediction of strain demand is essential for ensuring pipeline safety and supporting geohazard risk assessment. A recently developed finite difference method (FDM)-based framework for pipeline strain analysis has demonstrated strong potential as a fast and practical tool. However, the current framework relies on a bilinear stress\u2013strain assumption, which allows closed-form expressions for axial force and bending moment in the governing equations. With more general nonlinear hardening models, such expressions are no longer available, and internal forces must instead be evaluated through numerical integration. This leads to a substantial increase in computational cost. To address this limitation, this study proposes a neural network\u2013enhanced finite difference method (NN-FDM). This approach augments the original FDM by incorporating neural network surrogate models that replace numerical integration for internal force evaluation, thereby enabling the inclusion of general nonlinear hardening behavior within the finite difference framework. Two case studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method under both bilinear and nonlinear hardening conditions. Results demonstrate that NN-FDM achieves high accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency in the presence of nonlinear hardening behavior. The proposed method provides a simple and general framework for evaluating pipeline strain demand across a wide range of constitutive models and shows strong potential as an efficient tool for rapid assessment and pre-screening applications in geohazard-prone areas."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff08NN-FDM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u5730\u8d28\u707e\u5bb3\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5730\u8d28\u707e\u5bb3\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6c38\u4e45\u5730\u9762\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u9700\u6c42\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff08FDM\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u5e94\u529b-\u5e94\u53d8\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u786c\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u786c\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff08NN-FDM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u529b\u3002", "findings": "NN-FDM\u5728\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u786c\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u786c\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5730\u8d28\u707e\u5bb3\u9891\u53d1\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u5e94\u53d8\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\u3002"}}

The new security scheme leads to reduced communication delays, which makes it suitable for application in automation networks. This scheme has been called event-based cryptography, where an event is defined as any change in the binary signals transmitted in the network. Although encryption can prevent an attacker from understanding which events have been transmitted, it is not sufficient to ensure system confidentiality. This is due to the fact that, in some cases, the pattern of event occurrences can be used to distinguish events or even identifying which event has occurred. This type of attack is called traffic analysis attack. In this paper, we propose the use of a padding mechanism together with the event-based cryptography, to prevent intruders from performing traffic analysis attacks. The event-padding mechanism inserts encrypted fake events to mascarade the time pattern of the system. A feasibility analysis of the proposed security scheme in a real application example is presented."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u586b\u5145\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u586b\u5145\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u52a0\u5bc6\u53ef\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u586b\u5145\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u586b\u5145\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ee5\u63a9\u76d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u586b\u5145\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u586b\u5145\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

This study provides novel direct evidence of the existence of such costs and causally identifies their consequences for price discovery. Our unique empirical setting is the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s 2016 adoption of a more secure data communication protocol for its online repository of corporate disclosures. During the first year of implementation, some users failed to adapt to the new protocol, which prevented them from accessing electronic filings and disrupted the processing of company disclosures. We show that these technological frictions reduced price informativeness for firms publishing new reports, consistent with the idea that higher information acquisition costs diverted resources necessary for interpreting the filings. Supporting this mechanism, we demonstrate that transition costs also undermined informed trading activity. We further explore heterogeneity and find that the negative impact of technological barriers is less pronounced when users were more sophisticated, when firms concurrently announced earnings, and when reports were less complex. Our results highlight that technological transition frictions are a first-order\u00a0 concern for policymakers and underscore the critical need to manage them within regulatory frameworks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u578b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u6469\u64e6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4ef7\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u77e5\u60c5\u4ea4\u6613\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "research_question": "\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u578b\u6210\u672c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u578b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u53d1\u73b0\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7f8e\u56fd\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a2016\u5e74\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5b9e\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u6469\u64e6\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u6280\u672f\u6469\u64e6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4ef7\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u77e5\u60c5\u4ea4\u6613\u6d3b\u52a8\uff1b\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u6210\u719f\u3001\u516c\u53f8\u53d1\u5e03\u76c8\u5229\u62a5\u544a\u6216\u62a5\u544a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u578b\u6210\u672c\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u9700\u91cd\u89c6\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u578b\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u52a0\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

This study assesses the economic viability and equity implications of deploying hybrid energy systems combining solar, wind and biomass in Cameroon&apos;s urban neighbourhoods. Using a discounted cash flow approach and net present value (NPV) as the main indicator, the research simulates several scenarios influenced by self consumption rates, government subsidies, and investment costs. The results show that PV-based RECs become profitable from 30% self-consumption, with NPVs ranging from \u20ac4100/kW in low-support scenarios to more than \u20ac10,000/kW in high-support conditions. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) has been estimated at between \u20ac102 and \u20ac125/MWh, confirming a strong competitiveness compared to regional grid tariffs.The study also introduces two innovative benefit-sharing models. One incentivizes virtuous energy behavior through competitive exchange pricing (PDM3), while the other prioritizes energy equity by allocating greater benefits to lower-income households (PDM4). Both models reduce disparities between prosumers and enable inclusive participation without sacrificing financial returns. Additionally, the inclusion of non-producing consumers in RECs highlights the potential for broader social integration, although it necessitates careful regulation to avoid benefit dilution."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5580\u9ea6\u9686\u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u3001\u98ce\u80fd\u548c\u751f\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5149\u4f0f\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684REC\u5728\u81ea\u7528\u738730%\u65f6\u76c8\u5229\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5580\u9ea6\u9686\u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6df7\u5408\u793e\u533a\uff08RECs\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u97e7\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4e2d\u975e\u5730\u533a\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d34\u73b0\u73b0\u91d1\u6d41\u6cd5\u548c\u51c0\u73b0\u503c\uff08NPV\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u666f\uff08\u81ea\u7528\u7387\u3001\u653f\u5e9c\u8865\u8d34\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u6210\u672c\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u5149\u4f0fREC\u5728\u81ea\u7528\u738730%\u65f6\u76c8\u5229\uff0cNPV\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a\u20ac4100/kW\u81f3\u20ac10000/kW\uff1bLCOE\u4e3a\u20ac102-125/MWh\uff0c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff08PDM3\u548cPDM4\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86REC\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

This study constructs an operational optimization model to plan a cost-minimizing pipeline network for the entire CCUS process, from capture and transportation to storage. It incorporates diverse storage sites, including depleted oil and gas fields, un-mineable coal seams, and deep saline aquifers, and evaluates the spatial matching and economic feasibility of CCUS deployment under two scenarios: annual CO2 reductions of 1.062 billion tons and 1.439 billion tons. The results show that the 1.062 billion ton scenario requires 552 pipelines spanning 22,168 kilometers, while the 1.439 billion ton scenario needs 611 pipelines covering 23,795 kilometers, primarily concentrated in Northwest, North, and Northeast China. Source-sink combinations involving modern coal chemicals and depleted oilfields exhibit superior economic performance, making them ideal for prioritized full-process demonstrations. Key regions for demonstration projects include Hami (Xinjiang), Yulin (Shaanxi), Changji (Xinjiang), Daqing (Heilongjiang), and Yinchuan (Ningxia), which offer abundant emission sources, favorable storage conditions, and short transportation distances. This study provides critical insights for national CCUS planning, recommending large-scale demonstrations in advantageous regions to achieve cost reductions and industry chain development through policy support, technological innovation, and industrial collaboration, thereby supporting China\u2019s carbon neutrality goal."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u56fdCCUS\u6280\u672f\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7ba1\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdCO2\u51cf\u6392\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5148\u793a\u8303\u533a\u57df\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u89c4\u5212\u4e00\u4e2a\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f4e\u7684CCUS\u7ba1\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56fd\u9ad8\u78b3\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u51cf\u6392\u9700\u6c42\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u78b3\u4e2d\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u9700\u52a0\u901fCCUS\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ad8\u78b3\u884c\u4e1a\u51cf\u6392\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "CCUS\u6280\u672f\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cdCO2\u51cf\u6392\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002", "findings": "1.062\u4ebf\u5428\u51cf\u6392\u60c5\u666f\u9700552\u6761\u7ba1\u9053\uff0822,168\u516c\u91cc\uff09\uff0c1.439\u4ebf\u5428\u60c5\u666f\u9700611\u6761\u7ba1\u9053\uff0823,795\u516c\u91cc\uff09\uff1b\u73b0\u4ee3\u7164\u5316\u5de5\u4e0e\u67af\u7aed\u6cb9\u7530\u7ec4\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CCUS\u7ba1\u9053\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea7CCUS\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u4f18\u5148\u793a\u8303\u533a\u57df\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In order to improve the energy efficiency, carbon efficiency and economy of the steel process system, this paper establishes an optimization model for the integrated energy system (IES) of an iron and steel industrial park considering multifunctional hydrogen production and carbon capture equipment, starting from the steel production system and the energy system, and with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the system and maximizing the energy utilization rate. Five cases were set up for comparative analysis and solved using the -constraint method. The optimization results show that the iron and steel production process is optimized by introducing hydrogen production from electricity and by-product gas in the iron and steel industrial park. Compared with the unoptimized system, after considering the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and the stepped carbon trading mechanism, the energy utilization rate is increased by 17.36%, the carbon emission of the park is reduced by 12504.36 t, and the total cost of the system is reduced by 12.31%, while meeting the demand of the energy load of the park. The experimental results show that the proposed model effectively improves the energy utilization while ensuring the reduction of economic cost, and the synergistic optimization of carbon capture and hydrogen energy system further reduces the carbon emission.

Among renewable energy technologies, Photovoltaic-Thermal (PVT) systems offer a promising solution by simultaneously generating electricity and thermal energy. Their integrations with Battery Energy Storage (BES), Thermal Energy Storage (TES), and Demand Response (DR) programs enhance the economic viability of such systems and the sustainability of manufacturing activities. This paper develops an optimization framework that combines bilevel and robust optimization to jointly optimize system configuration and operational scheduling for a PVT-BES-TES system in manufacturing facilities, considering weather uncertainties that influence PVT generation. The bilevel optimization model is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, while the robust optimization approach employs polyhedral uncertainty sets with bounded intervals for solar irradiance and ambient temperature, ensuring solution feasibility under worst-case scenarios. A case study on a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility was conducted to evaluate the economic and environmental benefits of integrating a PVT-BES-TES system under the DR program. Compared to the baseline scenario without PVT and DR integration, the proposed configuration achieves a 26.08% reduction in total annualized costs and a 14.35% decrease in total CO2 emissions. These findings underscore the economic and environmental advantages of PVT adoption in industrial settings under DR programs, demonstrating its potential to enhance energy flexibility and support sustainable manufacturing."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u5c42\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5236\u9020\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u7684PVT-BES-TES\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8003\u8651\u5929\u6c14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316PVT-BES-TES\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5236\u9020\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u662f\u5168\u7403\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\u6392\u653e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5316\u77f3\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5236\u9020\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\uff08MINLP\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u5236\u9020\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u4e0e\u672a\u6574\u5408PVT\u548cDR\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u60c5\u666f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8626.08%\u7684\u603b\u5e74\u5316\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u548c14.35%\u7684\u603bCO2\u6392\u653e\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u5c42\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86PVT-BES-TES\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5236\u9020\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Though traditional hydrodynamic models offer strong physical interpretability, they face significant limitations in parameter acquisition and adaptability to complex hydraulic conditions. Conversely, deep learning-based prediction methods exhibit robust generalization capabilities, but suffer from limited interpretability, particularly concerning the simultaneous modeling of hydrological delays and Markovian properties. Furthermore, these methods struggle to elucidate the intrinsic relationship between human-regulated control operations and hydraulic responses. To address above challenges, this study proposes PANet (Physics- and Action-informed water prediction Network), a multi-step water level prediction model. PANet innovatively integrates Integral Delay (ID) theory as its underlying physical mechanism with action-informed structures, enabling the simultaneous modeling of hydrological delays, Markovian properties, and the causal relationship between operational interventions and hydraulic responses. Specifically, it comprises two key components: the Action Attention Encoder (A2E) and the Dual-branch Decoder (DBD).
