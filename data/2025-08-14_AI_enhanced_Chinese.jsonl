As digital transformation accelerates globally, businesses in developing economies are increasingly turning to ML technologies to optimize their marketing efforts, enhance customer engagement, and improve operational efficiencies. By leveraging the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this study systematically reviewed a total of 45 peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2024. The findings reveal that ML-driven marketing strategies have significantly transformed customer engagement through personalized content, predictive analytics, and automated customer service, leading to improved conversion rates and cost efficiencies. However, the study also highlights key challenges, such as data quality, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory hurdles, which constrain ML adoption in these regions. Notably, while larger enterprises have made strides in integrating ML into their marketing processes, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) continue to face barriers related to limited resources and data accessibility. This review underscores the importance of addressing these challenges to fully leverage ML's potential in emerging markets, emphasizing the need for robust data management, privacy compliance, and strategic investments in technology. The study contributes to the existing body of literature by offering insights into the current state of ML adoption in marketing, identifying opportunities, and outlining practical implications for businesses seeking to enhance their marketing capabilities in rapidly evolving digital environments.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u5728\u8425\u9500\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ML\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "research_question": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u8425\u9500\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5168\u7403\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u91c7\u7528ML\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8ePRISMA\u6307\u5357\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf92018\u5e74\u81f32024\u5e74\u95f4\u53d1\u8868\u768445\u7bc7\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6587\u7ae0\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "findings": "ML\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8425\u9500\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86ML\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u8425\u9500\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6587\u732e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u91c7\u7528ML\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6295\u8d44\u3002"}}

This is a relatively new and understudied phenomenon whose societal relevance stems from its tendency to undermine support for redistribution and efforts to reduce inequality. To date, RRA has only been demonstrated using redistributive games, where a confounding variable arises because transfers that invert the ranking impose greater relative harm on the donating party than non-inverting transfers. We conducted two incentivized pre-registered experiments with Argentine participants who could express RRA in a distributive game that avoided the mentioned confounding variable. In addition, with the goal of assessing RRA in the broader context of other distributive motives, we assessed this preference when confronted against favoring equity or reducing inequality, the two most studied principles in the distributive justice literature. The results provide the first evidence of RRA in Argentina and in a distributive game. In general, RRA was weaker than the motivation to reduce inequality, which was in turn weaker than the preference for favoring merit. We also found that RRA correlated with subjective socio-economic status, as those who perceived themselves to be better off were more likely to avoid reverting recipients\u2019 rankings. These findings help establish the robustness of RRA and define some of its boundary conditions. We conclude by discussing our results in the context of previous studies of RRA, the literature on distributive preferences, and people\u2019s use of diverse fairness principles."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u201c\u6392\u540d\u9006\u8f6c\u538c\u6076\u201d\uff08RRA\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u4e0d\u613f\u9006\u8f6c\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u6392\u540d\u7684\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u963f\u6839\u5ef7\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u914d\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "research_question": "\u6392\u540d\u9006\u8f6c\u538c\u6076\uff08RRA\uff09\u662f\u5426\u5728\u907f\u514d\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u914d\u52a8\u673a\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff09\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1f", "motivation": "RRA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5174\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u5bf9\u518d\u5206\u914d\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u914d\u6b63\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u548cRRA\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9879\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u6fc0\u52b1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u963f\u6839\u5ef7\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u907f\u514d\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "findings": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u963f\u6839\u5ef7\u548c\u5206\u914d\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1RRA\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1bRRA\u5f31\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u8005\u53c8\u5f31\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u529f\u7ee9\uff1bRRA\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1RRA\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u5e76\u754c\u5b9a\u5176\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u914d\u504f\u597d\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u539f\u5219\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We find that depletion aversion is robust to different account types and is observed in accounts with real value. We consider why depletion aversion may arise, and we identify responsibility as a key mechanism underlying the effect: People find depleting accounts irresponsible, even when depletion is not financially costly.

Employing a Bayesian MCMC framework and the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), we assess the goodness-of-fit and statistical parsimony of each framework. Our results reveal a decisive preference for the constrained Stab model. It is selected as the best model for a majority of the sample (56.1\\%) and, critically, also achieves the best median goodness-of-fit, with $\\chi^2_{\\text{red}} = 0.88$. In contrast, the standard NFW framework is preferred in only 20.5\\% of cases, while the Freeman disk and MOND models are selected as optimal for just 14.0\\% and 9.4\\%, respectively.

We compared SL with Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning (BARL) agents as well as with its parent algorithm, SI. Using a biologically inspired seasonal foraging task in which resources shift probabilistically over a 10\u00d710 grid, we designed experiments that forced agents to balance probabilistic reward harvesting against information gathering. In early trials, where rapid learning is vital, SL agents survive, on average, 8.2 % longer than SI and 35% longer than Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning. While both SL and SI showed equal convergence performance, SL reached this convergence 40% faster than SI. Additionally, SL showed robust out-performance of other algorithms in altered environment configurations.

What conversational design features increase consumer engagement, and what trade-offs do they pose for marketers? We combine a large-scale behavioral audit with four preregistered experiments to identify and test a conversational dark pattern we call emotional manipulation: affect-laden messages that surface precisely when a user signals \u201cgoodbye.\u201d Analyzing 1,200 real farewells across the six most-downloaded companion apps, we find that 43% deploy one of six recurring tactics (e.g., guilt appeals, fear-of-missing-out hooks, metaphorical restraint). Experiments with 3,300 nationally representative U.S. adults replicate these tactics in controlled chats, showing that manipulative farewells boost post-goodbye engagement by up to 14\u00d7. Mediation tests reveal two distinct engines\u2014reactance-based anger and curiosity\u2014rather than enjoyment. A final experiment demonstrates the managerial tension: the same tactics that extend usage also elevate perceived manipulation, churn intent, negative word-of-mouth, and perceived legal liability, with coercive or needy language generating steepest penalties.

While indoor temperature is a powerful and controllable element of the retail environment, the pathways through which it shapes consumer behavior remain underexamined. Prior research has often assumed that simply cooling or warming a store helps consumers thermoregulate. Yet, thermoregulation is an individual, dynamic process that depends on whether a consumer feels discomfort, engages in regulatory action, and achieves relief. In this paper, we review and reframe existing work on temperature and consumer behavior, highlighting both what has been learned and what has been overlooked. We clarify the distinction between environmental temperature strategies and actual thermoregulatory processes, and we show how this distinction influences study design, interpretation, and practical implications. Building on this foundation, we propose a consumer journey framework that identifies specific stages where thermoregulation may occur, how it might be measured, and when retailers can effectively intervene. This framework opens new avenues for research on temperature as a strategic design element and thermoregulation as a physiological and psychological mechanism. Together, these contributions provide a roadmap for understanding how, when, and for whom temperature-based interventions support sustainable, consumer-centric retail experiences."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u65c5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "research_question": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u9884\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u5e97\u5185\u6e29\u5ea6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8c03\u8282\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u65c5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "findings": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u65c5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u65c5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u4ee5\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

While it is widely acknowledged that human oversight of AI play an important role in mitigating the technology's risks, research on the organisational embedding of human oversight is only emerging. Drawing on socio-legal theory, AI ethics, and business ethics, this article seeks to make three contributions. First, it conceptualises human oversight of AI as a novel task for human labour in AI governance, induced by legal regulation and distinct from market-driven roles such as AI Ethicists. Second, the article presents human oversight as an instance of a \"juridification\" of AI governance, potentially resulting in a crowding out of AI Ethicists and their ethical expertise and motivation by lawyers from key roles in AI governance. The normative implications of juridification could be significant, as there is some but not complete overlap between the normative interests protected by ethics and law. Third, the article examines how organisations may manage the ethical decision-making that persists within legally mandated oversight, comparing compliance-and integrity-based approaches. While the former provides organisations with more top-down control and are thus more likely to be adopted, the latter may be more preserving of workers' ethical motivations and offers potential for theoretical integration with the concept of 'trustworthy AI'.

By comparing Hayek's ideas with those of James Buchanan and Amartya Sen, the paper proposes complementary perspectives on the nature and defence of liberty. While Hayek emphasised the rule of law and spontaneous order, Buchanan advocated for constitutional constraints to protect individual autonomy, and Sen highlighted the expansion of human capabilities as a measure of freedom.

As these non-horizontal mergers have become more common, there is increasing interest in evaluating both potential efficiencies such as eliminating double marginalization and potential anticompetitive effects such as foreclosure and recapture. The mergers we study-hospital acquisitions of physician practices-have reshaped the $1 trillion US physician industry, nearly doubling the share of physicians working for hospitals between 2008 and 2016. We combine novel data and machine learning algorithms to identify a large number of integration events, spanning a wide range of markets with different competitive circumstances. We merge the integration events with claims data from a large national insurer to study their effects on prices. Focusing on childbirths, the most ubiquitous admission among the privately insured, we find that, on average, these mergers led to price increases for hospitals and physicians of 3.3% and 15.1%, respectively, with no discernible effects on quality measures. Using demand estimation to characterize substitution patterns for both physicians and hospitals, we construct tests that demonstrate price increases are larger among transactions with greater scope for foreclosure and recapture. Our estimates suggest that the costs of these mergers of hospitals and physicians have been substantial, and our mechanism tests offer guidance in predicting where the anticompetitive effects of non-horizontal mergers are likely to be strongest."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u4f01\u4e1a\u5408\u5e76\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u533b\u9662\u6536\u8d2d\u533b\u751f\u8bca\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u533b\u9662\u548c\u533b\u751f\u4ef7\u683c\u5206\u522b\u4e0a\u6da83.3%\u548c15.1%\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e92\u8865\u4f01\u4e1a\u5408\u5e76\uff08\u5982\u533b\u9662\u6536\u8d2d\u533b\u751f\u8bca\u6240\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff1f", "motivation": "\u975e\u6a2a\u5411\u5408\u5e76\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u6548\u7387\uff08\u5982\u6d88\u9664\u53cc\u91cd\u8fb9\u9645\u5316\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5982\u5c01\u9501\u548c\u518d\u6355\u83b7\uff09\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53cc\u91cd\u8fb9\u9645\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5c01\u9501\u548c\u518d\u6355\u83b7\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5927\u91cf\u6574\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u56fd\u5bb6\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7d22\u8d54\u6570\u636e\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u683c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u5408\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u533b\u9662\u548c\u533b\u751f\u4ef7\u683c\u5206\u522b\u4e0a\u6da83.3%\u548c15.1%\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5c01\u9501\u548c\u518d\u6355\u83b7\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u975e\u6a2a\u5411\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u975e\u6a2a\u5411\u5408\u5e76\u6f5c\u5728\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In this study, the effects of different growing media and irrigation volumes on seedling development were investigated, revealing that tomato seedlings grown with a medium porosity of 0.56 and an irrigation volume of 80\u201390% of the medium porosity showed optimal quality. Then, to optimize the irrigation strategy for tomato seedlings, a warning model was developed using seedlings at various developmental stages (one-leaf-one-apex (I), two-leaf-one-apex (II), and three-leaf-one-apex (III)). This model integrates environmental parameters with seedling water consumption to trigger warnings when substrate moisture levels drop to those that could cause wilting. Furthermore, greenhouse validation results showed that the predicted water consumption at each stage matched the actual water use. The model can guide the creation of an automated irrigation control system during seedling growth, establish standardized production methods, and reduce labor costs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u756a\u8304\u5e7c\u82d7\u683d\u57f9\u4e2d\u751f\u957f\u4ecb\u8d28\u548c\u704c\u6e89\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5e7c\u82d7\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b54\u9699\u5ea6\u4e3a0.56\u7684\u4ecb\u8d28\u548c80-90%\u5b54\u9699\u5ea6\u7684\u704c\u6e89\u91cf\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u5e7c\u82d7\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9884\u8b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u704c\u6e89\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u957f\u4ecb\u8d28\u548c\u704c\u6e89\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u756a\u8304\u5e7c\u82d7\u7684\u751f\u957f\u8d28\u91cf\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u704c\u6e89\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e7c\u82d7\u8d28\u91cf\uff1f", "motivation": "\u756a\u8304\u5e7c\u82d7\u7684\u751f\u957f\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u704c\u6e89\u7b56\u7565\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u957f\u4ecb\u8d28\u5b54\u9699\u5ea6\u548c\u704c\u6e89\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7c\u82d7\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6c34\u5206\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u4ecb\u8d28\u548c\u704c\u6e89\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9884\u8b66\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u5b54\u9699\u5ea60.56\u7684\u4ecb\u8d28\u548c80-90%\u704c\u6e89\u91cf\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u9884\u8b66\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6c34\u5206\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6c34\u5206\u9700\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5e7c\u82d7\u704c\u6e89\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u704c\u6e89\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u3002"}}

The impact was more significant for firms with lower external governance, higher industry competition, and lower information opacity. Additional tests reveal that online voting expands pay gaps within executive teams, relaxes constraints, and enables international executive recruitment.

In recent years, the economic and strategic case for the idea, rebranded as capital markets union in 2014 and included in a broader concept of savings and investments union in 2024, has strengthened. But progress towards that goal has been embarrassingly modest. This working paper argues that supervisory integration-the pooling of capital market supervision at the EU level-is the only realistic option to create a foundation for the successful development of competitive capital markets on a European scale. This could be achieved through a radical transformation of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) into a single, independent, and authoritative European supervisor. ESMA would gradually take over the jobs currently done by national capital market and audit supervisors and would replace them with its own network of national offices in EU countries. This consolidation would undercut the current incentives for market fragmentation, competitive distortion, and supervisory arbitrage, while respecting the European Union's multiplicity of financial centers, diverse market environments, and differentiated national social models. It would also represent a major simplification of the current arcane decision-making processes, allowing the European Union to move closer to the vision of a single jurisdiction for capital markets."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u76d1\u7ba1\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6b27\u76df\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5c06\u6b27\u6d32\u8bc1\u5238\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40\uff08ESMA\uff09\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6743\u5a01\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6b27\u6d32\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7ba1\u6574\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b27\u6d32\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6b27\u76df\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u8054\u76df\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5e74\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdb\u5c55\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5206\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e02\u573a\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u626d\u66f2\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7ba1\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ESMA\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6743\u5a01\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u63a5\u7ba1\u5404\u56fd\u76d1\u7ba1\u804c\u80fd\u3002", "findings": "\u76d1\u7ba1\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5e02\u573a\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5957\u5229\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c0a\u91cd\u6b27\u76df\u91d1\u878d\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u6574\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u7edf\u4e00\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6b27\u76df\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u8054\u76df\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6539\u9769\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Using stated preference data from 303 receiver firms and establishments, the model incorporates latent variables (Trust, Power, Infrastructure, and Insecurity) to assess their influence on delivery time decisions. Scenario-based simulations, derived from the estimated behavioral model, assess the impact of financial and non-financial incentives on the probability of OHD adoption. By capturing interaction dynamics among logistics stakeholders, the study provides insights into policy design for sustainable urban freight systems.

Although hot forming is driven by the coupling of energy and material flow, existing evaluation methods mainly focus on energy flow while overlooking the crucial role of material flow in determining energy flow direction, improving energy transmission efficiency. Therefore, a data-driven method for comprehensive energy efficiency and material utilization rate evaluation of aerospace hot forming is proposed. First, multi-level models for material utilization and energy consumption are established by analyzing the coupling between material flow and energy flow. Then, comprehensive evaluation coefficients are defined at the equipment, product, and factory levels, covering material utilization rate, energy efficiency, and energy consumption standards. Finally, an integrated private cloud-edge computing and data-driven comprehensive evaluation system is developed and deployed in a certain aerospace hot forging factory for practical validation.

Look-ahead power dispatch (LAPD) formulates a robust generation dispatch strategy by rolling modifying the day-ahead dispatch schedule for next few hours. However, limited by the computational complexity of LAPD model with uncertain chance constraints, traditional mathematical optimization methods struggle to balance solution efficiency and effectiveness. In response, based on the idea of model-data interactive driven approach, this paper proposes a risk-averse safe reinforcement learning (SRL) method. On the basis of LAPD mathematic model, the influenceof chance constraints on power grid operation boundary is characterized.

The method aims to optimize the simultaneous dynamic reconfiguration and allocation of Distributed Generation (DG) units and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). A novel financial index is defined, incorporating operational costs, unreliability, energy purchase expenses, and switching event costs, with the additional consideration of minimizing CO\u2082, SO\u2082, and NO\u2093 emissions. The optimization problem is formulated dynamically, accounting for time-varying load demand and renewable energy generation, providing a more accurate representation of operational conditions compared to static methods. Simulation results for the typical 16-bus, IEEE 33-bus, and IEEE 69-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of LBPOA in reducing operational costs, improving voltage quality, and reducing pollutant emissions. Specifically, LBPOA achieved a 39.06% reduction in power loss in the 16-bus system, a 36.63% reduction in the IEEE 33-bus system, and a 34.49% reduction in the IEEE 69-bus system. Furthermore, it improved the minimum voltage by 5.88%, 5.48%, and 4.21%, respectively. The method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, including Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-objective Harris Hawk Optimization (MOHHO), Multi-objective Cuckoo Search Algorithm (MOCSA), Multi-objective Ant Lion Optimizer (MOALO), Multi-objective Flower Pollination Algorithm (MOFPA), Multi-objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO), and Multi-objective Bat Algorithm (MOBAT), in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. These results confirm LBPOA&apos;s robustness, efficiency, and potential for large-scale deployment in real-world ADN applications."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLycaenid Brood Parasitism Optimization Algorithm (LBPOA)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e3b\u52a8\u914d\u7535\u7f51(ADN)\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d1\u7535(DG)\u5355\u5143\u4e0e\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf(BESS)\u7684\u5206\u914d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6392\u653e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0cLBPOA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7535\u538b\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6392\u653e\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u914d\u7535\u7f51(ADN)\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d1\u7535(DG)\u5355\u5143\u53ca\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf(BESS)\u7684\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u538b\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6392\u653e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u53d1\u7535\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eLycaenid Brood Parasitism Optimization Algorithm (LBPOA)\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLBPOA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316ADN\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd0\u884c\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6392\u653e\u3002", "findings": "LBPOA\u572816-bus\u3001IEEE 33-bus\u548cIEEE 69-bus\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8639.06%\u300136.63%\u548c34.49%\u7684\u529f\u7387\u635f\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7535\u538b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5LBPOA\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "practical_contributions": "LBPOA\u5728\u5b9e\u9645ADN\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u538b\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Through a qualitative multi-case analysis of four recent M&A transactions across telecommunications, banking, and oil sectors, we identify four distinct cultural integration approaches: minimal integration, attempted blending, imposed culture, and strong cultural blending. Our findings extend Nahavandi and Malekzadeh&apos;s (1988) acculturation model to emerging market contexts, revealing how sector-specific characteristics, regulatory environments, and power dynamics shape cultural integration outcomes. The research also contributes to theory by bridging the Resource-Based View as well as Cultural Web theories, demonstrating how organizational culture functions as a strategic resource requiring specific preservation strategies.

Sobol global sensitivity analysis was then employed to quantify the influence of energy consumption parameters\u2014and their interactions\u2014on total vehicle fuel consumption. To overcome high-dimensional optimization barriers, we designed a Collaborative Coevolution Particle Swarm Optimization (CCPSO) algorithm, integrating uniform experimental design and parallel optimization within the Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) foundation. The CCPSO-enabled strategy was benchmarked against conventional CPSO and Uniform Design CPSO (UD-CPSO) methods.

We find that higher top-down amplification of economic growth targets significantly increases corporate greenwashing engagement through reduced financial input to environmental protection and lax government environmental regulation. This effect is more pronounced when firms are seeking green financing, are non-SOEs, face high target constraints, or operate during stable periods of government five-year plans. However, this weakens when firms face intensive environmental regulation or receive more government subsidies.

This study provides a detailed analysis of load shifting strategies and their impacts on cost savings and grid load. The TES unit is integrated with the HP system via a secondary loop, allowing cooling energy to be stored in phase change material (PCM) and heat transfer fluid (HTF) within the TES unit. The stored energy can later be discharged to provide cooling to the building, decoupling cooling generation from demand and enabling flexible operation. A field study is conducted to compare the TES-HP system with the nonTES-HP system, demonstrating the benefits of integrating TES. An evaluation matrix is proposed, including instantaneous performance, load-shifting performance, accumulated performance, unit-value indexes from both building and equipment perspectives, and peak-hour-only indexes, to comprehensively assess and compare the performance of the TES-HP and non-TES-HP systems. A rule-based control strategy, which considers variations in electricity prices and ambient temperature, is implemented to stabilize building thermal comfort, increase TES charging efficiency, and achieve load shifting. To further supplement the field study, simulation models are developed to analyze the impact of TES cooling storage capacity and heat transfer capability (UA, between the HTF and PCM in the TES unit) on load-shifting performance. Field test results indicate that, with the same thermostat setting, the TES-HP system can achieve hourly grid load reductions of 92%, 58%, and 36% during each peak hour, respectively, and a 39% reduction in 24-hour electricity costs compared to the non-TES-HP system. Isolating the effects of different cooling loads, TES-HP can increase cooling capacity per cost (QpC) by 6.6 times during the first peak hour and by 27% over the entire 24-hour field study period. Simulation results indicate that doubling the storage capacity of TES can reduce hourly cost and power consumption by up to 84.8% during peak hours and reduce 24-hour electricity costs by 38% compared with the original TES unit design. Increasing UA by 10 times can lead to a more than 25% reduction in 24-hour electricity costs, owing to improved system efficiency. In summary, field experiments and simulation studies demonstrate the strong potential of TES-HP systems to enhance energy flexibility and cost efficiency in grid-interactive buildings, making them a promising solution for energy management."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u70ed\u80fd\u5b58\u50a8\uff08TES\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7535\u7f51\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u70ed\u6cf5\uff08HP\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f6c\u79fb\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u7f51\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5efa\u7b51\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86TES-HP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u70ed\u80fd\u5b58\u50a8\uff08TES\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u7f51\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u70ed\u6cf5\uff08HP\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f6c\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7535\u7f51\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5efa\u7b51\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0cTES-HP\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u7f51\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u80fd\u5b58\u50a8\uff08TES\uff09\u548c\u70ed\u6cf5\uff08HP\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u53d8\u6750\u6599\uff08PCM\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u70ed\u6d41\u4f53\uff08HTF\uff09\u7684\u50a8\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83TES-HP\u4e0e\u975eTES-HP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f6c\u79fb\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "findings": "TES-HP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5cf0\u503c\u65f6\u6bb5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1192%\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c24\u5c0f\u65f6\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e39%\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u4f20\u70ed\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TES-HP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u7f51\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5efa\u7b51\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "TES-HP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The method aims to optimize the simultaneous dynamic reconfiguration and allocation of Distributed Generation (DG) units and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). A novel financial index is defined, incorporating operational costs, unreliability, energy purchase expenses, and switching event costs, with the additional consideration of minimizing CO\u2082, SO\u2082, and NO\u2093 emissions. The optimization problem is formulated dynamically, accounting for time-varying load demand and renewable energy generation, providing a more accurate representation of operational conditions compared to static methods. Simulation results for the typical 16-bus, IEEE 33-bus, and IEEE 69-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of LBPOA in reducing operational costs, improving voltage quality, and reducing pollutant emissions. Specifically, LBPOA achieved a 39.06% reduction in power loss in the 16-bus system, a 36.63% reduction in the IEEE 33-bus system, and a 34.49% reduction in the IEEE 69-bus system. Furthermore, it improved the minimum voltage by 5.88%, 5.48%, and 4.21%, respectively.

Using survey data from 117 Hungarian family businesses, firms were classified into three levels of internationalization\u2014non-international, exporters, and firms operating through own foreign subsidiaries. Results reveal a statistically significant inverse relationship between internationalization depth and the \u201cFamily Influence and Control\u201d dimension, indicating that strong control preferences may constrain deeper international market engagement. A marginally significant difference emerges in \u201cEmotional Attachment,\u201d while \u201cFamily Business Identity,\u201d \u201cBinding Social Ties,\u201d and \u201cTransgenerational Succession Intent\u201d remain stable regardless of internationalization level. Cluster analysis identifies four distinct SEW profiles\u2014Family-Dominated, Strong Control, Weak Control, and Market-Oriented\u2014each showing unique patterns of international involvement.Theoretically, the study advances family business research by (1) refining the understanding of how individual SEW dimensions differentially relate to the depth of internationalization, challenging the prevailing assumption that SEW uniformly constrains cross-border expansion; (2) extending the application of the FIBER framework to capture nuanced patterns across varying internationalization pathways; and (3) highlighting the persistent resilience of certain non-economic goals, such as identity and succession intent, even under higher degrees of international exposure.For practicing leaders, a key takeaway is the importance of consciously managing control. Delegating the leadership of international expansion\u2014particularly to a well-trained family member\u2014can preserve socioemotional value while, if successful, positioning that family member as a strong successor candidate in the succession process. Future research could integrate geographic, industry-specific, and longitudinal perspectives, and extend the analysis to other Central and Eastern European countries."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f01\u4e1a\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e94\u79cd\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u8d22\u5bcc\uff08SEW\uff09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u201c\u5bb6\u65cf\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u201d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5448\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9SEW\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55FIBER\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u975e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u4e0e\u5bb6\u65cf\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f01\u4e1a\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u8d22\u5bcc\uff08SEW\uff09\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u8d22\u5bcc\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8eSEW\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u8d22\u5bcc\uff08SEW\uff09\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fFIBER\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5bb6\u65cf\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u4f9d\u604b\u3001\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f01\u4e1a\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ebd\u5e26\u3001\u8de8\u4ee3\u4f20\u627f\u610f\u56fe\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528117\u5bb6\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0eSEW\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u201c\u5bb6\u65cf\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u201d\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cdSEW\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "1. \u63ed\u793aSEW\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\uff1b2. \u6269\u5c55FIBER\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1b3. \u5f3a\u8c03\u975e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5bb6\u65cf\u4f01\u4e1a\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u59d4\u6d3e\u5bb6\u65cf\u6210\u5458\u9886\u5bfc\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u4f20\u627f\u3002"}}

On this account, and if all goes according to plan, courts will now be freed to limit agencies' statutory powers and thereby tame or deconstruct the administrative state. Yet developments in the law often have unintended consequences, and it may be that Loper Bright's rejection of deference will not inexorably move administrative law and regulatory policy in a less protective direction. This article shows that, taken to its logical implications, the formalistic theory of interpretation that the Loper Bright majority espoused compels greater scrutiny of all forms of agency error, including errors that involve the agency failing to regulate as much or as stringently as the best reading of statutes requires. More systematically, this would entail revisiting several areas of administrative law doctrine that put a thumb on the scale in favor of deferential review of agency inaction. As they currently stand, these standards of review are incompatible with Loper Bright's theory of interpretation. This article identifies these implications, argues that an asymmetrical approach to different types of errors that agencies might commit is undesirable for administrative law, and urges litigants and judges to begin the hard work of unpacking and faithfully pursuing Loper Bright's full implications, which may often involve a boon to those who government fails by doing less than Congress required."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u63a8\u7ffbChevron deference\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u5236\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6743\u529b\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u673a\u6784\u4e0d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002", "research_question": "\u63a8\u7ffbChevron deference\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d1\u7ba1\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u653e\u677e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aLoper Bright\u6848\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u610f\u5916\u540e\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u6784\u9519\u8bef\u5ba1\u67e5\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u6f14\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8Loper Bright\u6848\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u63a8\u7ffbChevron deference\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u673a\u6784\u4e0d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u653e\u677e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u77db\u76fe\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bc9\u8bbc\u5f53\u4e8b\u4eba\u548c\u6cd5\u5b98\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9Loper Bright\u6848\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Our analysis showed the hidden costs that many people pass over are, in fact, critical for the outcome of the project. It was found that due to poor economic management, a fraction of an expense would reduce economic stability. Moreover, in addition to this economic resiliency, the problem of poorly managed project management arises, where under-managed projects will constantly add to delays and thus cause an upsurge in expenses. The unexpected results came from trying to improve the handling of administrative tasks within the project; these tiny tweaks led to a 15% enhancement in project performance, which was surprising.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), being less affected by terrain and environmental conditions, can provide various emergency communication services in disaster-affected areas. This paper proposes a cyber-physical cooperative restoration strategy for DS based on UAV relay communications. To ensure the accessibility of communication links, a multi-UAV relay system channel transmission rate model is constructed. Aiming to maximize load restoration while minimizing UAV flight distances, the model comprehensively considers UAV operation and communication recovery constraints, load restoration constraints, and cyber-physical coupling constraints, and incorporates time sequence considerations to establish an integrated cooperative restoration model. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. An embedded constraint method based on deep neural networks (DNNs) is adopted to transform it into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. Furthermore, to accelerate the solution process, an L1-norm-based unstructured network pruning technique is designed to further improve the computational efficiency of the optimization problem embedded within DNNs. The results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative restoration strategy can fully exploit the restoration potential of the UAV relay system and enhance DS resilience."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u534f\u540c\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u540e\u901a\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u635f\u574f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u529f\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u6548\u7387\u548c\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u540e\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u9ad8\u6548\u6062\u590d\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u529f\u80fd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u540e\u901a\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u635f\u574f\u5bfc\u81f4\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u529f\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56e0\u5176\u4e0d\u53d7\u5730\u5f62\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e94\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u534f\u540c\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MINLP\uff09\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNN\uff09\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u4e8c\u9636\u9525\u89c4\u5212\uff08MISOCP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1L1\u8303\u6570\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u52a0\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u534f\u540c\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u540e\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u5feb\u901f\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e94\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7535\u529b\u6062\u590d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing energy consumption forecasting approaches, which typically rely on single algorithms, often fall short in predictive accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose a high-precision forecasting and operational optimization framework that integrates multi-model ensemble learning with intelligent dispatch optimization. By leveraging HYSYS process simulations and distributed control system (DCS) operational data, we systematically analyze the key drivers of energy consumption across critical equipment, including low-temperature submersible pumps, high-pressure pumps, seawater pumps, and boil-off gas (BOG) compressors. We construct a stacked ensemble prediction model, optimized using Optuna, by incorporating multiple machine learning algorithms as base learners. Building upon this, we design a hybrid simulated annealing-particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) algorithm enhanced with adaptive parameter tuning strategies, which enables global optimization of equipment start-stop combinations and operational parameters. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves prediction accuracy, achieving an overall R\u00b2 exceeding 0.95. Under three representative gas delivery scenarios (800, 1230, and 1450 m\u00b3/h), the optimization strategy reduces total system energy consumption by 3.7%, 4.8%, and 6.2%, respectively. Furthermore, across the full operational flow range, the method consistently reduces energy use by 2.76% to 6.20%, underscoring its strong engineering applicability and potential for broader deployment."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LNG\u63a5\u6536\u7ad9\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8LNG\u63a5\u6536\u7ad9\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff08SA-PSO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528HYSYS\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u62df\u548cDCS\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5806\u53e0\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408SA-PSO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bR\u00b2\u8d85\u8fc70.95\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u8f93\u6c14\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u80173.7%\u30014.8%\u548c6.2%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLNG\u63a5\u6536\u7ad9\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5de5\u7a0b\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Consequently, regulators rely on spontaneous adverse event reporting systems (e.g., FAERS) to identify potential safety issues-termed safety signals-by detecting side effects that occur disproportionately among patients taking a particular drug. However, these observational data are subject to selection and reporting biases, which can lead to false signals or missed risks.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Methodology/results: We propose a Bayesian framework to enhance the hypothesis generation step in safety signaling, offering two methodological advances over standard approaches that rely solely on observational data. First, it integrates pre-approval clinical trial and post-approval observational data. Second, it uses information from common ADRs to estimate and correct bias in rare ADRs. We assess the approach using an analytical model and a large-scale numerical study with real clinical trial and FAERS data. Incorporating clinical trial data substantially reduces signaling costs, and using a common ADR for debiasing yields further gains. This refinement improves decisions for about 1% of ADRs, translating to expected cost savings of 1.5-2.3% (approx. $32-159 million), with performance robust to moderate parameter misspecification.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Managerial implications: By using existing regulatory data, our approach supports a more efficient and timely hypothesis generation process in post-approval surveillance.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u836f\u7269\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\uff08ADRs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u9057\u6f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u53ef\u8282\u77011.5-2.3%\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff08\u7ea63200\u4e07\u81f31.59\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u836f\u7269\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\uff08ADRs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u836f\u7269\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\uff08ADRs\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u6025\u8bca\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5047\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u9057\u6f0f\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u89c1ADRs\u6821\u6b63\u7f55\u89c1ADRs\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548cFAERS\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "findings": "\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u53f7\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u89c1ADRs\u6821\u6b63\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u8282\u77011.5-2.3%\u6210\u672c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u6821\u6b63\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u836f\u7269\u76d1\u7ba1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u8282\u7701\u6570\u5343\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

To achieve the research objectives, the study initially identifies and categorizes HWM-related activities, subsequently mapping the role of Industry 4.0 technologies in each category. The control activities within hospitals are classified into seven key domains: human resources, infrastructure and equipment, financial management, operations and processes, energy efficiency and waste reduction, information systems and technology, and biological risk control and safety. The study then introduces the Combinatorial-Interval CoCoSo method and demonstrates its practical applicability through two case studies involving eight hospitals, where hospitals are prioritized based on the identified control activities.

Through close analysis of a situated cooking task involving four international students, we examine how participants use laughter to negotiate the interpretation of an underspecified instruction and their roles during the task. Two excerpts from the early stages of the interaction are analyzed using Jeffersonian transcription and a sequential approach to laughter. The analysis reveals that laughter supports both the mitigation of face-threatening acts and the tacit redefinition of shared goals, without resorting to explicit deliberation. It mediates tensions between diverging intentions and helps participants realign around a common objective\u2014namely, collective enjoyment. Rather than functioning solely as a face-saving mechanism, laughter operates as a multi-level pragmatic resource: it enables conflict resolution, relational alignment, and the reframing of the normative structure of the activity. These findings expand current models of mitigation by showing how laughter contributes not only to local facework but also to broader discursive shifts in joint action. The study contributes to pragmatics by highlighting the role of laughter in reorganizing interactional norms in real time."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7b11\u58f0\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u9645\u7d27\u5f20\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u70f9\u996a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b11\u58f0\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5171\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "research_question": "\u7b11\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7ba1\u7406\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u9645\u7d27\u5f20\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b11\u58f0\u5728\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u7b11\u58f0\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Jeffersonian\u8f6c\u5f55\u6cd5\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u7b11\u58f0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56db\u540d\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u70f9\u996a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Jeffersonian\u8f6c\u5f55\u6cd5\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u7b11\u58f0\u3002", "findings": "\u7b11\u58f0\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5a01\u80c1\u9762\u5b50\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5171\u540c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7b11\u58f0\u5728\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u7b11\u58f0\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Traditional static dispatch strategies, such as deploying the nearest available unit, often lead to suboptimal resource allocation and coverage gaps during high-demand periods, especially when dealing with varying emergency call priorities and service requirements. Existing approaches largely focus on stationary demand models or rely on computationally intensive methods such as Markov decision processes that are impractical for large-scale systems. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a dynamic dispatch framework that adapts to real-time demand fluctuations and system states, offering a scalable solution to enhance EMS efficiency in time-varying environments with heterogeneous service types. We introduce two simple heuristic policies: a static policy derived from a deterministic linear program with buffer capacity and a dynamic policy that adjusts dispatch probabilities using real-time information. Both approaches explicitly account for multiple service classes with distinct response time requirements and resource consumption patterns. Theoretical analysis shows that these policies achieve asymptotic optimality gaps of O(\u03b8-1/2 log 1/2 \u03b8) and O(\u03b8-2/3 log \u03b8), respectively, where \u03b8 is a system size-scaling parameter. We further extend our framework to accommodate i) high-variance demand patterns that cannot be adequately represented by traditional Bernoulli processes, and ii) light traffic regime, and we show that all the results extend to these settings as well.

Clarifying the driving mechanisms behind ESs supply-demand relationships (ESSDR) and formulating sustainable management strategies accordingly are essential for achieving the supply-demand balance of ESs. Taking Qingdao as a case study, this research quantified six types of ESs\u2014food production, water yield, marine aquaculture, carbon sequestration, soil retention, and recreational capacity\u2014over the period from 2002 to 2022. On this basis, an innovative Geographical-XGBoost (G-XGBoost) model was employed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of influencing factors across different geographical units. This approach revealed the underlying driving mechanisms of ESSDR in coastal cities and informed the development of spatially targeted strategies for sustainable ESs management. The results indicate that: (1) The urban core and southern coastal areas are major deficit zones in Qingdao, while the northern agricultural areas and mountainous regions are surplus zones. (2) From 2002 to 2022, urban expansion emerged as the primary driving force of ESSDR in coastal cities. Significant spatial interactions exist between the built-up land proportion (BLP) and factors such as cultivated land proportion (CLP), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and distance to ports (DTP). When BLP exceeds 30%, the negative impacts of urban expansion are significantly intensified under conditions where CLP is below 40%, or PET exceeds 1000 mm, or DTP is less than 20 km. (3) The impact of these influencing factors on ESSDR differs across different geographical units. Accordingly, region-specific management strategies were proposed based on the dominant factors in each area. These findings provide both a technical framework and theoretical foundation for the precise formulation of ESs sustainable management strategies in coastal cities globally."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7G-XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9752\u5c9b2002-2022\u5e74\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u4f9b\u9700\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u57df\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "research_question": "\u6cbf\u6d77\u57ce\u5e02\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u4f9b\u9700\u5173\u7cfb\uff08ESSDR\uff09\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u5236\u5b9a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f9b\u9700\u5e73\u8861\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u4e0e\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6cbf\u6d77\u57ce\u5e02\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u4f9b\u9700\u5931\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u660e\u786e\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u5355\u5143\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408G-XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u63ed\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91cf\u5316\u516d\u7c7b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528G-XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "findings": "1. \u9752\u5c9b\u57ce\u5e02\u6838\u5fc3\u533a\u4e0e\u5357\u90e8\u6cbf\u6d77\u4e3a\u8d64\u5b57\u533a\uff0c\u5317\u90e8\u519c\u4e1a\u533a\u4e0e\u5c71\u533a\u4e3a\u76c8\u4f59\u533a\uff1b2. \u57ce\u5e02\u6269\u5f20\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e0e\u8015\u5730\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b3. \u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u6cbf\u6d77\u57ce\u5e02\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u51c6\u5236\u5b9a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7ba1\u7406\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Icing on vessel surfaces poses serious risks, including reduced stability that can lead to capsizing in the worst case. The International Maritime Organization (IMO)\u2019s Polar Code mandates that ship operators assess and mitigate icing risks during operational planning. However, the absence of specific route risk models or metrics hinders effective implementation of these regulations. This study introduces a route icing risk model to estimate the spatial-temporal icing risk of Arctic voyages, leveraging existing icing rate prediction models and weather forecasts. Using actual ship trip data and reanalysis weather data from 2021 to 2023, the study identifies severe icing thresholds for the estimation of severe icing events. Ten ship trips were analysed to compare route icing risk predictions based on forecast data versus reanalysis data, revealing significant discrepancies. The study also examines the effects of route discretization intervals, speed changes, and waypoint adjustments on route icing risk estimation. Results indicate that larger discretization intervals may underestimate risk, while waypoint deviations have a greater impact on icing risk than speed adjustments. Both factors have limited influence when arrival times are fixed comparing with arrival time not fixed.

We develop the Firm-level Accounting data-based Machine Learning (<i>FAML</i>) framework, which applies machine learning algorithms directly to firm-level corporate financial reports to nowcast aggregate economic output. Unlike \"aggregate-then-nowcast\" approaches, which average firm-level variables into market or sector aggregates, or \"factor-then-nowcast\" methods, which extract common factors via dynamic factor models, our&nbsp;<i>FAML</i>&nbsp;method operates on the full set of firm-level accounting variables, retaining the informational detail embedded in firm-level heterogeneity and cross-firm interactions while minimizing information loss. Empirically, the&nbsp;<i>FAML</i>&nbsp;framework reduces root mean squared error by over 70% relative to a random walk benchmark and consistently outperforms both aggregation- and factor-based methods. Variable importance analysis further shows that accounting data from the industrials, utilities, and consumer discretionary sectors are particularly informative for economic output nowcasting. These findings underscore the value of leveraging machine learning to transform micro-level accounting data into timely macroeconomic insights."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4ece\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FAML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d22\u52a1\u62a5\u544a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u673a\u5668\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u805a\u5408\u6216\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u800cFAML\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08FAML\uff09\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fdd\u7559\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u8d22\u52a1\u62a5\u544a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u805a\u5408\u6216\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "findings": "FAML\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u57fa\u51c6\u964d\u4f4e70%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5de5\u4e1a\u3001\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u522b\u6709\u7528\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We study the key determinants of LP profitability in a dynamic reduced-form model where an AMM operates in parallel with a centralized exchange (CEX), traders route their orders optimally to the venue offering the better price, and arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies. Using large-scale simulations and real market data, we analyze how LP profits vary with market conditions such as volatility and trading volume, and characterize the optimal AMM fee as a function of these conditions. We highlight the mechanisms driving these relationships through extensive comparative statics, and confirm the model's relevance through market data calibration. A key trade-off emerges: fees must be low enough to attract volume, yet high enough to earn sufficient revenues and mitigate arbitrage losses. We find that under normal market conditions, the optimal AMM fee is competitive with the trading cost on the CEX and remarkably stable, whereas in periods of very high volatility, a high fee protects passive LPs from severe losses.

Each questionnaire contained eleven demographic questions and five clinical vignettes. Three vignettes had one variable altered between two groups and two vignettes were identical in the two groups. Participants were physicians working in hospital wards admitting adult, somatic patients. Physicians were randomly assigned to one of the two groups and had to decide for a resuscitation in case of a cardiac arrest.Results: 303 out of 724 physicians (41.8%) from 18 wards responded. Physicians from surgery departments were significantly (p<0.001) more likely to resuscitate than those from the medicine department in four vignettes (multimorbidity, oncology, dementia and neurology vignettes). Physicians with an experience in ICU were significantly (p<0.05) less likely to recommend resuscitation in three vignettes (multimorbidity, oncology and dementia vignettes). Two patient variables were significantly (p<0.001) associated with a decision to resuscitate: patient being a physician themself vs. not (33.1% vs. 15.8%); patient of younger age vs. older (61.5% vs. 25.5%) despite a terminally ill condition. Participants overall were more likely to resuscitate in comparison with expert advice in four vignettes (multimorbidity, oncology, dementia and neurology vignettes).Conclusions: Physicians\u2019 own characteristics contribute to heterogeneity in decision-making. Physicians\u2019 resuscitation attitudes are influenced by patient factors that may not be related to resuscitation outcomes. These results raise important ethical considerations and highlight the need for specific training about resuscitation outcomes and reflexiveness in decision-making."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u5c0f\u63d2\u66f2\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u533b\u751f\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u533b\u751f\u590d\u82cf\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u533b\u751f\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u548c\u57f9\u8bad\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "research_question": "\u533b\u751f\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u533b\u751f\u5728\u5fc3\u810f\u9aa4\u505c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u82cf\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u533b\u751f\u590d\u82cf\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u533b\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5355\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u5c0f\u63d2\u66f2\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u62a5\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u5305\u542b11\u4e2a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u548c5\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5c0f\u63d2\u66f2\u3002", "findings": "\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u590d\u82cf\uff0c\u6709ICU\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u533b\u751f\u66f4\u5c11\u63a8\u8350\u590d\u82cf\uff1b\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u533b\u751f\u6216\u5e74\u8f7b\u60a3\u8005\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u590d\u82cf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u533b\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u590d\u82cf\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u57f9\u8bad\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Collaborative training of polarized images can effectively integrate multi-source data and enhance the generalization ability and performance of models. However, due to the fact that these data are usually distributed across multiple devices and have high privacy sensitivity, such as distributed devices or terminals equipped with polarized cameras, direct central training may face the risk of data leakage and insufficient privacy protection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a polarization image enhancement method based on federated learning to effectively safeguard data privacy. To optimize the model aggregation in the federated learning framework, a loss-weighted aggregation strategy is designed, combining multi-source information from each client to construct a global model for distributed low-light image enhancement. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly reduces training time but also outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of privacy protection.To ensure reproducibility, the source code and demonstration videos can be found at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dzWMZgnGYl92uyabAkfhXQ (Extraction code: zs6h)."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how and why economics students use AI chatbots, and to better understand if AI chatbot usage prevents students from learning.

We find that 1) the majority of students use AI chatbots to help them learn, 2) the majority of students know how to use AI appropriately, and, 3) students\u2019 fear that AI will produce inaccurate information and their desire to learn are the primary deterrents to using AI chatbots inappropriately.

Tasked with decisions that profoundly affect children and families, CPWs must remain accountable for their actions. This accountability requirement can heighten vulnerability, contributing to stress and compassion fatigue. Despite its central role in CP practice, accountability remains poorly defined in the scientific literature, with limited insight into its impact on CPWs&apos; daily work.ObjectiveThis study examines Quebec CPWs\u2019 experience of accountability by exploring (1) how they define it, (2) its impact on their personal and professional lives, and (3) the strategies they use to cope with it.Participants and SettingData for this study were drawn from a larger investigation on workplace psychological health involving 310 CPWs in the Greater Montreal area. This analysis focuses on a subsample of 30 CPWs.MethodsThis exploratory qualitative study relies on a thematic analysis of anonymized transcripts of telephone interviews.ResultsParticipants defined accountability as a combination of professional, organizational, legal, and medical responsibilities inherent to CP work. Most reported negative effects, including stress, anxiety, reduced sense of competence, and work overload. Clinical support from colleagues and supervisors emerged as the most effective coping strategy.ConclusionsThis study reveals accountability as a complex, dynamic, and systemic experience for Quebec CPWs, significantly shaping their practice and well-being.

To address this issue, we intend to examine the effects of mobile app\u2019s service quality dimension on e-customer satisfaction, subsequently on e-customer loyalty drawing upon both the SERVQUAL and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) frameworks. To evaluate their effects, the responses (n=605) were collected from the mobile apps\u2019 users for instant home delivery services using a questionnaire survey. The data were analyzed by the AMOS v-24 and PROCESS Macro v-4.20 software through the lens of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results reveal that visual organization of the mobile apps, reliability, responsiveness, user-friendliness, and personal need fulfilment are the crucial predictors of e-customer satisfaction, which also can be turned into the e-customer loyalty. Furthermore, the study examines the mediating role of e-customer satisfaction in the proposed relationships. Our research contributes to the validation and extension of the SERVQUAL and TAM frameworks, offering practical implications for scholars and policymakers involved in managing mobile app-based instant home delivery services.

It is based on community knowledge, lived experience of emergency events and readiness to contribute towards their own resilience with the help of external organisations.\u00a0This paper explores community-led resilience models through the case study of the Australian Red Cross Community-Led Resilience Teams (CRT) program in regional New South Wales in Australia. Drawing on qualitative empirical data from the evaluation of the program in 2024, we analyse the strengths of community-led resilience efforts including their ability to enhance trust, social cohesion, and responsiveness to local needs. We also critically examine key challenges, such as sustaining long-term engagement, navigating resource limitations, and ensuring inclusivity, particularly in reaching marginalised groups.\u00a0Our research shows that the success of community-led resilience is predicated on four essential factors: It requires for the community to be motivated to get involved; it is based on capacity and leadership within the community to manage emerging structures for resilience building; the timing for resilience-building needs to be right; and external services must be available to support the community in their efforts.\u00a0This paper contributes to the broader conceptual understanding of how communities can be supported and empowered to drive their own resilience-building strategies. We offer insights for policymakers and practitioners on fostering sustainable, scalable, and inclusive community resilience, emphasising the role of community leadership in shaping disaster preparedness and response."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u65b0\u5357\u5a01\u5c14\u58eb\u5dde\u7ea2\u5341\u5b57\u4f1a\u793e\u533a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u97e7\u6027\u56e2\u961f\uff08CRT\uff09\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u97e7\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u793e\u533a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u97e7\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u9886\u5bfc\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u707e\u5bb3\u51c6\u5907\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u707e\u5bb3\u98ce\u9669\u51cf\u5c11\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u9010\u6e10\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4ecd\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u793e\u533a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u97e7\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672c\u5730\u9886\u5bfc\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u67902024\u5e74CRT\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u793e\u533a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56db\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u672c\u5730\u9886\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65f6\u673a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u652f\u6301\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u9886\u5bfc\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u51c6\u5907\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u793e\u533a\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the software development process away from traditional areas such as design or technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration.

This study explores the pivotal role of top leadership in driving digital transformation in emerging markets, a strategic frontier for digital and AI growth where top-down strategy prevails. Focusing on China, a key arena for digital advancement, we conceptualize digital leadership as a multi-dimensional, trait-based capability shaped by personal and professional attributes. Analyzing over 4,000 Chinese A-share listed firms (2016-2021), our mixed-method approach investigates not only whether chairmen lead digital transformation, but also what determines their capacity to do so. We identify key chairperson traits-technical background, R&amp;D experience, and long-term orientation-as predictors of digital strategy emphasis and talent acquisition. Clustering reveals four leadership archetypes: technocrats, practitioners, agents, and grassroots leaders, with varying impacts on transformation outcomes. Technocrats and practitioners show better digital leadership, with technocrats excelling in private firms and mature governance systems, while agents play a larger role in SOEs under institutional constraints. To reinforce the link between chairman characteristics and digital transformation, we exploit staggered digital government reforms as a quasi-exogenous shock and identify a causal effect between the political embeddedness of chairmen and enhanced digital transformation. The study is among the first to study how digital leadership-shaped by individual traits and institutional alignment-addresses transformation challenges in emerging markets. Our findings highlight how leadership shapes organizational digital growth."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5c42\u9886\u5bfc\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2d\u56fdA\u80a1\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u8463\u4e8b\u957f\u7279\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u7814\u53d1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5bfc\u5411\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u9886\u5bfc\u539f\u578b\u3002", "research_question": "\u9ad8\u5c42\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u662f\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u589e\u957f\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u52a8\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6570\u5b57\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u88ab\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7279\u8d28\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d7\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5c5e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e862016-2021\u5e74\u95f44000\u591a\u5bb6\u4e2d\u56fdA\u80a1\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u653f\u5e9c\u6539\u9769\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51c6\u5916\u751f\u51b2\u51fb\u3002", "findings": "\u8463\u4e8b\u957f\u7279\u8d28\uff08\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u7814\u53d1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u957f\u671f\u5bfc\u5411\uff09\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\uff1b\u56db\u79cd\u9886\u5bfc\u539f\u578b\uff08\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u548c\u8349\u6839\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\uff09\u5bf9\u8f6c\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u5b57\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4eba\u7279\u8d28\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u8f6c\u578b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u9009\u62d4\u548c\u57f9\u517b\u6570\u5b57\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5236\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

But new security and privacy concerns arise as a result of this change, and they must be carefully considered. This article explores the numerous privacy and security flaws, such as data breaches, illegal access, and compliance issues, that are inherent to databases hosted on the cloud. This article takes a look at the cloud from the user and provider points of view, and it discusses the main techniques and solutions that may be used to lessen the impact of these risks. The report argues for a multi-pronged strategy to protect sensitive data kept in the cloud, including strong encryption, access control methods, data governance frameworks, and user awareness training. In addition, the article delves into how regulations like GDPR and HIPAA affect database administration in the cloud.

It can swiftly deliver top-tier surgical expertise to any area within communication coverage, significantly enhancing the efficiency of medical services. In July 2025, the urology team at Fuzhou University Affiliated Provincial Hospital, a tertiary care institution, in collaboration with experts from Beijing and France, successfully performed the world's first remote robotic-assisted surgery over a network distance of 15,000 kilometers (9,400 kilometers in a straight line). Utilizing a 5G ultra-remote domestic surgical robot, they performed the resection and anastomosis of the upper segment of the left ureter. This groundbreaking procedure was live-streamed globally during the International Society of Robotic Surgery (SRS) Annual Meeting, marking it as the world's first cross-continental three-console robot-assisted 5G ultra-telesurgery. To establish a management system that aligns with the advancement of emerging medical technologies, this paper employs SWOT analysis to explore a comprehensive control model for telesurgery throughout all phases: before, during, and after the operation. The focus is on medical quality and safety while constructing a management framework centered on patient safety. This framework is supported by technological advancements and reinforced by systematic processes. Ultimately, this lays a solid foundation for the widespread application of telesurgery."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SWOT\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u652f\u6491\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u65b0\u5174\u533b\u7597\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u76f8\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u30015G\u7f51\u7edc\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u5957\u4ee5\u533b\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "SWOT\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3001\u52a3\u52bf\u3001\u673a\u4f1a\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SWOT\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u672f\u524d\u3001\u672f\u4e2d\u548c\u672f\u540e\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u652f\u6491\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

We adopt a mixed-methods approach with multiple data, consisting of documents, interviews and workshop material. Our findings indicate that social media enables means to support resilience strengthening mechanisms in disaster management in each temporal phase of disasters. Effective utilization of social media requires proactive strategic planning, stronger utilization of its potential for reciprocity, and recognizing it as a tool for learning and development. Social media can foster resilient disaster management by providing a platform for increasing awareness and motivation, facilitating proactive information gathering, supporting coordination and utilization of citizen knowledge, strengthening trust and the sense of security, and collecting feedback."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5728\u5404\u707e\u5bb3\u9636\u6bb5\u5747\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u97e7\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5229\u7528\u5176\u4e92\u60e0\u6f5c\u529b\u5e76\u89c6\u5176\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "research_question": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u707e\u5bb3\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u97e7\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u6863\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u6750\u6599\u3002", "findings": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5728\u5404\u707e\u5bb3\u9636\u6bb5\u5747\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u97e7\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5982\u63d0\u5347\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u516c\u6c11\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u3001\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e92\u60e0\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5229\u7528\u548c\u4e92\u60e0\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

This paper examines the textual structure of climaterelated financial disclosures in the European energy sector, focusing on their alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations on governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The analysis combines four layers: lexicometric diagnostics to assess readability and structure; AI-based BERT models to evaluate alignment; topic modeling to explore thematic organisation; and panel regressions to identify structural, financial, and cultural drivers. Results show that firms prioritize metrics and strategy over governance and risk management. Shorter, focused language improves alignment with risk disclosures, while lexical variety supports governance and strategy. Thematic analysis reveals fragmented climate narratives, suggesting limited maturity in integration. Regression results highlight that board gender diversity, ownership structure, ESG scores, EU taxonomy-aligned revenues, and cultural orientation are key drivers of TCFD alignment. These alignments are material, as each is significantly linked to firm valuation, indicating investors respond to depth and specificity of disclosures. Findings advance understanding of narrative climate disclosures and offer practical insights for assurance, benchmarking, and sustainability analysis. \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e1a\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u8d22\u52a1\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4e0eTCFD\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u6d32\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u8d22\u52a1\u62ab\u9732\u5982\u4f55\u4e0eTCFD\u5efa\u8bae\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6b27\u6d32\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u62a5\u544a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u62ab\u9732\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u6027\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5176\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eTCFD\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6218\u7565\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982BERT\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9762\u677f\u56de\u5f52\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u8ba1\u91cf\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eBERT\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9762\u677f\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6218\u7565\u800c\u975e\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u7b80\u6d01\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u98ce\u9669\u62ab\u9732\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u6218\u7565\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6c14\u5019\u53d9\u8ff0\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff1b\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7ed3\u6784\u3001ESG\u8bc4\u5206\u7b49\u662fTCFD\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u53d9\u4e8b\u6027\u6c14\u5019\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u62ab\u9732\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u6539\u8fdb\u62ab\u9732\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Our study encompasses various games and treatments that span a wide array of decision environments, including different (i) trade-offs (e.g., Pareto vs. non-Pareto dominated, socially efficient vs. inefficient), (ii) motives for non-selfish behavior (e.g., inequity aversion, reciprocity), (iii) costs associated with punishing and rewarding, (iv) incentives for belief accuracy, and (v) the number of allocations in a given game. Our findings reveal a consistent underestimation of rewards at both the aggregate and individual levels. This suggests that individuals harbor pessimistic perceptions or \"mental models\" regarding human rewarding behavior, regardless of the decision environment and incentives at play.

Conditioning on their beliefs about the future and their long-run forecasts reduces the pure partisan gap in inflation forecasts by two thirds. The gap between Democrats and Republicans is largest for partisans who are the most knowledgeable about politics.

Overall, our results suggest that mortgage lenders view the risk of SLR as a long term risk, and that attention and beliefs are potential barriers through which SLR risk is priced in residential mortgage markets."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8d37\u6b3e\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u9ad8\u6d77\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u623f\u4ea7\u6536\u53d6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6ea2\u4ef7\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u8d37\u6b3e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u8fdd\u7ea6\u6216\u4fe1\u7528\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u540e\u679c\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u6216\u6c14\u5019\u5426\u8ba4\u8005\u8f83\u591a\u65f6\uff0c\u6ea2\u4ef7\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "research_question": "\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u673a\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u6d77\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5230\u4f4f\u5b85\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u7387\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d77\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5730\u533a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u8d37\u6b3e\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6d77\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u623f\u4ea7\u6536\u53d6\u66f4\u9ad8\u5229\u7387\uff0c\u6ea2\u4ef7\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u5e02\u573a\u5173\u6ce8\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Identifying personality demands in job ads requires addressing challenges such as the prevalence of false positives. We demonstrate that as many as half of all instances of trait descriptive terms in job ads are false positives in the sense that they do not refer to workers&apos; personalities. The presence of false negatives is less problematic. After eliminating false positives, we validate that our measures capture employers&apos; demand for personality traits by showing that, at the occupation level, our measures are correlated with the traits of individuals in those occupations for all traits except emotional stability. In our sample of job ads, personality trait demands are as prevalent in ads as requirements for human capital such as education and work experience. Consistent with evidence on the importance of social skills in the labor market, extroversion is the trait most commonly sought by employers,\u00a0but a substantial\u00a0fraction of ads also indicate demand for conscientiousness,\u00a0openness, and agreeableness."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bcd\u7684\u96c7\u4e3b\u9700\u6c42\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u62db\u8058\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u9700\u6c42\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5916\u5411\u6027\u662f\u96c7\u4e3b\u6700\u5e38\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6027\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u8d28\u5982\u5c3d\u8d23\u6027\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u62db\u8058\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u96c7\u4e3b\u5bf9\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff1f", "motivation": "\u62db\u8058\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u9700\u6c42\u8bc6\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u5047\u9633\u6027\u548c\u5047\u9634\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e94\u5927\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5916\u5411\u6027\u3001\u5c3d\u8d23\u6027\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u3001\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u62db\u8058\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bcd\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u5047\u9633\u6027\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u804c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5916\u5411\u6027\u662f\u96c7\u4e3b\u6700\u5e38\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6027\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5c3d\u8d23\u6027\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u9700\u6c42\u5728\u62db\u8058\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9700\u6c42\u540c\u6837\u666e\u904d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u62db\u8058\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u9700\u6c42\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u96c7\u4e3b\u548c\u62db\u8058\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u5bf9\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u62db\u8058\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

This study investigates the economic impact of extreme weather events (EWEs) on business activity in New Zealand, with a focus on businesses in M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori communities. Using a novel combination of datasets, including up to 15 years of monthly business sales, meteorological data, demographic statistics, and ancestral geographic markers, we examine how extreme hot and cold temperature, rainfall, and wind events influence sales at the micro level, across over 2,000 statistical area units (SA2s). Extreme heat EWEs significantly reduce business sales, with an average monthly decline of 1.77% and an average annual loss per business unit of $US 23,390 (standard deviation $US 19,189). This eOect follows a non-linear, hump-shaped pattern, intensifying above 23\u00b0C. However, despite well documented socioeconomic disparities, M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori populations exhibit virtually identical business responses to EWEs after controlling for location and socioeconomic disparities. This reveals that Indigenous identification alone does not shape business vulnerability to climate-related disruptions. Our findings provide new insights into climate adaptation, Indigenous economic resilience, and sustainable development.

In response, the Future Made in Australia Act 2024 (FMIA) commits $22.7 billion to mission-driven investment in critical minerals, clean energy, sovereign manufacturing, and emerging technologies. The policy vision is strategically sound, but history shows that investment alone does not guarantee capability gains. Past initiatives have been slowed, diluted, or derailed by governance friction, structural, procedural, relational, and adaptive weaknesses that erode legitimacy, stall delivery, and limit long-term impact. Without reform, FMIA risks repeating the experience of underperforming programs such as the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, rather than replicating agile, trusted models like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Four governance frictions are most likely to undermine FMIA's ambitions: 1. Structural-Centralised decision-making that sidelines regional and sector-specific priorities. 2.

These results are particularly strong in companies lacking other corporate governance mechanisms. We also identify that creditors' monitoring serves as a channel for value creation by efficient investments in M&amp;As.

In our model, an excessive credit expansion in one country exacerbates the moral hazard problem in its interbank market, leading to a market collapse and subsequent capital flight. Such inflows into the second country have nonmonotonic effects on its economy. While raising total credit for production, capital inflows exacerbate credit misallocation by tightening endogenous borrowing constraints for high-productivity agents. Sufficiently large inflows may trigger a collapse in the recipient country&apos;s interbank market, leading to a discontinuous welfare loss. We show that optimal policy responses depend on the magnitude and composition (debt versus FDI) of capital inflows.\u00a0 In the dynamic model, we characterize various patterns of international financial risk contagion and endogenous boom-bust credit cycles in the global economy.

Daughters of victims are 59-88% more likely to experience emotional, physical or sexual IPV. Persistence is partly explained by the intergenerational transmission of attitudes: Daughters of victims have more accepting attitudes toward IPV and marry men who are also more accepting, both of which predict the incidence of IPV. This greater acceptance among daughters of victims reflects the mother-to-daughter transmission of attitudes to IPV.

Current studies have been carried out on these topics. In this article, the electricity exports of the mentioned countries between 2017-2023 are analyzed and empirical analyzes are made using the indices of trade balance, revealed comparative advantage, relative trade advantage, relative export advantage and relative import advantage. The data source used is the International Trade Center. The results of the research show that diversification in the energy sector and the development of renewable energy sources are of strategic importance for the mentioned countries. Increasing the production of electricity from green sources in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan creates the opportunity to access wider markets than the existing ones. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have a competitive advantage. The results show that increasing the production of green energy can strengthen the position of the countries in question in the regional and global markets and ensure the sustainability of electricity exports."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e862017-2023\u5e74\u95f4\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65af\u5766\u3001\u571f\u5e93\u66fc\u65af\u5766\u548c\u4e4c\u5179\u522b\u514b\u65af\u5766\u7684\u7535\u529b\u51fa\u53e3\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d38\u6613\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u52bf\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7eff\u8272\u80fd\u6e90\u751f\u4ea7\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fd\u5bb6\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u6218\u7565\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "research_question": "\u7eff\u8272\u80fd\u6e90\u751f\u4ea7\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65af\u5766\u3001\u571f\u5e93\u66fc\u65af\u5766\u548c\u4e4c\u5179\u522b\u514b\u65af\u5766\u7684\u7535\u529b\u51fa\u53e3\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7eff\u8272\u80fd\u6e90\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u6218\u7565\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d38\u6613\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u52bf\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u8d38\u6613\u4f18\u52bf\u6307\u6570\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8d38\u6613\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u52bf\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "findings": "\u4e4c\u5179\u522b\u514b\u65af\u5766\u548c\u571f\u5e93\u66fc\u65af\u5766\u5728\u7eff\u8272\u80fd\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7eff\u8272\u80fd\u6e90\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fd\u5bb6\u62d3\u5c55\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u7eff\u8272\u80fd\u6e90\u4e0e\u8d38\u6613\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7eff\u8272\u80fd\u6e90\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u51fa\u53e3\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Interestingly, this interaction transforms ESG into an insurance-like hedge, protecting returns as volatility increases. Notably, we identify a pivotal turning point at relatively low volatility levels. Below this threshold, ESG activities lack effectiveness, but when volatility surpasses it, their hedging power becomes pronounced. This effect intensifies as volatility rises, rewarding ESG leaders more significantly. Our sectoral and quantile analyses corroborate these findings.

This paper explores the hypothesis that greater technological rivalry has exacerbated adjustment costs, slowing reallocation. Using microdata at the US Census and estimates of technological rivalry in firm growth regressions, we find that technological rivalry slows firm responses to productivity shocks.

We show how these shocks contributed to a post-Covid feedback loop that intensified inflation. By linking weekly shocks to monthly inflation components up to the industry level, we find that global value chain disruptions generate the most persistent and broad-based price pressures, while energy and domestic supply shocks tend to produce more transitory effects, as their narrower inflationary impact is more easily offset by demand-dampening, contractionary forces.

We document key facts about the importance, distribution, and composition of collateral, including its presence, types, and values. On average, 70% of credit amounts are collateralized. Real estate and financial assets are the most pledged, while physical movable assets and other intangible assets are less present. In addition, we show that the aggregate collateral value pledged to the banking sector is substantial, driven mainly by real estate in most countries. For the first time, we examine the collateral channel in bank credit using the actual value of individual collateral. By exploiting within-firm and within-bank variations for newly issued secured loans, we find that the elasticity of collateral value to loan commitment amounts is around 0.7-0.8.

By incorporating the Gaussian mixture distribution, our approach effectively characterizes short-term fluctuations and non-traditional features of stock returns\u2014such as skewness and heavy tails\u2014that are often overlooked by traditional models. Compared to GARCH models and their variants, our method demonstrates superior performance in volatility estimation, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility. It provides more accurate volatility forecasts and offers unique risk insights for different assets, thereby deepening the understanding of return uncertainty. Additionally, we propose a novel use of Code embedding which utilizes a bag-of-words approach to train hidden representations of stock codes and transforms the uncertainty attributes of stocks into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors are subsequently reduced to two dimensions, allowing the observation of similarity among different stocks. This visualization facilitates the identification of asset clusters with similar risk profiles, offering valuable insights for portfolio management and risk mitigation. Since we predict the uncertainty of returns by estimating their latent distribution, it is challenging to evaluate the return distribution when the true distribution is unobservable. However, we can measure it through the CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score) to assess how well the predicted distribution matches the true returns, and through MSE (Mean Squared Error) and QLIKE (quasi-likelihood) metrics to evaluate the error between the volatility level of the predicted distribution and proxy measures of true volatility. The results highlight the robustness and predictive accuracy of our approach, suggesting that it significantly improves volatility forecasting and enhances the practical utility of risk modeling in financial markets. In summary, we assess return uncertainty at each timestep, performing extensive experiments across Chinese equities and measuring uncertainty similarities among stocks. With the Transformer-based model enhanced by stock ticker embeddings, our framework outputs the Gaussian mixture distribution to characterize the return uncertainty, offering a new approach to study return volatility."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u6355\u6349\u4e2d\u56fd\u80a1\u5e02\u8d44\u4ea7\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GARCH\uff09\u5728\u6355\u6349\u80a1\u7968\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u504f\u6001\u548c\u539a\u5c3e\uff09\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u80a1\u7968\u4ee3\u7801\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u80a1\u7968\u4ee3\u7801\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CRPS\u3001MSE\u548cQLIKE\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u6ce2\u52a8\u52a0\u5267\u65f6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u96c6\u7fa4\u3002"}}

In light of the foregoing, exploratory research was conducted through a case study and qualitative methods, based on interviews with 14 managers from the assistive and administrative areas of a hospital setting, working in tactical and strategic roles. In addition to the interview script, observations and document analysis were performed, aiming at data triangulation. The interviews were transcribed and coded using the Nvivo 12\u00ae software, and the used data analysis technique was discourse analysis. The results revealed that the hospital\u2019s performance indicators are used and configured to strengthen and reproduce power in the hospital, with the assistive area, through the quality sector, being the one that most denotes power in the field and is responsible for the indicators. Moreover, the use of performance indicators, such as the so-called black list and the loss list, is one of the greatest examples of control, domination, and reproduction of power concerning the activities of managers in the hospital. For this reason, they generate tension and concern among those responsible for filling out the indicators.

However, intermittent time series, characterized by sparse non-zero values, irregular zeros, and distinct individual patterns, pose unique challenges. Traditional time series analysis techniques and most deep neural networks struggle with zero-inflated data, often leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we propose the Zero-Inflated Deep AutoRegressive (ZIDAR) model to address these issues. Our model constructs a sophisticated representation architecture by combining recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), which captures temporal relationships in historical data and improves the representation of zeros by replacing them with weighted quantiles. We also introduce a novel loss function, the negative likelihood of a zero-inflated mixture of Gaussian densities, enabling balanced prediction of non-zero and zero values. In addition, two practical prediction methods are provided for intermittent time series. Experimental results demonstrate that the ZIDAR model outperforms existing methods, offering a more effective solution for intermittent time series forecasting and providing valuable insights for supply chain."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ZIDAR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RNN\u548cTCN\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f6\u503c\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u5982B2B\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u9500\u552e\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u96f6\u503c\u8fc7\u591a\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08RNN\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08TCN\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u81a8\u80c0\u6df1\u5ea6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08ZIDAR\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u66ff\u6362\u96f6\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u96f6\u81a8\u80c0\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u8d1f\u4f3c\u7136\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "ZIDAR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ZIDAR\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This understatement enables accurate prediction of further downgrades, with machine learning models achieving up to 75% accuracy. The findings have practical relevance for investors and risk managers seeking to anticipate formal rating actions before they occur."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u673a\u6784\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u201c\u5168\u5468\u671f\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u4e0b\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u964d\u7ea7\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u65f6\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u7ea7\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u5168\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u4e0b\u8c03\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u6027\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u65f6\u8bc4\u7ea7\u5728\u964d\u7ea7\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4f4e\u4f30\u53ca\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5168\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u4f7f\u752828,847\u4e2a\u5317\u7f8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e74\u5ea6\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e34\u65f6\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "findings": "\u4e34\u65f6\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f4e\u4f30\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u7ea7\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe75%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u65f6\u8bc4\u7ea7\u5728\u964d\u7ea7\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bc4\u7ea7\u884c\u52a8\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Yet very little has been documented about barriers to this important adaptation strategy. Exploiting temporal and spatial variation in drought, characterized by low precipitation levels, in India, I find drought reduces the share of agriculture labor hours by 3.6%. Reductions are driven by households not owning land. Motivated by these facts, I develop a model of labor allocation across agriculture and non-agriculture sectors to analyze how droughts influence structural transformation. Results suggest that projected increases in the spatial extent of droughts will induce landowning households to allocate more labor to agriculture due to cultural norms and limited markets for land whereas induce landless households to reduce their agricultural labor. The net effect is a 1% reduction in total agricultural labor supply. This implies that 2.5 million individuals will leave agriculture. I then use the model to run policy counterfactual regarding how projected climate change could influence the cost to the government of achieving its stated target of increasing the manufacturing share of GDP to 25% by 2035. Projected climate change would require the government to subsidize non-agriculture wages more relative to current status quo climate conditions due to the presence of land market frictions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e72\u65f1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5370\u5ea6\u519c\u6751\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u518d\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e72\u65f1\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u52b3\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65e0\u5730\u5bb6\u5ead\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5e72\u65f1\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u519c\u4e1a\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u51cf\u5c111%\uff0c\u7ea6250\u4e07\u4eba\u79bb\u5f00\u519c\u4e1a\u3002\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u8fd8\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u653f\u5e9c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5236\u9020\u4e1aGDP\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5e72\u65f1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u519c\u6751\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u518d\u5206\u914d\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u518d\u5206\u914d\u662f\u519c\u6751\u5bb6\u5ead\u9002\u5e94\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u969c\u788d\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u519c\u4e1a\u4e0e\u975e\u519c\u4e1a\u90e8\u95e8\u95f4\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5370\u5ea6\u5e72\u65f1\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u5e72\u65f1\u51cf\u5c11\u519c\u4e1a\u52b3\u52a8\u65f6\u95f43.6%\uff0c\u65e0\u5730\u5bb6\u5ead\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5e72\u65f1\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u519c\u4e1a\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u51cf\u5c111%\uff0c\u7ea6250\u4e07\u4eba\u79bb\u5f00\u519c\u4e1a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e72\u65f1\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u518d\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u571f\u5730\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u76ee\u6807\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

A production well and fluid model was developed using PIPESIM, incorporating pressurization via pumps, heaters, and insulation. Productivity analysis indicated that the highest output was achieved by combining pumps and heaters with insulation. The application of vacuum-insulated tubing (VIT), characterized by low thermal conductivity, increased production by approximately 2.3 times. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the productivity results to quantify the contribution of each production method. The analysis revealed that the pump had the most significant impact on productivity, accounting for 63.1% of the overall increase. These results suggest that insulation and heaters should be installed when the pump is applied, and that VIT with low thermal conductivity is particularly effective when heaters are employed. An economic evaluation was performed using the net present value (NPV) to determine the optimal operating conditions for the production well. The findings demonstrated that installing electric submersible pumps (ESP) is essential for economically viable production. When insulation, heaters, and pumps were used in combination, the maximum NPV was 2.7 times higher than that of a well equipped with a pump alone.

The findings reveal that while these spillovers significantly reduce the systemic risk at the level of individual listed banks, they concurrently elevate systemic risk across the broader financial system. The impact varies across product types: fixed-income WMPs, medium- or low-risk products, and open-ended structures are more likely to amplify such spillover effects. In contrast, financial contagion or general risk spillovers are not the primary drivers of these effects. Instead, wealth management subsidiaries, as peripheral nodes in the banking network, play a critical role in dispersing institutional risk. Moreover, net-value-based WMPs offer a transparent mechanism for identifying, measuring, and releasing underlying asset risk, thereby helping to mitigate systemic vulnerabilities in the banking sector. These findings offer important implications for improving the regulatory framework of the wealth management market and enhancing systemic risk prevention mechanisms."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e0a\u5e02\u94f6\u884c\u7406\u8d22\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u53d1\u884c\u7684\u7406\u8d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u805a\u71262022\u5e7411\u6708\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7834\u51c0\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7834\u51c0\u7406\u8d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u5bf9\u4e0a\u5e02\u94f6\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5355\u4e2a\u4e0a\u5e02\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4e2a\u91d1\u878d\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea7\u54c1\u7c7b\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u5404\u5f02\uff1a\u56fa\u6536\u7c7b\u3001\u4e2d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4ea7\u54c1\u66f4\u6613\u653e\u5927\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u91d1\u878d\u4f20\u67d3\u6216\u4e00\u822c\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u51fa\u5e76\u975e\u4e3b\u56e0\uff0c\u7406\u8d22\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u94f6\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u5916\u56f4\u8282\u70b9\u5728\u5206\u6563\u673a\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u51c0\u503c\u578b\u4ea7\u54c1\u901a\u8fc7\u900f\u660e\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u91ca\u653e\u5e95\u5c42\u8d44\u4ea7\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u94f6\u884c\u4f53\u7cfb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u7834\u51c0\u7406\u8d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0a\u5e02\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7406\u8d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u7834\u51c0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u4f53\u7cfb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7406\u8d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u98ce\u9669\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u5e02\u94f6\u884c\u7406\u8d22\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u7406\u8d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u67902022\u5e7411\u6708\u7834\u51c0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "findings": "\u7834\u51c0\u4ea7\u54c1\u964d\u4f4e\u5355\u4e2a\u94f6\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u91d1\u878d\u4f53\u7cfb\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u56fa\u6536\u7c7b\u3001\u4e2d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4ea7\u54c1\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff1b\u7406\u8d22\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6563\u8282\u70b9\uff1b\u51c0\u503c\u578b\u4ea7\u54c1\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7406\u8d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u7834\u51c0\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u8d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u9632\u8303\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

As expected, the success of previous film projects is the main determinant of hiring for a new film. However, we find that age matters, even though 99% of our directors are younger than 61. Age matters also for a sub-sample of directors younger than 50. We address endogeneity, consider different economic conditions, and verify that directors who dropped out of the sample did not retire.We also document that on average, only 12% of an entering cohort of new directors are women and they follow a different path than men in the entertainment industry. However, we do not find much evidence for gender bias for women who do become directors. We argue that if there is age bias in a highly visible industry, then there may be even more bias in industries with much less public scrutiny."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7535\u5f71\u5bfc\u6f14\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u7ba1\u7406\u804c\u4f4d\u62db\u8058\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u5bf9\u62db\u8058\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u5973\u6027\u5bfc\u6f14\u4e2d\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002", "research_question": "\u5e74\u9f84\u6216\u6027\u522b\u662f\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5f71\u5bfc\u6f14\u7684\u62db\u8058\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7535\u5f71\u5bfc\u6f14\u7ba1\u7406\u9ad8\u9884\u7b97\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5176\u62db\u8058\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u7ba1\u7406\u804c\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u804c\u4e1a\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u62db\u8058\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5bfc\u6f14\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u9879\u76ee\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u62db\u8058\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u5e74\u9f84\u5bf9\u62db\u8058\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5bfc\u6f14\u5e74\u9f84\u4f4e\u4e8e61\u5c81\uff1b\u5973\u6027\u5bfc\u6f14\u5360\u6bd4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e74\u9f84\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u9ad8\u66dd\u5149\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5176\u4ed6\u884c\u4e1a\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u62db\u8058\u4e2d\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Python, as a versatile programming language, has emerged as a powerful tool for data analytics due to its extensive libraries and user-friendly nature. This systematic literature review explores Python's role in streamlining data analytics by examining its applications across various stages of the data analysis process, including data collection, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. Key Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are discussed, highlighting their functionality in handling large datasets and enabling accurate and efficient analysis. Real-world examples demonstrate how Python can be applied in diverse sectors, from retail to healthcare, enhancing decision-making processes through data-driven insights. Furthermore, the limitations of Python, as well as alternative data analysis tools such as R and RapidMiner, are explored to provide a comprehensive view of Python's place in modern data analytics. The review concludes that while Python offers significant advantages in data analysis, a combination of tools may often be necessary to meet the complex demands of today's data-driven industries."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Python\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u6e05\u6d17\u3001\u5904\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7b49\u73af\u8282\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982R\u548cRapidMiner\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "research_question": "Python\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ee3\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0cPython\u56e0\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5e93\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5e93\uff08\u5982NumPy\u3001Pandas\u548cMatplotlib\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5206\u6790Python\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u6e05\u6d17\u3001\u5904\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "findings": "Python\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86Python\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5730\u4f4d\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86Python\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Este estudo teve como objetivo investigar e monitorar a varia\u00e7\u00e3o espa\u00e7o-temporal de um sistema de pastejo rotacionado utilizando sensores RGB a bordo de aeronaves remotamente pilotadas (APRs). O experimento foi conduzido em uma pastagem de Brachiaria decumbens no Nordeste do Brasil, com per\u00edodos de pastejo de 7 dias e per\u00edodos de descanso de 28 dias, taxa de lota\u00e7\u00e3o de 3,2 unidades animais por hectare e \u00e1rea total de 2500 m\u00b2 . Imagens obtidas de ve\u00edculos a\u00e9reos n\u00e3o tripulados (VANTs) foram empregadas e sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial dos animais monitorados pelo Sistema de Posicionamento Global (GPS) foi analisada. \u00cdndices de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o como o \u00cdndice Normalizado de Diferen\u00e7a Verde-Vermelho (NGRDI), \u00cdndice de Folhas Verdes (GLI) e \u00cdndice de Resist\u00eancia Atmosf\u00e9rica Vis\u00edvel (VARI) foram derivados de imagens de sensores RGB. O \u00edndice VARI exibiu uma faixa mais ampla de valores, variando entre 0,200 e -0,207. Fatores de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o e manejo influenciaram diretamente a correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre os \u00edndices de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o estudados e o \u00edndice de \u00e1rea foliar (IAF). Para avaliar a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da pastagem, o \u00edndice de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da pastagem (IDP) foi utilizado, revelando uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o de 97% na vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o entre o 1\u00ba e o 2\u00ba ciclos de pastejo, uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o de 14% ap\u00f3s o terceiro ciclo e uma recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de 1,2% ap\u00f3s o per\u00edodo de descanso.

A Dagum Gini coefficient is employed to assess spatial inequality and its sources from a static perspective. Kernel density estimation is applied to depict the dynamic distribution and convergence patterns. Additionally, a spatial Markov chain model is introduced to identify the locking effects of spatial disparities.The results are as follows:(1) Carbon emission intensity in the transportation industry shows a declining trend overall, but significant spatial imbalance persists across provinces. The Gini coefficient increased from 0.201 in 2005 to 0.204 in 2020, showing a fluctuating upward trend. The disparity between eastern and western regions is the primary contributor to interregional inequality, with an average Gini coefficient of 0.244. The transvariation density component contributes an average of 37.020%, representing the largest source of overall disparity.(2) A trend of convergence is observed at the national level and in the eastern and western regions, while the central region shifts from convergence to divergence. A gradient distribution structure emerges, with some provinces consistently exhibiting carbon emission intensities well above the national average.(3) Traditional Markov chain analysis reveals clear hierarchical solidification and a \"club convergence\" effect. The spatial Markov chain model further indicates that the state of neighboring regions significantly influences local transition probabilities, reinforcing the spatial lock-in effect of carbon emission intensity.These findings provide support for developing region-specific carbon reduction strategies to promote a green and low-carbon transformation of the transportation industry."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e862005\u81f32020\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e1a\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f14\u53d8\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Dagum\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u9759\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u53ca\u5176\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63cf\u7ed8\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9501\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u603b\u4f53\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u7701\u9645\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4e1c\u90e8\u4e0e\u897f\u90e8\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u4e3b\u56e0\uff1b\u5168\u56fd\u53ca\u4e1c\u897f\u90e8\u5448\u73b0\u6536\u655b\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e2d\u90e8\u7531\u6536\u655b\u8f6c\u5411\u53d1\u6563\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u5c42\u7ea7\u56fa\u5316\u548c\u201c\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u6536\u655b\u201d\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e1a\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f14\u53d8\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e1a\u7eff\u8272\u4f4e\u78b3\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Dagum\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u603b\u4f53\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4e1c\u90e8\u4e0e\u897f\u90e8\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u4e3b\u56e0\uff1b\u5168\u56fd\u53ca\u4e1c\u897f\u90e8\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e2d\u90e8\u53d1\u6563\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u5c42\u7ea7\u56fa\u5316\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9501\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u63ed\u793a\u9501\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e1a\u4f4e\u78b3\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

However, due to their deteriorating long-term performance, these recycled pavements may generate higher user costs and pollutant emissions in the operational phase. To comprehensively evaluate these impacts, this study conducted a life-cycle-based analysis of 20 pairs of recycled and conventional overlays based on the SPS-5 data. Statistical analysis indicated that the outcomes are significantly affected by overlay thickness and pretreatment. The life cycle cost of nearly all thin recycled overlays (51 mm) is more expensive than that of thin new overlays by 0.0415~9.41 MUSD/km. In contrast, for thick overlays (127 mm) with intensive pretreatment, 80% of recycled sections can become more cost-effective. Besides, most recycled sections demonstrate lower total carbon emissions compared to new sections, with this advantage being particularly pronounced also in the case of thick overlays and intensive pretreatment."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u518d\u751f\u6750\u6599\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6750\u6599\u5728\u9053\u8def\u8986\u76d6\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u518d\u751f\u6750\u6599\u5728\u9053\u8def\u8986\u76d6\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\uff1f", "motivation": "\u518d\u751f\u6750\u6599\u5728\u9053\u8def\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e2d\u7684\u518d\u5229\u7528\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u957f\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6392\u653e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSPS-5\u6570\u636e\u768420\u5bf9\u518d\u751f\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u8986\u76d6\u5c42\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u8584\u518d\u751f\u8986\u76d6\u5c42\uff0851\u6beb\u7c73\uff09\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8986\u76d6\u5c42\uff0c\u800c\u539a\u8986\u76d6\u5c42\uff08127\u6beb\u7c73\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0b80%\u7684\u518d\u751f\u8def\u6bb5\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff1b\u518d\u751f\u8def\u6bb5\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u666e\u904d\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u518d\u751f\u6750\u6599\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9053\u8def\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e2d\u518d\u751f\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u539a\u8986\u76d6\u5c42\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

As a result, highly accurate ultra - short - term forecasting of PV power generation has become extremely important. A hybrid method integrating rule - based and deep learning models is carried out in this study, with the DLinear model being used to break down time series into trend and remainder parts. After that, an LSTM model independently forecasts the outputs from the DLinear model, and then these forecasts are combined to create the DLinear - LSTM model, which is used to predict PV power generation at 5 - minute and 15 - minute intervals. At a PV power station, tests showed that the model could reach a daily average prediction accuracy of over 93%. The model shows great precision in prediction whether it is sunny or rainy. In the case of 5 - minute and 15 - minute forecasts, the model is good at seizing the trends of variation. The predicted curves are highly in line with the actual power generation patterns, showing little divergence and a high degree of correlation with the real output fluctuations. Despite the fact that cloudy weather brings more prediction difficulties because of its inherent uncertainties and thus has lower accuracy in comparison to sunny and rainy weather, the model is able to capture basic variation trends, which offers useful information for 15 - minute power generation forecasting."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DLinear-LSTM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u4f0f\u53d1\u7535\u7684\u8d85\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c5\u5206\u949f\u548c15\u5206\u949f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65e5\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc793%\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u5149\u4f0f\u53d1\u7535\u8d85\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5149\u4f0f\u53d1\u7535\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLinear\u548cLSTM\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DLinear\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3a\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u5269\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\uff0cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3aDLinear-LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u6a21\u578b\u57285\u5206\u949f\u548c15\u5206\u949f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u65e5\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc793%\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5929\u6c14\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u4f0f\u53d1\u7535\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5149\u4f0f\u53d1\u7535\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

This study investigates risk perceptions and management strategies among 403 Nile tilapia farmers operating in cage and pond systems across five counties bordering Lake Victoria, using a mixed-methods approach. Data was collected using a structured survey. The analysis combines descriptive statistics, cost-efficiency assessment, factor analysis, and regression modeling to identify associations between farm and farmer characteristics, risk perceptions, and risk management responses.Results reveal clear system-level distinctions. Pond farmers, though more experienced, operate at a smaller scale compared to cage farmers. Pond farmers perceive financial and climate risks as most significant and typically employ diversification and subsidy-dependent strategies. Cage farmers, by contrast, are more concerned with operational and market risks and respond through investments in feed quality, infrastructure, and harvest timing. Although cost-saving practices such as homemade feeds are common, they can extend production cycles, increasing vulnerability to theft and labor demands, especially in cage systems.Risk management choices are often shaped by limited information, resource constraints, and behavioral biases, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Cost-efficiency analysis shows that high-cost, high-loss risks, such as water quality deterioration and fish mortality, remain under-managed due to prohibitive mitigation costs, despite their substantial economic consequences.These findings highlight the need for targeted public interventions, such as early-warning systems, price and input quality regulation, tailored extension, and accessible financial tools, to promote preventative, cost-effective risk management. Strengthening these areas can enhance the efficiency and resilience of the aquaculture sector in Kenya and inform policy in similar emerging economies."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5c3c\u7f57\u7f57\u975e\u9c7c\u517b\u6b96\u6237\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c60\u5858\u4e0e\u7f51\u7bb1\u517b\u6b96\u6237\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5c3c\u7f57\u7f57\u975e\u9c7c\u517b\u6b96\u6237\u5982\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u91c7\u53d6\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1f", "motivation": "\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u6de1\u6c34\u517b\u6b96\u4e1a\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u5206\u6790\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u6c60\u5858\u517b\u6b96\u6237\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e0e\u8865\u8d34\uff1b\u7f51\u7bb1\u517b\u6b96\u6237\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u4e8e\u9972\u6599\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5982\u6c34\u8d28\u6076\u5316\u56e0\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u800c\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5982\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u76d1\u7ba1\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5de5\u5177\u7b49\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u517b\u6b96\u4e1a\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

During the McCarthy era, the United States Civil Service Commission (CSC), under pressure from Congress, implemented a sweeping loyalty program aimed at rooting out purportedly disloyal federal employees. Though often remembered as a moment of political overreach and civil liberties violations, this Article shows that the loyalty program simultaneously catalyzed a surprising expansion in procedural rights for government workers\u2014both through internal reforms initiated by the CSC and through judicial decisions that extended emerging administrative law doctrines into the domain of federal employment.</p>\n<p>Drawing on original archival research, this Article reconstructs how the Loyalty Review Board, housed within the CSC, developed formalized standards for loyalty adjudications, including evidentiary thresholds, rights to notice and counsel, and appellate review. These procedures, while initially limited to loyalty hearings, came to inform broader doctrines governing the removal and discipline of civil servants. In particular, courts began to apply principles such as the Accardi doctrine and the Chenery rule\u2014originally developed for public-facing regulatory action\u2014to disputes between the federal government and its own employees. The result was a nascent body of administrative law that treated personnel decisions not as matters of unfettered executive discretion, but as legal acts subject to procedural constraint.</p>\n<p>The Article makes two central claims. First, it argues that civil service law should be understood as a core component of administrative law\u2014not merely a subspecialty of public employment law. Legal rules governing the hiring, discipline, and removal of civil servants serve the same functions as more familiar administrative law doctrines: they mediate interbranch conflict, preventing any one branch from dominating federal policy-making and thus serving deeper separation-of-powers and rule of law values. Second, it argues that the regulation of federal employment not only prevents the aggrandizement of the political branches, but also protects individual rights. In the postwar era, federal jobs functioned as a major form of state-administered benefit, and the procedures surrounding those jobs shaped broader public expectations about fairness, merit, and due process. Those expectations were deeply challenged during the unrest of the McCarthy period, but were ultimately vindicated by the creative adaption of administrative law principles.</p>\n<p>These lessons are newly relevant today, as the second Trump administration embarks upon one of the most ambitious attempts to remake the federal civil service in generations, often explicitly seeking to replace merit systems with tests of personal and political loyalty.<i></i></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5fe0\u8bda\u5b89\u5168\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0e\u884c\u653f\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u9ea6\u5361\u9521\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\uff08CSC\uff09\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5fe0\u8bda\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0d\u4ec5\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u653f\u6cbb\u8d8a\u6743\u548c\u4fb5\u72af\u516c\u6c11\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u8c61\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u610f\u5916\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u653f\u5e9c\u96c7\u5458\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6743\u5229\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6863\u6848\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ba1\u67e5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3b\u5f20\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u6cd5\u662f\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "research_question": "\u8054\u90a6\u5fe0\u8bda\u5b89\u5168\u8ba1\u5212\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u73b0\u4ee3\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9ea6\u5361\u9521\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5fe0\u8bda\u8ba1\u5212\u5e38\u88ab\u6279\u8bc4\u4e3a\u653f\u6cbb\u8d8a\u6743\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6743\u5229\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4f5c\u7528\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fAccardi\u539f\u5219\u548cChenery\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u6cd5\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u6863\u6848\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ba1\u67e5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6f14\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u5fe0\u8bda\u8ba1\u5212\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6743\u5229\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6cd5\u9662\u5c06\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u539f\u5219\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u6cd5\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u662f\u516c\u5171\u5c31\u4e1a\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u652f\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u8054\u90a6\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u5236\u5ea6\u6539\u9769\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u501f\u9274\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6cd5\u6cbb\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To this end, we identify the corresponding \u0093safe\u0094 domain and show that the pivotal value that demarcates this domain can be elicited from a simple linear function of the Gini coefficient itself.

In the post-pandemic landscape, with the growing desire for remote work, employers are now thinking more critically about how employment decisions may affect nexus and related issues for state and local taxes, workers\u2019 compensation, and other compliance burdens. Indeed, carefully weighing the tax and compliance burdens associated with hiring a particular candidate may be outcome-determinative in the selection process.</p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s therefore axiomatic that, everything else being equal, if a particular job candidate would come with lower tax and compliance burdens, that candidate would be more attractive than those who would come with higher burdens. And it may well be that although a particular candidate is stronger in certain areas, any relative marginal increase in strengths is outweighed by the added marginal tax and compliance burden, thereby distorting company-level decision-making and therefore, in the aggregate, the labor market generally.</span></p>\n<p><span>From an employer\u2019s perspective, one might think that the same tax burden would apply to all job candidates \u2014 particularly if they are physically located in the same office or work location. But when it comes to employment taxes, that proposition does not hold true. Nonresident aliens who work in the United States using certain visas, such as F-1 and M-1 visas (student visas), receive a carveout from the definition of employment under the IRC1 such that both they and their employers are exempt from making employment tax payments. The economic implications associated with this exemption are vast and far-reaching. Because of the absence of employment tax obligations, individuals holding these student visas immediately become more attractive job candidates. Consequently, U.S.-based employers have an incentive to hire student visa holders instead of U.S. citizens and residents. Another issue associated with the foregoing labor problem is that, as a result of the student visa employment tax exemption, those dollars are not being paid into the Social Security trust fund, whose asset reserves are projected to be depleted by 2033.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The public policy question is therefore whether it is prudent to institute tax reform measures that would level the employment playing field between and among U.S. citizens, resident taxpayers, and NRAs and, at the same time, promote Social Security solvency.

Using import tariff reductions as an exogenous shock, we find that in response to heightened competition, suppliers reallocate their investments from long-term R&D expenses to short-term trade credit, suggesting that suppliers balance the need to retain key customers while mitigating increased holdup risks. Cross-sectional analyses show that the decline in R&D spending and increase in trade credit is most pronounced in firms highly vulnerable to holdup risks, whereas firms more dependent on their supply chain tend to offer greater trade credit while maintaining their R&D investment. These findings underscore strategic adjustments made by suppliers to maintain competitiveness and manage risks in the face of shifting market dynamics. We confirm the robustness of these results through placebo tests, entropy balancing, stacked regressions, and alternative tariff cut scenarios."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5916\u56fd\u7ade\u4e89\u52a0\u5267\u5bf9\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5173\u7cfb\u4e13\u7528\u6295\u8d44\uff08RSI\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u53e3\u5173\u7a0e\u524a\u51cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u751f\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5c06\u6295\u8d44\u4ece\u957f\u671f\u7814\u53d1\u8f6c\u5411\u77ed\u671f\u8d38\u6613\u4fe1\u8d37\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u88ab\u5957\u7262\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "research_question": "\u5916\u56fd\u7ade\u4e89\u52a0\u5267\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e13\u7528\u6295\u8d44\u9009\u62e9\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u52a0\u5267\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u6574\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5173\u7cfb\u4e13\u7528\u6295\u8d44\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5957\u7262\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8fdb\u53e3\u5173\u7a0e\u524a\u51cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u751f\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u71b5\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u5806\u53e0\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5173\u7a0e\u524a\u51cf\u60c5\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5c06\u6295\u8d44\u4ece\u7814\u53d1\u8f6c\u5411\u8d38\u6613\u4fe1\u8d37\uff0c\u5957\u7262\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u7814\u53d1\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u5219\u7ef4\u6301\u7814\u53d1\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u8d38\u6613\u4fe1\u8d37\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u4e13\u7528\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u5957\u7262\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e73\u8861\u5ba2\u6237\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

While the governance role of institutional investors is known, the impact of their direct, on-the-ground engagement remains underexplored. This study's objective is to investigate how institutional investor site visits, a crucial hands-on governance mechanism, affect stock return volatility. Using a sample of Chinese-listed A-share firms from 2012 to 2022, we find that frequent site visits significantly reduce firm-level stock return volatility. This risk-reduction effect is more pronounced for firms with greater agency problems, poorer ESG performance, and higher expropriation risk. Our analysis, robust to endogeneity concerns, indicates this effect is driven by improved external oversight. We conclude that direct institutional engagement is a vital channel for reducing information asymmetry, enhancing corporate governance, and ultimately promoting market stability by lowering investment risk."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u8bbf\u95ee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80a1\u7968\u56de\u62a5\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u3001ESG\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u548c\u4fb5\u5360\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "research_question": "\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u8bbf\u95ee\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u80a1\u7968\u56de\u62a5\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u53c2\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282012-2022\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fdA\u80a1\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u5730\u8bbf\u95ee\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u80a1\u7968\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u8bbf\u95ee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80a1\u7968\u56de\u62a5\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u3001ESG\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u548c\u4fb5\u5360\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u673a\u6784\u53c2\u4e0e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6cbb\u7406\u6e20\u9053\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u76f4\u63a5\u53c2\u4e0e\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u8d44\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Google Ireland (C-250/25), the first case to bring generative AI before the CJEU. It examines whether the training and output of systems like Gemini infringe exclusive rights under EU copyright law. We argue that AI model training may involve acts of reproduction under Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive, while the dissemination of AI-generated outputsespecially through public interfaces-may trigger the right of communication to the public under Article 3. Particular concerns arise when protected content is recognisably reproduced or when AI outputs serve as functional substitutes for original works, thereby affecting the normal exploitation of those works. While not a formal infringement criterion, such functional substitution is relevant in assessing the application of exceptions and compliance with the three-step test. The paper also challenges the applicability of the text and data mining exception to generative uses, highlighting its incompatibility with the limitations imposed by the three-step test.

Assemblies had the power to make laws and elect magistrates. These assemblies have been widely criticized by both ancient and modern observers for making poor decisions, but the reasons they would have done so are not well understood. This paper develops a public choice model of ancient assemblies to illuminate the challenges they faced and explain why their decisions may not have enjoyed popular support. The model assumes that policy con licts stem from different preferences between urban and rural citizens, and that voting was more costly for rural than urban citizens because of travel costs.

Given the continent\u2019s demographic and structural challenges, transitioning to higher value-added, technologically advanced industries is a necessity. However, energy poverty remains a major obstacle. As energy is critical to all stages of industrial production, the lack of reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity constrains industrial growth. Against this backdrop, this study analyses the effects of energy poverty on industrial performance across 33 African countries over the period 1996\u20132020, using the System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) approach and a new Index, the Competitive Industrial Performance (CIP). Through a series of robustness checks, the results indicate that reducing energy poverty has a positive and statistically significant impact on industrial performance in Africa. Moreover, this study highlights the mediating role of human capital, financial development, and income level in the relationship between energy poverty and industrial performance. Furthermore, the findings reveal that reducing energy poverty enhances the capacity for industrial development, with significant impacts on the industrial sector and structural transformation. These results re-affirm the importance for African countries to improve the accessibility and availability of energy to support industrialisation and economic development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e861996-2020\u5e74\u95f4\u975e\u6d3233\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u6536\u5165\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\uff1f", "motivation": "\u975e\u6d32\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u591a\u5143\u5316\u548c\u5c31\u4e1a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u6536\u5165\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e7f\u4e49\u77e9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08SGMM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6570\uff08CIP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u6536\u5165\u6c34\u5e73\u8d77\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e2d\u4ecb\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u80fd\u6e90\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Despite major investments in irrigation infrastructure, uniform irrigation practices commonly applied at the cooperative level fail to account for significant spatial variability in soil properties, resulting in inefficient water use and crop water stress. This study investigates the extent of soil heterogeneity within a 10-hectare agricultural cooperative in Bugesera District, Rwanda, and evaluates its implications for irrigation performance. Soil classification and infiltration measurements were conducted at 27 georeferenced points, followed by infiltration modeling using Horton\u2019s equation. A one-dimensional soil water balance model, based on FAO-56 principles, simulated soil moisture dynamics under the existing irrigation regime of weekly 25 mm applications for a 10-week bean-growing season. Results revealed pronounced variability in soil texture and infiltration rates, ranging from high-permeability gravels to low-infiltration clayey soils. Under uniform irrigation, coarse soils exhibited frequent water stress (12 days) due to rapid percolation losses (67.9 mm), whereas fine-textured soils experienced severe stress (58 days) as 71% of applied water was lost as runoff. In contrast, silty sand provided the most balanced outcome with zero stress and minimal losses (14.2 mm runoff, 22.4 mm percolation). These findings demonstrate that irrigation uniformity across heterogeneous soils compromises both water use efficiency and crop performance. Site-specific strategies such as adjusting irrigation frequency, application rates, and nutrient management to local soil properties are essential to enhance water productivity and sustainability in Rwandan hillside farming systems."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5362\u65fa\u8fbe\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u5c71\u5761\u519c\u4e1a\u56e0\u571f\u58e4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u704c\u6e89\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u9700\u56e0\u5730\u5236\u5b9c\u8c03\u6574\u704c\u6e89\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f5c\u7269\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "research_question": "\u5362\u65fa\u8fbeBugesera\u5730\u533a10\u516c\u9877\u519c\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u704c\u6e89\u6027\u80fd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u704c\u6e89\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u704c\u6e89\u5b9e\u8df5\u672a\u80fd\u8003\u8651\u571f\u58e4\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u4f5c\u7269\u6c34\u5206\u80c1\u8feb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eFAO-56\u539f\u5219\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u6c34\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u548cHorton\u65b9\u7a0b\u6e17\u900f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u572827\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u571f\u58e4\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u6a21\u62df10\u5468\u8c46\u7c7b\u751f\u957f\u5b63\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u6c34\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "findings": "\u571f\u58e4\u8d28\u5730\u548c\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5747\u5300\u704c\u6e89\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c97\u8d28\u571f\u58e4\u6c34\u5206\u80c1\u8feb12\u5929\uff0c\u7ec6\u8d28\u571f\u58e4\u80c1\u8feb58\u5929\uff0c\u800c\u7c89\u7802\u58e4\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u571f\u58e4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u704c\u6e89\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u56e0\u5730\u5236\u5b9c\u704c\u6e89\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u6839\u636e\u571f\u58e4\u7279\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u704c\u6e89\u9891\u7387\u3001\u65bd\u6c34\u91cf\u548c\u517b\u5206\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5362\u65fa\u8fbe\u5c71\u5761\u519c\u4e1a\u7684\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002"}}

The findings underscore the need for clear, accurate information to complement policy efforts, reducing disinformation and amplifying the impact of initiatives to meet climate goals."}, "AI": {"tldr": "2023\u5e74\u6b27\u6d32\u4ea4\u901a\u90e8\u95e8\u5360\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u91cf\u768425%\uff0c\u81ea2010\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u653f\u5e9c\u63a8\u52a8\u8131\u78b3\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\uff08EV\uff09\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc75500\u540d\u5fb7\u56fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u5bf9EV\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5f3a\u8c03EV\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\uff09\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9009\u62e9EV\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u610f\u613f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6e05\u6670\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u653f\u7b56\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u5021\u8bae\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "research_question": "\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6b27\u6d32\u4ea4\u901a\u90e8\u95e8\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5c45\u9ad8\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u8fdb\u5c55\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u969c\u788d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca5500\u540d\u5fb7\u56fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9009\u62e9EV\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u610f\u613f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5728EV\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u5347EV\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This paper investigates how potential cooperation between firms on corporate social responsibility (CSR) investments affects price competition. The experiment implements communication among sellers in some treatments during the investment stage, using free-form chat or more restrictive messages focused on the CSR investment decision. These alternative communication treatments act as a proxy for the competition authorities\u2019 ability to monitor and scrutinize firms\u2019 cooperative investment agreements. Treatments also vary costs and demand so that either investment or noninvestment is a profit-maximizing strategy conditional on noncooperative pricing. The experiment identifies the causal impact of investment on pricing, and how cooperative CSR affects welfare in imperfectly competitive markets. Experimental results reveal that investment rates are significantly lower with rich communication than in more limited communication treatments.

We develop a quantifiable model with two-sided firm heterogeneity, matching frictions, and imperfect competition. More productive buyers match with more suppliers, which spurs tougher competition, lowers input costs, and raises profits. Reduced-form evidence confirms that larger French and Chilean firms import higher quantities at lower prices as more Chinese suppliers enter, and that suppliers charge diversified buyers lower markups. We estimate the model by extending recent methods for combinatorial discrete-choice problems. Counterfactuals reveal that entry upstream benefits primarily high-productivity buyers, while lower trade or matching costs favor mid-productivity firms. Moreover, the interaction between endogenous networks and markups significantly amplifies the welfare gains from entry upstream, as well as from packaging trade liberalization with reductions in matching or entry costs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u751f\u4ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u8fb9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u5339\u914d\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e70\u5bb6\u4e0e\u66f4\u591a\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u7ade\u4e89\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u5165\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5229\u6da6\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u6e38\u8fdb\u5165\u548c\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e70\u5bb6\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "research_question": "\u5168\u7403\u751f\u4ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u6536\u76ca\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u653f\u7b56\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u751f\u4ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53cc\u8fb9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u5339\u914d\u6469\u64e6\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff08\u6cd5\u56fd\u548c\u667a\u5229\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e70\u5bb6\u4e0e\u66f4\u591a\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u7ade\u4e89\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u5165\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5229\u6da6\uff1b\u4e0a\u6e38\u8fdb\u5165\u4e3b\u8981\u60e0\u53ca\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e70\u5bb6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u4ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u8d38\u6613\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d38\u6613\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u4e0e\u964d\u4f4e\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8fdb\u5165\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Using Chilean customs data, we document strong concentration among carriers and importers and show that freight prices are determined through bilateral bargaining under two-sided market power. We estimate a trade model that endogenizes transportation costs by embedding oligopoly and oligopsony in the transport sector, along with bilateral bargaining. We find sizable carrier markups, partially offset by importer bargaining power. Embedding this mechanism into a quantitative trade model, we find that the endogenous response of transportation costs reduces the welfare cost of tariffs by 50% compared to the standard case of iceberg trade costs.

At the same time, they remain a priority on the political agenda, as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals. Water security offers a comprehensive framework for disentangling the complex relationships between freshwater resources and human development.WS encompasses economic, environmental, and hazard dimensions, yet existing measurement approaches suffer from heterogeneity, limited comparability, and poor temporal coverage. This paper advances WS research in three ways. First, we present an original, reproducible global WS assessment at 0.5\u00b0\u00d70.5\u00b0 resolution from 2003\u20132019, integrating Earth observations and statistical data to capture multidimensional risks and resources. Second, we apply both weak and strong sustainability frameworks to WS, revealing substantial discrepancies in estimated security levels and threat areas, with weak sustainability systematically overestimating WS. Third, we examine how economic development and governance interact with WS at the national scale, distinguishing size and intensity effects and identifying institutional conditions that shape outcomes. Our analysis reveals that the weak sustainability approach systematically overestimates both the quality and progression of WS when compared with the strong sustainability approach, a discrepancy primarily attributable to the underlying embeddedness assumption. The mechanisms analysis highlight the non-linearities linking economic and political development to WS levels."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u7403\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f31\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u9ad8\u4f30\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u5bf9\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u7403\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6de1\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5f31\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa0.5\u00b0\u00d70.5\u00b0\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff082003-2019\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u5f31\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u5bf9\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, the ex-ante Sharpe ratio is discovered to have a significantly negative association with only the latter two variables. The overall findings supply support for the hypothesis that the market risk premium is economically countercyclical due primarily to procyclical investor risk tolerance. Measures of financial market volatility and sentiment are found to have no separate impact on the equity premium, and no evidence is found of higher inflation rates increasing risk premiums on the stock market. On the other hand, there is evidence that higher levels of uncertainty relating to geopolitics and economic policy increase the extra return that investors require for risk. The results of this research provide important new evidence supporting consumption asset pricing models, especially those which assume that investors value the resolution of uncertainty and thus require higher discount factors during adversely uncertain economic environments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u8d85\u989d\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2a\u4eba\u6d88\u8d39\u652f\u51fa\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5546\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u901a\u80c0\u3001\u77ed\u671f\u5229\u7387\u548c\u671f\u9650\u5229\u5dee\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u4e8b\u524d\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0e\u540e\u4e24\u8005\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u4ef7\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u98ce\u9669\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u7684\u987a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u800c\u5448\u73b0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9006\u5468\u671f\u6027\u3002\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u5bf9\u80a1\u7968\u6ea2\u4ef7\u65e0\u72ec\u7acb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u901a\u80c0\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u4ef7\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u91cd\u89c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u5229\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8981\u6c42\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "research_question": "\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u8d85\u989d\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u4e0e\u54ea\u4e9b\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\uff1f\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u4ef7\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9006\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u4ef7\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d88\u8d39\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6d88\u8d39\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u98ce\u9669\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u8d85\u989d\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6d88\u8d39\u652f\u51fa\u3001\u5546\u54c1\u4ef7\u683c\u901a\u80c0\u3001\u77ed\u671f\u5229\u7387\u548c\u671f\u9650\u5229\u5dee\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u4e8b\u524d\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0e\u77ed\u671f\u5229\u7387\u548c\u671f\u9650\u5229\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u4ef7\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9006\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u98ce\u9669\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u7684\u987a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u4ef7\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u652f\u6301\u6d88\u8d39\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u91cd\u89c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u4ef7\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5236\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Our study applies three decades of data from 25 African economies to a Panel-VECM to assess periodic shifts in GHG emissions, with financial development and renewable energy consumption as the cointegrating vectors. Countries were classified based on their use of hydropower relative to their industrial activities. Our empirical results show a long-run relationship between the cointegrating vectors: financial development and renewable energy acting as stabilising factors in GHG emissions. The results reveal employment in industry, foreign direct investment (FDI), fossil fuel, and industrial performance, which Granger-cause GHG emissions. A rise in one unit of fossil fuel consumption and FDI causes an increase in GHG emissions by 69% and 24%, respectively.

This article challenges the top-down model of authoritarian institutional change by showing how firms' strategic adaption to such reforms could offset their intended effects. We examine a major reform in China that centralized court authority at the provincial level. Using a difference-indifferences strategy and a Bartik-style design, we find that the reform does not consistently attract investment by improving market conditions. Instead, politically reliant firms shift investments away from reformed cities and relocate to provincial capitals, where centralized authority creates new space for political patronage. These shifts are most pronounced in provincial capitals with stronger patronage networks, proxied by lower marketization, higher corruption, and closer pre-existing political ties. Moreover, firms engage in strategic co-optation of higher-level officials post-reform, constructing new political ties through revolving-door appointments. These findings highlight a key constraint on legal institutionalization: under weak rule of law, judicial reforms are prone to spatial capture by resilient patronage networks, enabling the continuation of political favoritism and limiting the emergence of rule-based markets."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5a01\u6743\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u62b5\u6d88\u6539\u9769\u9884\u671f\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7701\u7ea7\u6cd5\u9662\u96c6\u6743\u6539\u9769\u5e76\u672a\u5438\u5f15\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4f9d\u8d56\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u8f6c\u79fb\u6295\u8d44\u81f3\u7701\u4f1a\u57ce\u5e02\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5e87\u62a4\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "research_question": "\u5a01\u6743\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u5728\u5a01\u6743\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f01\u4e1a\u6218\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u62b5\u6d88\u6539\u9769\u9884\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5a01\u6743\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u53d8\u8fc1\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u5e87\u62a4\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff08DID\uff09\u548cBartik-style\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56fd\u7701\u7ea7\u6cd5\u9662\u96c6\u6743\u6539\u9769\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u6539\u9769\u672a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u5438\u5f15\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4f9d\u8d56\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u8f6c\u79fb\u6295\u8d44\u81f3\u7701\u4f1a\u57ce\u5e02\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5e87\u62a4\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u5728\u5f31\u6cd5\u6cbb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5a01\u6743\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u5236\u5ea6\u53d8\u8fc1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53f8\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u653f\u6cbb\u5e87\u62a4\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u8b66\u793a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6cd5\u6cbb\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Green jobs are often presented as key levers to achieve this objective, as they enable the creation of new employment opportunities across a wide spectrum of occupations, including low skill ones. In this paper we investigate if and how these opportunities are seized by one of the most vulnerable segment of the labor force, namely migrants. By relying on detailed administrative data covering more that 12 million contract activations in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) we document that, after controlling for potential confounders, migrants are less likely than natives to find employment in green jobs. Moreover, when they do, they have higher chances to be hired with either a fixed-term or an agency contract. Heterogeneity analysis across industries and occupations reveals that such precarious employment patterns are driven primarily by firm attempts to reduce green costs. These results are rationalized through the lenses of institutional segmentation theory. Related policy implications are discussed."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u751f\u6001\u8f6c\u578b\u5bf9\u79fb\u6c11\u5c31\u4e1a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u7eff\u8272\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u8f83\u5c11\u4e14\u5408\u540c\u66f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u800c\u91c7\u53d6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "research_question": "\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u7eff\u8272\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u4eba\u4e0d\u540c\uff1f\u5982\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6b27\u6d32\u653f\u7b56\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u6001\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u7eff\u8272\u5de5\u4f5c\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6760\u6746\uff0c\u4f46\u79fb\u6c11\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4e2d\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u662f\u5426\u516c\u5e73\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u5927\u5229\u827e\u7c73\u5229\u4e9a-\u7f57\u9a6c\u6d85\u5927\u533a\u8d85\u8fc71200\u4e07\u4efd\u5408\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u7eff\u8272\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u5c11\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u4eba\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u7b7e\u8ba2\u56fa\u5b9a\u671f\u9650\u6216\u52b3\u52a1\u6d3e\u9063\u5408\u540c\uff1b\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e\u7eff\u8272\u6210\u672c\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u7eff\u8272\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u52a3\u52bf\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u5584\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u7eff\u8272\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5c31\u4e1a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

While prior research has examined the psychological and demographic drivers of disaster preparation, little attention has been paid to the influence of time poverty on people\u2019s ability to act during warning periods. Thus, we conduct an in-depth exploration of time poverty and time use in hurricane preparation, focusing on Florida communities affected by at least one of the 2024 consecutive hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States. We examined how individuals\u2019 time-related constraints, along with their socio-economic patterns, shape their time use, perceived stress, and preparation behavior in response to hurricane alerts. Through a geographically targeted survey, we collected responses from 1,069 hurricane-affected residents. We analyzed preparation time use, activities, and disruptions to daily routines. Using Latent Class Analysis, we identified five routine time-poverty profiles, including Young Time-Balanced Workers, Time-Rich Non-Workers, Affluent Professionals, Working Overloaded Caregivers, and Strained Low-Income Caregivers. Moderated regression analysis revealed that both overloaded caregivers and time-poor professionals experienced significantly higher stress and were less likely to complete preparations, while respondents with more flexible routines reported less stress. Timely and specific warnings alleviated perceived time scarcity, though this benefit diminished with the onset of the second hurricane. Our findings emphasize that developing targeted early alerts as well as institutional measures, such as flexible work arrangements and support for caregivers, are critical to addressing structural time poverty and improving disaster readiness."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2b\u56f0\u5bf9\u98d3\u98ce\u51c6\u5907\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u538b\u529b\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u51c6\u5907\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9884\u8b66\u548c\u652f\u6301\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2b\u56f0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u98d3\u98ce\u9884\u8b66\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2b\u56f0\u5bf9\u707e\u5bb3\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2b\u56f0\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u707e\u5bb3\u51c6\u5907\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5730\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u8c03\u67e5\uff081,069\u540d\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\uff09\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8c03\u8282\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2b\u56f0\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u8d1f\u8377\u7167\u987e\u8005\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2b\u56f0\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\uff09\u538b\u529b\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u51c6\u5907\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u7075\u6d3b\u9884\u8b66\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u7f3a\u611f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2b\u56f0\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u51c6\u5907\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9884\u8b66\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u7075\u6d3b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b89\u6392\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u707e\u5bb3\u51c6\u5907\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Further analysis uncovers a dual-threshold effect (climate physical risk index, CPRI=21.77 and 24.19) in climate risk pricing, demonstrating a dynamic evolution in investor responses from \"neglect\" to \"acute sensitivity\" and finally to \"marginal adjustment.\" A multi-layered resilience framework\u2014comprising micro-level corporate climate physical risk disclosures, meso-level supply chain resilience, and macro-level urban adaptation capacity\u2014effectively mitigates climate risk premiums.

Moreover, we derive the yield curve for discount rates in equilibrium, associating exogenously determined dividend processes with coupon payments from the government bonds categorized by time-to-maturity, which reflect market outstanding notional adjustments.\u00a0\u00a0The main contribution of our study is the incorporation of changes in the supply of government bonds in the secondary market into the incomplete market equilibrium model. This approach enables us to estimate the impact of net supply changes of the government bonds on super-long discount rates, while incorporating the heterogeneous views of agents regarding fundamental risks, represented by Brownian motion.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we examine how changes in the supply of government bonds impact the pricing of insurance products, including death benefits and pension annuities, through shifts in the super-long discount rates."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5e02\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u8d85\u957f\u671f\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5916\u751f\u5730\u7eb3\u5165\u653f\u5e9c\u878d\u8d44\u548c\u592e\u884c\u8d2d\u4e70\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4ef7\u683c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5747\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u5c06\u4e8c\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u4f9b\u7ed9\u53d8\u5316\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f30\u8ba1\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u51c0\u4f9b\u7ed9\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u8d85\u957f\u671f\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u4f9b\u7ed9\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u8d85\u957f\u671f\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u4f9b\u7ed9\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4fdd\u9669\u4ea7\u54c1\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u51f8\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5916\u751f\u7eb3\u5165\u653f\u5e9c\u878d\u8d44\u548c\u592e\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51f8\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u5747\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4ef7\u683c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "findings": "\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u4f9b\u7ed9\u53d8\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u8d85\u957f\u671f\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f71\u54cd\u4fdd\u9669\u4ea7\u54c1\uff08\u5982\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7ed9\u4ed8\u548c\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u5e74\u91d1\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u653f\u5e9c\u503a\u5238\u4f9b\u7ed9\u52a8\u6001\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u957f\u671f\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u53d8\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4fdd\u9669\u4ea7\u54c1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

In this paper, additivity property for any distortion risk measure of sums of two counter-monotonic risks is investigated. Precisely, let (X1,X2) be a pair of random variables and be the counter-monotonic sum of X1 and X2. Based on the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral representation of distortion risk measures, we will show that under some reasonable conditions about the form of the aggregate loss function there exists for any distortion function g a distortion function g\u03be such that \u03c1g[S\u2212] = \u03c1g\u03be[X1]+\u03c1g\u03be[X2], where g\u03be is the dual distortion function of g\u03be.

We define the substitutability and love-for-variety measures, which are functions of the variety of goods. Since homotheticity alone imposes little restriction, we turn to five subclasses of homothetic demand systems, which are pairwise disjoint with the exception of CES. Under the two classes of GM-CES, both measures are constant, and the love-for-variety measure under CES underestimates the true love-for-variety under GM-CES. Under H.S.A., HDIA, and HIIA, we establish i) substitutability is increasing in iff the 2nd law of demand holds; ii) increasing substitutability implies diminishing love-for-variety. iii) the love-for-variety measure under CES overestimates the true love-for-variety under diminishing love-for-variety.
