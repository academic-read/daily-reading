The current review article critically examines the concept of meta-leadership as a strategic and integrative framework for enhancing coordination and decision-making across diverse organizational and jurisdictional boundaries in times of crisis. Using theoretical underpinnings and real-world examples, the article investigates how meta-leadership fosters cross-sectoral collaboration, enhances situational awareness, and bridges leadership silos in order to generate coherent solutions to complex multidimensional crises. Based on a critical examination of the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental disasters, and cyberattacks, the article underlines meta-leadership\u2019s adaptive value in dealing with uncertainty, utilizing resources, and gaining stakeholder confidence. The article focuses on five meta-leadership indicators: the person, the setting, connection (leading up, leading across), and observations on how such components are performed in various institutional situations. The review also addresses criticisms and limitations of the meta-leadership approach, such as implementation challenges, organizational opposition, and the inability to assess outcomes. The article concludes with a forward-looking debate, emphasizing the importance of institutional investment in leadership development beyond traditional conceptions of command and control. It requires that meta-leadership ideas be included in policy, training, and crisis preparation measures to better prepare leaders for the interconnected crises of the modern day. The article contributes to the scholarly discourse on crisis leadership by offering a comprehensive synthesis of meta-leadership\u2019s evolving role and relevance in contemporary crisis management."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5143\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5371\u673a\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5143\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5371\u673a\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "21\u4e16\u7eaa\u5371\u673a\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u5316\u3001\u9891\u7e41\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9886\u5bfc\u6a21\u5f0f\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5143\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8de8\u8fb9\u754c\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u5982COVID-19\u3001\u73af\u5883\u707e\u5bb3\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "findings": "\u5143\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u90e8\u95e8\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u65bd\u9762\u4e34\u7ec4\u7ec7\u963b\u529b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5371\u673a\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5143\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5143\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7eb3\u5165\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u5371\u673a\u51c6\u5907\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5371\u673a\u3002"}}

In this paper, I applied this method to manga. I hypothesized that manga that created a non-linear lattice is perceived to be more interesting than manga that created using a linear lattice and that manga created a non-linear lattice is perceived to have characters that are more easily distinguishable than manga created a linear lattice. To verify these hypotheses, I constructed three manga using the software ``Koikatsu\" and conducted an experiment on the web.All manga have the same story, only the character&apos;s hair and tone are different.Character hairstyle and tone of voice create a linear or nonlinear lattice.Manga 1 and Manga 2 created linear lattices and Manga 3 created non-linear lattice.In the experiment, participants read the manga and were asked questions about their impression of it.

However, with new technical possibilities and societal trends towards greater integration between work and home, some workplaces have adopted practices that control workers outside of primary work contexts, a phenomenon that is less commonly researched. Focusing on fly-in-fly out (FIFO) camps in Australia, and drawing on total institution (TI) theory, we explore the nature of workplace control practices in employer-provided camps and identify how they affect worker identity and mental health. Combining qualitative (i.e., interviews, n = 24) and quantitative (i.e., surveys; n = 479) approaches, our results show the control practices to manifest in profound ways via stringent rules, surveillance, and treating everyday aspects as privileges in FIFO camps. These practices encroach on workers\u2019 identity through identity suppression and identity duality. Our results further indicate that the control practices are overall detrimental to worker mental health, and that this impact operates mostly through identity suppression and less through identity duality. We advocate for further research to explore the impact of such practices on outcomes beyond mental health and within other non-work contexts. In practice, organizations are encouraged to develop balanced control practices to safeguard mental health, alongside other safety and productivity outcomes."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9aFIFO\u8425\u5730\u4e2d\u96c7\u4e3b\u5bf9\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u8bbf\u8c08\uff09\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\uff08\u8c03\u67e5\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a7\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u76d1\u89c6\u548c\u7279\u6743\u5316\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u5f71\u54cd\u5de5\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u3002", "research_question": "\u96c7\u4e3b\u5728\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\uff08\u5982FIFO\u8425\u5730\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u8df5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5de5\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u5185\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead\u754c\u9650\u6a21\u7cca\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u63a7\u5236\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u201c\u5168\u63a7\u673a\u6784\u201d\uff08Total Institution, TI\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\uff0824\u6b21\u8bbf\u8c08\uff09\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\uff08479\u4efd\u8c03\u67e5\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "FIFO\u8425\u5730\u4e2d\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u8df5\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u76d1\u89c6\u548c\u7279\u6743\u5316\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5de5\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\uff08\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8eab\u4efd\u538b\u5236\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5e73\u8861\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u547c\u5401\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To isolate exogenous variation in the currency composition of firm credit, we exploit a natural experiment: the implementation of Reactiva Peru\u00b4, a government-backed credit program that provided large-scale subsidized loans exclusively in domestic currency. This policy induced a sharp and uneven decline in firms\u2019 use of FX-denominated credit, especially for those more connected to banks with aggressive program participation. We use a shift-share instrumental variable strategy that combines pre-pandemic firm-bank credit relationships with bank-segment-level changes in interest rate differentials across currencies. Our results show that firms more affected by the policy-induced dedollarization shock experienced significantly higher export growth during the pandemic. These findings suggest that credit de-dollarization\u2014when triggered by large, neutral policy interventions\u2014can enhance firm resilience to external shocks by mitigating the risks associated with foreign currency borrowing."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86COVID-19\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u79d8\u9c81\u4f01\u4e1a\u4fe1\u8d37\u53bb\u7f8e\u5143\u5316\u5bf9\u5176\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u653f\u5e9c\u652f\u6301\u7684\u56fd\u5185\u8d27\u5e01\u4fe1\u8d37\u8ba1\u5212\uff08Reactiva Per\u00fa\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u653f\u7b56\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53bb\u7f8e\u5143\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u3002", "research_question": "\u4fe1\u8d37\u53bb\u7f8e\u5143\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u79d8\u9c81\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728COVID-19\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u53bb\u7f8e\u5143\u5316\u653f\u7b56\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u5916\u5e01\u501f\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u8d37\u53bb\u7f8e\u5143\u5316\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u97e7\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916\u5e01\u501f\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u75ab\u60c5\u524d\u4f01\u4e1a-\u94f6\u884c\u4fe1\u8d37\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u94f6\u884c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5229\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u653f\u7b56\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53bb\u7f8e\u5143\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53bb\u7f8e\u5143\u5316\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u97e7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u8d37\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u964d\u4f4e\u4f01\u4e1a\u5916\u5e01\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We develop an asset pricing model in which investors incorporate ESG investments and the exogenous crisis shocks into their decision-making processes. The theoretical analysis reveals that the direction of the relationship between ESG investment and expected returns during crisis periods critically depends on the severity of the shock experienced by individual stocks. We empirically test these theoretical predictions using the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment, analyzing the returns of Chinese A-share listed firms from October 2019 to May 2020. Our empirical results indicate that higher ESG level positively affects excess returns among stocks severely impacted by the crisis but negatively affects stocks less affected by it. These findings are consistent with our theoretical predictions, underscoring the nuanced role ESG factors play during market disruptions. This research contributes to the understanding of how ESG investment can dynamically influence stock performance during crisis periods and highlights the role of financial capital in fostering corporate green transformation and\u2028sustainability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86ESG\u6295\u8d44\u5728\u5371\u673a\u671f\u95f4\u7f13\u89e3\u80a1\u7968\u8868\u73b0\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ESG\u6c34\u5e73\u5bf9\u53d7\u5371\u673a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "ESG\u6295\u8d44\u5728\u5371\u673a\u671f\u95f4\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u80a1\u7968\u8868\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8ESG\u6295\u8d44\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u8361\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5c06ESG\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u5371\u673a\u51b2\u51fb\u7eb3\u5165\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5COVID-19\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56fdA\u80a1\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u9ad8ESG\u6c34\u5e73\u5bf9\u53d7\u5371\u673a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u6709\u6b63\u5411\u8d85\u989d\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5bf9\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u6709\u8d1f\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ESG\u6295\u8d44\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5371\u673a\u65f6\u671f\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5728\u5371\u673a\u671f\u95f4\u914d\u7f6eESG\u8d44\u4ea7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f01\u4e1a\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}
