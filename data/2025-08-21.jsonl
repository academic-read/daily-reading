It also shapes both general economic conditions and individual behaviors such as status signaling through conspicuous consumption. However, the relation between inequality-induced status consumption and reduced health remains unclear. Moreover, most prior research has examined inequality's effects at large spatial scales, such as nation or US State, but people's personal experiences of inequality likely depend on everyday encounters within smaller geographical regions. This study therefore examines how health outcomes are linked to status-enhancing consumption and zipcode-level income inequality. Our dataset combines ten years of daily decision-making, covering 650 million purchases, with chronic health outcomes for 470,000 individuals. We find an association between short-term indicators of status enhancement behavior and long-term health: conspicuous consumption is greater when local income inequality is high, and this status-enhancing spending is negatively associated with health. A 1 percentage point increase in the status consumption score is associated with a 3 percentage point increase in the log odds of anxiety and depression when inequality is high, but no change when inequality is low. Results are consistent with the hypotheses that (a) local income inequality increases status-related consumption, and (b) increased status-related consumption impairs health. We discuss alternative interpretations and implications for public health strategies and inequality-mitigating economic policies."}}

Purchasing becomes particularly challenging due to the rise in transportation costs, and stores that remain open witness an increase in demand due to displacements and stockpiling. Product availability is severely affected, and consumers might be forced to engage in stockout-based substitution while retailers connect with responsive suppliers to have items on their shelves. This paper studies the potential mitigating effect that suppliers that are located close to the retailers, defined as local suppliers, might have when retailers face a major disruption. Methodology/results: We combine retail scanner data, household panel data, supplier location data, and information from major disaster declarations following a North Atlantic hurricane. Using a triple difference framework, we compare sales of products from local versus non-local suppliers before and after the disaster, in affected versus non-affected stores. We find that affected stores witness a significant increase in sales after the disaster, which is mainly driven by sales of products from local suppliers. We explore several mechanisms to find that there is an increase in the availability of products from local suppliers and that frequently purchasing households decide to substitute to brands from local suppliers in the aftermath of the disaster. Managerial implications: Our findings show that local suppliers can have a potential mitigating effect when retailers face a disruption so that shelves are stocked and consumers are able to find and purchase products."}}

While public feedback on solvers’ contributions in such a network potentially plays a vital role, its impact on the innovation dynamics and progress has not been well understood or investigated. In this study, we fill this gap by exploring how public performance feedback guides expert solvers’ efforts and contributions in an interdependent innovation network enabled by collaborative expert crowdsourcing. Focusing on crowdsourced drug discovery as our main research context, we leverage a unique dataset from a crowdsourced drug discovery platform aiming to find cures for COVID-19 to empirically examine the impact of performance feedback for a preceding drug design on the number of solvers who build on this design and the volume and nature of subsequent designs, based on a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) framework. We find that surprisingly, while both positive and negative feedback can attract more solvers to build on a preceding work, only negative feedback increases the volume of subsequent designs. Further, negative feedback also leads to more subsequent drug designs with incremental (instead of radical) changes, which nevertheless serve as the major driver behind the overall innovation progress. Our study provides important conceptual understanding and empirical evidence for the roles of performance feedback, especially the negative feedback, in shaping the innovation dynamics in collaborative expert crowdsourcing, for technological and scientific innovations, such as drug discovery. In the absence of formal coordination structures, such as those found in the organizational collaborations, public performance feedback guides contributors’ engagement and participation in the free-form collaborative innovation environment.&nbsp;"}}

Critically, board experience heterogeneity attenuates this curvilinear effect, enabling better risk governance and decision-making. These findings challenge prevailing linear assumptions, reconcile contradictory evidence, and highlight how governance can amplify the value of cybersecurity investments. This study offers actionable guidance to firms and practitioners striving to align cybersecurity expenditures with financial stability and stakeholder confidence."}}

Despite the compelling capabilities and benefits of IoTs, technical, strategic, and operational challenges damper the success of IoT adoptions (Rejeb et al., (2020). This qualitative study explored strategies that IT professionals in the supply chain sector should consider when adopting IoT for supply chain digital transformation. An extensive literature review uncovered key determinants and drivers of the adoption of IoTs in the supply chain; the implications and use cases of other industry 4.0 digital technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analytics, additive manufacturing, blockchain, and nanotechnology that converge with IoTs for supply chain transformation. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, this research answered two research questions to uncover the drivers behind IoT adoption failures and strategies to consider for ensuring adoption success. These questions were (a) what causes failures in IoT adoptions in the supply chain business and (b) what strategies IT professionals should consider when adopting IoT for supply chain digital transformation. The research was conducted via Zoom using 9 open-ended questions involving IT professionals undertaking IoT initiatives in the supply chain sector. The research findings suggest that there are key success strategies for IoT adoption around budgeting, technology, organization, change management, governance, project methodology, strategic alignments, and security. This research fills the gap in extant literature and contributes to the body of knowledge for success strategies for IoT adoption."}}

This paper shows that PCGs can transform banks into \"empty creditors\" with reduced loss exposure, leading to inefficient defaults. Using comprehensive loan-level data from Türkiye's 2017 PCG program---the world's largest at the time---we find that, conditional on distress, PCG loans exhibit substantially higher default rates and lower restructuring rates than non-PCG loans, even when comparing loans to the same firm in the same quarter. The effect strengthens with higher guarantee coverage and weakens as banks approach portfolio-level loss caps, demonstrating moral hazard as the underlying mechanism. Information frictions do not appear to drive these results; the effect is strongest for the most transparent borrowers. Crucially, a policy reform mandating restructuring attempts before reimbursement and introducing annual reimbursement caps eliminated nearly half of the adverse PCG effect, confirming distorted incentives are the primary driver. This restructuring distortion generates substantial real costs: sharp declines in firm revenues, investment, and employment, and severed supplier-customer networks. Our findings underscore the need to balance credit expansion with incentive-aligned restructuring mechanisms in PCG program design."}}

This paper contributes to the debate by examining how internal strategic decisions, sustainability practices, and governance mechanisms moderate the internationalisation–performance relationship. The analysis incorporates firm-level fixed effects and employs robust estimation techniques, including Propensity Score Matching and GMM, to address endogeneity concerns. Results show that internationalisation positively influences market valuation, reflecting investor confidence in firms that signal growth, diversification, and adaptability. The effect is stronger for firms with effective inventory management and active business portfolio restructuring. Moreover, ESG performance enhances, while ESG controversies diminish, the positive valuation effects of internationalisation. Audit committee strength and higher institutional ownership also reinforce this relationship, highlighting the role of governance in complex international operations. Findings are robust across alternative model specifications and crisis periods, including the Global Financial Crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, and Russia–Ukraine conflict. This study offers theoretical and practical insights by integrating institutional theory and the resource-based view, and by emphasising the strategic contingencies that shape market responses to global expansion."}}

While large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous domains [Brown et al. 2020, Touvron et al. 2023], their direct application to sophisticated logistics environments encounters significant limitations due to domain-specific requirements, operational constraints, and real-time decision-making complexities [Ling et al. 2024]. This comprehensive research presents a systematic framework for specializing large language models specifically for last mile delivery operations through carefully orchestrated domain adaptation methodologies [Anisuzzaman et al. 2025]. The investigation introduces an innovative accessibility-based taxonomy that systematically categorizes specialization techniques into three comprehensive tiers: external augmentation mechanisms for black-box environments, sophisticated prompt engineering approaches for grey-box implementations, and comprehensive fine-tuning methodologies for white-box applications [Ling et al. 2024]. The proposed framework addresses critical operational challenges including dynamic route optimization under real-time constraints [Christofides et al. 1979], intelligent customer communication systems [Hu et al. 2021], integrated fleet management coordination [Savelsbergh et al. 2016], and advanced predictive demand forecasting capabilities [Bell et al. 2018]. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and practical implementation guidelines, this work demonstrates how specialized language models can transform conventional delivery operations by substantially reducing costs by up to 23%, improving customer satisfaction scores by 31%, and enabling sustainable logistics practices through optimized routing and resource allocation [Joerss et al. 2016]. The methodology provides logistics practitioners with a comprehensive roadmap for deploying intelligent delivery systems while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance standards."}}

Twoway fixed-effect regression models reveal that counties with heightened climate risk awareness significantly correlate with lower housing values, elevated price-to-income ratios, and increased migration rates, demonstrating capitalization of perceived climate risks into housing markets. These relationships exhibit notable heterogeneity contingent upon homeownership rates, income levels, and coastal proximity.

This paper introduces the Layered Operator Appraisal (LOA), which treats infrastructure as an operator acting on a three-layer system. The full operator view can be simplified-or coarse grained-in two very different ways. One reduction yields the conventional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) frame, suited to small, predictable systems where prices capture most effects. The other reduction yields a complexity science (CS) frame, suited to large, adaptive systems where infrastructure equips millions of people to interact and form new capabilities. Both reductions are valid only in special circumstances. CBA is valid only when a problem can genuinely be reduced to a two-body world, effects can be measured and monetised, and underlying dynamics are stable. CS is valid only when the interaction space can be defined, which is rare, and even then CS seeks to understand and frame, not to predict. There are also situations when neither CBA nor CS is valid, yet a decision must still be made. In such cases, when we just do not know, the decision is down to political discretion. We must know enough to know when we do not know-and we must say so-so that future generations understand the uncertainty under which we acted."}}

This reform replaces the previous managed exchange rate regime with a more flexible mechanism, aligning the national currency more closely with market dynamics. This study explores the multifaceted impact of this transition on FDI inflows by examining both the opportunities and risks introduced by the reform. Employing a mixed-method research design, the study integrates quantitative analysis with qualitative insights. Quantitatively, Pearson's correlation and linear regression models are used to assess the relationship between exchange rate movements and FDI inflow patterns from 2010 to 2024. Qualitatively, in-depth interviews and expert consultations were conducted with key stakeholders, including central bank officials, foreign investors, policy advisors, and academic economists, to gain contextual understanding and nuanced perspectives. The findings indicate a positive and statistically significant correlation between exchange rate stability and FDI inflows, particularly in sectors oriented toward exports, such as manufacturing and agro-processing. A more transparent and competitive exchange rate system has improved investor confidence and reduced market distortions. However, the study also highlights emerging risks, including inflationary pressures, exchange rate volatility, and the challenges of implementing policy in a liberalized regime. The paper concludes that while Ethiopia's market-based exchange rate reform has the potential to foster sustained FDI growth, its success hinges on complementary macroeconomic policies, strong regulatory frameworks, and active measures to mitigate inflation and currency risk. Accordingly, the study provides policy recommendations aimed at creating a more stable and predictable investment climate, including strengthening monetary policy coordination, enhancing exchange rate forecasting tools, and building institutional capacity to manage external shocks effectively."}}

This market standard, however, is fundamentally tied to the Black-Scholes model, burdening it with model-dependency and notoriously complex no-arbitrage conditions. We propose a paradigm shift. This paper introduces the implied strike, a new market primitive that is both simpler and more general. We establish the theoretical foundation of this new framework, connecting it to monotone transport theory and the economic concept of convex order. The core results are twofold: first, we derive simple, local no-arbitrage conditions that stand in stark contrast to the complex, non-local constraints of implied volatility. Second, we prove a direct, model-free generalization of Lee's celebrated moment formula, linking price asymptotics to tail risk without reference to any specific model. These theoretical advantages lead to powerful practical applications, including robust calibration techniques and a consistent methodology for pricing exotic and earlyexercise options. By freeing ourselves from the constraints of implied volatility, we arrive at a more elegant and powerful framework for understanding option prices and risk. \n<br>"}}

Focusing on governance, the book explores the potential of AI to meet the SDGs within the categories of the rule of law, criminal justice, and ethics and access to justice. Highlighting that the SDGs are a problematic human rights frame and have been critiqued as ignoring some major global disconnects when it comes to areas such as trade, the book explores the potential for the application of AI to the achievement of the SDGs to be equally problematic, and considers issues of techno-colonialism, information deficits and fundamental technological dependencies which could be exacerbated when AI meets the SDGs.

This is an instance of a core problem in causal inference: estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) using panel data. Existing methods either do not utilize the underlying structure in the panel data or do not accommodate the general vendor addition patterns in the HIP data. We propose the Panel Clustering Estimator (PaCE), a novel method that first partitions observations into disjoint clusters with similar treatment effects using a regression tree, and then leverages the (assumed) low-rank structure of the panel data to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) for each cluster. Our theoretical results establish the convergence of the resulting estimates to the true treatment effects. Computational experiments with semi-synthetic data show that PaCE achieves superior accuracy for ATE and HTE estimation compared to existing approaches. This performance was achieved using a regression tree with no more than 40 leaves, making PaCE both more accurate and interpretable. Applying PaCE to HIP data, we discern the heterogeneous impacts of vendor additions on program utilization across different regions of MA. These findings provide valuable insights for future budget planning and for identifying which MA ZIP codes to target with vendor additions."}}

Objective: This study investigates the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on life expectancy in Nigeria, Egypt, and Algeria by exploring the effects of various pandemic-related indices. Methods: The study employed a GARCH (1,1) model to analyze the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on life expectancy. The data set consisted of daily Covid-19 indices, including the Covid Index (CIX), Medical Index (MIX), Vaccine Index (VIX), and Uncertainty Index (UIX), spanning from 31 December 2019 to 28 April 2021. Life expectancy (LEX) was measured using life expectancy as a percentage of the total population. Control variables included government health expenditure (GEXH) as a percentage of GDP and per capita income (PCI). Results: The findings indicate that the Covid-19 pandemic had significant adverse effects on life expectancy in Nigeria, Egypt, and Algeria. The pandemic's negative impact on life expectancy was robust across all indices, underscoring the detrimental effects of the crisis on public health in these countries. Conclusion: The Covid-19 pandemic has posed a serious threat to life expectancy in Nigeria, Egypt, and Algeria, highlighting the need for policies aimed at improving living standards and extending life expectancy. Governments should prioritize enhancing public health infrastructure and living conditions to mitigate future health crises' long-term impacts."}}

Despite double-digit unlevered yields, investors who enter today’s bilateral, unitranche deals confront lockups of five to seven years and typically concede discounts of 10–15% for the few secondary exits that do clear.

Using the case of ore-sand-a type of manufactured sand that can be produced as a by-product of metal ore mining-this paper quantifies profitability across various adoption scenarios. The dynamic economic model is calibrated to a representative large-scale iron-ore operation covering a 30-year mine's life and uses Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the different adoption scenarios. Simulations indicate significant economic incentives for ore-sand adoption though with substantial heterogeneity across factors such as the costs of waste management and rehabilitation costs, recovery rates, processing efficiency, and output prices. The findings highlight that, while ore-sand profitability is subject to important uncertainty in costs and final demand, cost savings in tailings waste management and mine rehabilitation from the primary operation provide robust economic incentives for adoption."}}

The model evaluates alternative discount rates and multiple grid decarbonization trajectories to capture spatial heterogeneity and temporal uncertainty. Results show that uniform federal incentives are economically inefficient: in clean-grid states EVs merit positive subsidies, while in carbon-intensive states the optimal subsidy is often negative, and hybrid vehicles can outperform EVs on a total lifecycle emissions and a theoretical optimal subsidy basis. In some cases, efficient ICEV models remain competitive in some states under current conditions. The framework is transparent and replicable, providing a basis for regionally differentiated incentives tied to measured grid carbon intensity and for coordinating vehicle policy with power-sector decarbonization.

This study proposes the Cross-Platform Differential Feedback Method, a systematic approach to mitigate echo chamber effects by distributing adapted versions of the same research idea across multiple social media platforms with varying audience demographics, content norms, and algorithmic structures. We detail the method's key steps, including platform selection, AI-assisted content preparation using the MindStream framework, timing and sequencing of dissemination, and both qualitative and quantitative feedback analysis. Our approach emphasizes identifying new topics from negative or divergent comments, integrating these into iterative idea refinement, and leveraging platform diversity to improve idea robustness. Advantages over traditional publishing include faster feedback cycles, broader inclusivity, and richer real-world engagement. We conclude by discussing limitations-platform selection risks, researcher well-being, and varying audience expertise-and propose future research directions to optimize cross-platform strategies for more balanced, high-quality scholarly discourse."}}

While the provision prohibits decisions based solely on automated processing that produce legal or similarly significant effects, and establishes additional safeguards when \"special categories\" of personal data are involved, its literal interpretation may fail to prevent algorithmic discrimination. The paper argues that the protection offered by Article 22(4) GDPR is insufficient when machine learning models generate proxy variables that correlate indirectly with sensitive data, thereby producing discriminatory outcomes even in the absence of explicitly protected categories. It advocates for a rights-based and teleological interpretation of Article 22(4), one that encompasses both direct and indirect inferences about protected attributes. Such an approach better aligns with the fundamental rights framework of the GDPR and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, strengthening the provision's capacity to safeguard individuals against algorithmic discrimination."}}

However, their implementation in large classroom settings, particularly in resourceconstrained contexts like Bangladeshi colleges, remains underexplored. This phenomenological qualitative study investigates the challenges teachers face when integrating active learning strategies in overcrowded classrooms and examines adaptive solutions they employ to overcome these barriers. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion with eight college instructors from two institutions in Feni district, Bangladesh, where classrooms frequently exceed 200 students. Findings reveal significant challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, time constraints, difficulties in monitoring participation, and students' heterogeneous skill levels. Teachers also reported systemic issues such as limited institutional support, insufficient training, and rigid curricular demands. Despite these obstacles, instructors developed context-specific strategies, such as reorganizing seating into collaborative clusters, leveraging social media and flipped classrooms for pre-class engagement, integrating low-cost digital tools (e.g., projectors and WhatsApp), and employing peer-assisted learning to manage large groups. The study highlights the critical role of teacher agency in adapting active learning methods, emphasizing the need for localized professional development programs and institutional reforms, such as classroom size reduction and continuous assessment integration. These findings contribute to global discourse on active learning by underscoring the interplay between pedagogical innovation and socioeconomic constraints in the Global South. Recommendations include policy interventions to enhance teacher training, infrastructure investment, and curriculum flexibility to foster sustainable active learning practices in Bangladesh's tertiary education sector."}}

Departing from the log-log linear decay commonly reported by other studies, we find a two-regime pattern: volatility declines steeply with size for small firms, but flattens for larger ones. We relate this new fact to the presence of resources misallocation as captured by imperfect correlation between size and productivity at the firm level. To explain the nexus between these two facts, we develop a stochastic model where firms face a number of risky business opportunities for which they compete. Two key features characterize this competition process. First, larger firms are more intensively exposed to competition dynamics. Second, firms with higher productivity are more likely to see business opportunities turning into positive, rather than negative, growth episodes. We analytically show that only when the correlation between firm size and productivity is lower than 1 the model is able to reproduce the volatility scaling we observed in the data. Simulations suggest that finite sample approximations of our asymptotic result are satisfactory in a reasonable portion of the parameter space. We conclude showing that in France industries populated by firms with higher correlation between size and productivity are associated with steeper average size-volatility decays consistent with the model's main prediction. Our findings suggest that the existence of resources misallocation, shaping the size-volatility relation, affects the relevance of the granularity channel in explaining aggregate fluctuations (Gabaix, 2011)."}}

Implementing a difference-indifference framework, we find a significant reduction in emission intensity, demonstrating the early-stage response of potential stakeholder firms occurring through channels of strategic management and firm innovation. The maximal reduction was observed for coal, which is a carbon-intensive fuel type. There were no significant energy intensity reductions from electricity, which is an essential energy type, and from natural gas, which is relatively less-pollutive. Among the treated industries, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, and Textile had significant intensity reductions. Decoupling analysis is adopted to inspect simultaneous reduction of carbon footprint alongside the revenue growth of companies. Further, there has been positive effects on net profit margins, in line with Porter's win-win hypothesis. As India is all-set to start actual carbon trading in its first official carbon market, the early-stage responses of firms to the policy signals is important in shaping the scheme implementation, which highlights India's efforts towards Sustainable Development Goals and net zero emission targets."}}

Across one lab experiment and two lab-in-field experiments in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (N = 643), participants were randomly assigned to an insecurity prime or control condition. The insecurity prime involved reflecting on threats from armed criminals; ambiguity aversion was measured using an incentivized Ellsberg urn task, while PsyCap was assessed via the validated CPC-12 scale. Results reveal three robust patterns. First, exposure to insecurity consistently heightened ambiguity aversion, with odds ratios ranging from 0.28 to 0.13-confirming that insecurity sharpens avoidance of the unknown. Second, insecurity significantly depleted Psychological Capital, suggesting that perceptions of political threat undermine internal psychological resources. Third, and contrary to theoretical expectations, PsyCap did not mediate the relationship between insecurity and ambiguity aversion: causal mediation analyses returned null indirect effects (ACME = 0.000; p = 1.000) across all studies. These findings challenge the view that cognitive-motivational resources like PsyCap fully explain behavioral responses under threat. Instead, the results suggest that political insecurity exerts a direct, likely affective, influence on economic decision-making, bypassing deliberative psychological mechanisms. We argue that in high-threat contexts, ambiguity aversion may reflect immediate emotional reactivity, not just degraded self-efficacy or future-oriented thinking. This insight carries implications for behavioral theory and policy: resilience-building alone may be insufficient to offset insecurity-induced distortions in economic behavior."}}

Some studies indicate that health care professionals lack empathy and understanding toward older adults. Therefore, it is essential to introduce innovative teaching strategies to improve attitudes and empathy toward older adults in future health professionals. \n<br>\n<br><b>Design</b>\n<br>\n A crossover randomised controlled trial. \n<br>\n<br><b>Methods</b>\n<br>\n A three-period crossover randomised controlled trial with an experimental group, a control group (that transitions to a delayed experimental group) was conducted on 70 nursing students after the initial 73 were allocated. A multimodal intervention was used that, in addition to geriatric nursing theory, incorporated complex age simulation suit and student-older adult interaction. Pre-test and post-test data were obtained through the Jefferson Scale of Empathy and Kogan’s Attitudes towards Older People Scale. Thus, students in the experimental group 1 received the following simulation flow: Geriatric Nursing Theory + Seminar with age simulation suit + student-older adult interaction. The students in the delayed experimental group 2 received this order: Geriatric Nursing Theory +Seminar without Age simulation suit + student-older adult interaction + Age simulation suit. \n<br>\n<br><b>Results</b>\n<br>\n Statistically significant differences were observed in both empathy (t = 3.155, p = 0.001, d = 0.782), and attitudes (t=3.256, p=0.001, d=0.803) when comparing control group scores (who only received the theoretical contents of the seminar) and experimental group 1 scores after receiving the full multimodal simulation (i.e. a seminar wearing an age simulation suit + volunteer interaction with an older adult). Regarding the order of educational strategies in the simulation flow, there were significant differences in the empathy scores found when both groups had received the full intervention. Accordingly, training with age simulation suits followed by storytelling provides better scores in empathy than in the opposite direction (t = 2.028, p = 0.048, d = 0.54). \n<br>\n<br><b>Conclusions</b>\n<br>\n The use of a multimodal intervention, implementing an age simulation suit and the narration of an older adult's life experiences (in this order), improves attitudes and empathy."}}

We elucidate how key aspects of the economy influence the existence and nature of CvdN equilibrium, including the role of consumption utilities, jurisdictional preferences, and properties of the public good production function. We show how these properties can yield equilibria with different jurisdiction structures, including the grand coalition, only singletons, or intermediate-sized jurisdictions. We also demonstrate how underlying characteristics of the economy can lead to homogenous or heterogeneous equilibrium jurisdictions, and we show possibilities for homophily, segregation, and sorting-thus drawing linkages with prior literature that has investigated these phenomena. Moreover, we find that the size of jurisdictions-and whether a public good is ultimately deemed to be \"global\" or \"local\"-is an endogenous outcome that depends jointly on the nature of jurisdictional preferences, the extent of crowding in the public good production function, and the distribution of public good preferences across the population."}}

Second, we show how a country's product concentration and diversification explain the export performance using five different proxies.

We extend the quantile and expectile functions to include interaction terms between the volatility predictor and lag of target variable, resulting in five new models combining different functional forms with interaction. We replace volatility predictors in the quantile and expectile functions with more efficient volatility measures of different frequencies and volatility estimates from the Conditional Autoregressive Range models. Furthermore, we propose alternative estimates for ES from expectile through the conversion ratio, which can be estimated parametrically or empirically. Finally, we compare and perform model selection in two applications regarding quantile and expectile of Bitcoin and Ethereum, where the ES forecast using the best model shows great adaptiveness and accuracy to observed data."}}

The CFTC argued such contracts were akin to election gambling or gaming, which is illegal in many states. Kalshi went to the courts to argue this was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law and won. 3 Other brokerages, notably Interactive Brokers and Robinhood, jumped in to reap significant revenues from the 2024 election contracts. Thereafter, it was only a matter of time and a much smaller leap for Kalshi, and others including Crypto.com and Robinhood, to offer event contracts on sporting events. 4 The financial firms offering these contracts are not licensed or approved by the states, pay no taxes to the states on these contracts and are not subject to state regulations on sports betting. <br><br>Regulatory issues for prediction markets are murky at best, considering the Supreme Court's 2018 repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) gave the power to regulate sports betting to the states.

Whether this issue ends up in the Supreme Court-or whether Congress takes action, or whether the CFTC develops new policies-remains to be seen.

The performance of recently proposed joint inference methods, which produce noticeably different error band estimates, is evaluated, and calibration routines are suggested to ensure that they achieve the intended nominal probability coverage. Two practical applications illustrate the implications of these findings: (i) within a structural vector autoregression, the fiscal multiplier exhibits error bands that are 51% to 91% wider than previous estimates, and (ii) a pseudo-out-of-sample projection exercise for inflation and gross domestic product shows that joint inference methods could effectively summarize uncertainty for forecasts as well.

It evaluates six distinct systems from free-market capitalism to Marxist socialism through an ordinal scale (1-6) that categorizes the degree of voluntary cooperation versus state domination. Challenging conventional classifications, this analysis demonstrates that modern economies, including those commonly labeled “capitalist,” are statist systems operating at varying degrees of centralized coercion, repression, and control. Most are mixed economies with Western nations in the middle range of the Scale and developing regions largely under more autocratic systems. Systems become increasingly unjust, oppressive, and dysfunctional as they drift from free-market principles. Statist models consistently produce systemic repression, economic instability, and civilizational stagnation. For Africa and the world, the message is clear: sovereignty, dignity, and prosperity require moving from statist orthodoxy toward morally grounded systems of free enterprise, sound money, and respect for natural individual rights—core principles of the Africonomics vision.\n</div>"}}

In contrast to the traditional US enforcement template, which addresses derogations of labour rights by a state that is party to a free trade agreement, the RRM operates at the level of the firm and facility. A firm that violates workers' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining can face loss of preferential terms for its exports to the US under the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) or, for repeated violations, loss of access to that market. This article explores the motivations for the policy shift, reviews the early experience with the RRM, evaluates the mechanism against its objectives, and considers its future. It begins with a brief review of the economic and political developments in the US and Mexico that led to the novel labour provisions of the USMCA and RRM. The following section turns to the early experience with the new mechanism, providing empirical information on the pattern of violations addressed and the outcomes, along with a profile of the sectors, ownership of firms, and petitioners involved. The fourth section discusses the logic and objectives of enforcing the labour obligations of a free trade agreement at the level of the firm and evaluates the RRM in those terms. The fifth section considers the prospects for continued use and possible replication of the RRM at a time of heightened uncertainty in US trade policy. The final section concludes."}}

The authors examine how well potential strategies used by firms to implement APP (collusion/coordinated competitor conduct, abuse of dominance, and deceptive marketing practices) are likely to fit within the ambit of Canada's Competition Act, particularly as recent amendments made important changes to the applicable legal frameworks. Noting that the precise ambit of the amended Act is not yet fixed, the authors argue that responding effectively to APP will require both creative interpretations of the new rules, and refined enforcement strategies and tools as competition law is adapted to a world where the incidence of algorithmic coordination and data-driven market distortions continues to increase, and with it, the erosion of consumer surplus. The submission concludes by advocating for public education, tailored enforcement guidance, and the development of consumer-side AI tools to counterbalance APP’s adverse effects on consumers and the proper functioning of competitive markets.</span>"}}

Early warning signals (EWS) are used as indicators of the likelihood of future crisis. The aim of this paper is to examine approaches to identify EWS to maximize the effectiveness of MaPs in the light of the developments of information technologies. The paper presents a comprehensive and synthetic analysis of academic work that determine effective EWS by analyzing numerical information using econometric and machine learning (ML) methods or extracting economic information from text based on deep learning (DL) techniques that may be regarded as innovative approaches to financial supervision and regulation. The results, taking into account current regulatory practices, suggest the advantages of identifying effective EWSs by machine learning approaches to analyzing numerical data, as it allows simultaneous processing of a large number of variables; and the potential for developing the application of methods for extracting economic information from textual data to determine expectations."}}

We investigate which type of information-the reliability level or the improvement cost-is more valuable to a buyer who designs incentive contracts to induce the desired supplier effort. We develop a framework to compare expected profits based on two partial asymmetric information settings: in each, the buyer observes one type of information while having only incomplete information about the other. Our analysis reveals that when product value is relatively high, information about the supplier's initial reliability is more valuable, as ensuring production success is critical for high-value products. However, when product value is moderate and the supplier has high improvement potential, the buyer is more sensitive to whether the supplier can cost-effectively enhance its reliability, making improvement cost information more valuable. We extend the base model to incorporate partial disruptions and continuous effort choices by the supplier, and find that our key insights remain robust.

This paper examines an often-overlooked factor: whether polling location (e.g., school, place of worship) influences election fraud. Combining validated fraud measures during the 2009 Afghan presidential election with a novel instrumental variable approach, we find that polling centers within schools report an 8-percentage-point lower likelihood of fraud compared to those within mosques. Two mechanisms may explain this difference. First, mosques designated as polling centers were more likely to be attacked by the Taliban, likely suppressing turnout and creating incentives for fraudulent votes through a vote-substitution channel. Second, election-related complaint data show systematic differences in voter and polling official behavior between schools and mosques. Compared to mosques, voters at schools are more willing to file complaints, complainants are more often women, and polling officials are less likely to be the subject of complaints."}}

The P.S.A.'s financial structure eschews the traditional fixed share capital, allowing for flexible equity management and distributions to shareholders. It also accepts labor and services as contributions, with shareholder rights represented by dematerialised no-par-value shares. The P.S.A. grants founders considerable autonomy in choosing a governance model and structuring shareholder rights and obligations. Consequently, the enactment of the P.S.A. may serve as a blueprint for legislative innovation in the field of company law, exerting pressure on the modernisation of other corporate forms in Poland and in Europe."}}

This paper examines Japan's fiscal position from the perspectives of the standard debt sustainability analysis and the asset pricing approaches. The findings suggest that several factors contribute to mitigate debt sustainability risks. Moreover, under favorable conditions, the present value of government debt is consistent with its current market valuation, as it accounts for the country's capacity to repay its debt relying on future primary surpluses and a reduction of its debt stock. However, as the Bank of Japan normalizes monetary policy and scales back from large-scale bond purchases, the sustainability of Japan's debt may come under increasing pressure. These findings underscore the importance of proactive fiscal adjustments to steer the economy towards long-term fiscal stability and enhanced resilience against financial shocks."}}

Using a randomized lab experiment in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, we show that priming insecurity significantly reduces the likelihood of choosing a demanding but rewarding task. Crucially, mediation analysis reveals that over 95% of this effect operates through diminished PsyCap, indicating that insecurity primarily erodes psychological resources rather than directly altering preferences. We further find that insecurity impairs task performance (increasing completion time), again mediated by PsyCap, for more insecurity also increases the importance of PsyCap. These results hold after controlling for mood, time preferences, and risk aversion. Our findings highlight insecurity as a psychological constraint on agency, reducing both motivation and effort capacity. They also suggest that interventions bolstering PsyCap could mitigate the hidden economic costs of insecurity, particularly in conflict-affected settings."}}

This article explains that, for foreclosures where the homeowner has no equity to recover, there should be another option for lenders, neighborhoods, and homeowners: a transfer foreclosure. A foreclosure where ownership is simply transferred from the homeowner to the mortgagee on a specific date, on paper, would be more appropriate for many foreclosures than the one-size-fits-few auction. This article covers the auction process, how what is functionally a transfer foreclosure already happens in three states (under the name \"strict foreclosure\" or \"optional foreclosure\"), prior reform proposals, the embarrassment, inefficiency, and undesirability of foreclosure auctions, and the benefits of a transfer foreclosure option. It also answers questions about transfer foreclosures stakeholders may have, accounts for the effect of recent legal developments, and draws from the input of practitioners throughout the country and the author's time working with thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure. It concludes with baseline statutes that can be adapted to implement the transfer foreclosure option."}}

However, labeling all individuals aged 65 and above as elderly can be misleading and inaccurate when life expectancy is increasing. Therefore, using the prospective old-age dependency ratio to define what is elderly would allow for more precise measurements and facilitate research into the impact of aging on economic growth. Our findings suggest that while a negative relationship between aging and economic growth at the global level was more prominent before 1990, this negative effect has decreased over time. Moreover, the population nearing retirement age exhibits an increasing contribution to growth. Harnessing the potential of those typically deemed old by traditional measures, yet who remain productive, could effectively bolster economic development. Additionally, we find that the impact of aging on growth varies across individual economies in the ASEAN+3 region. The accumulation of human capital and technological advancements appears to mitigate negative effect from aging, underscoring the need for economies to promote both as their populations age."}}

Our empirical model finds that banks operate with a significant negative duration gap. The model also produces predicted capital ratios that are 98% correlated with actual capital ratios.

Most rural communities also have high cases of diabetes, but there is a lack of healthcare in the community, and thus such communities are susceptible to poor disease outcomes. The study examines the relationship between predictors or moderators, i.e. income level, education, employment status, insurance coverage, and geographic isolation, and control indicator of diabetes, i.e. HbA1c levels, hospitalization, and treatment adherence, through the use of secondary data reflecting the trends reported in the public health databases, reports of census surveys, and clinical registries. The results indicate the existence of a strong positive correlation between social deprivation and poor diabetes outcomes and that those with less income and fewer education are also the most prone to manage diabetes ineffectively. There is also the issue of structural barriers like poor transportation and provider shortage that tend to worsen disparities. The paper highlights the importance of the adoption of specific policies and community-oriented measures to alleviate the social factors affecting health to control chronic conditions in underserved rural communities."}}

In the course of regulating areas such as capital, margin, stablecoins and money market funds, lawmakers specify the relative desirability of various assets, including sovereign debt. Ideally, lawmakers would calibrate these rules based on the risk these assets pose. However, in practice, calibration may account for fiscal considerations, i.e., encouraging the financial system to absorb sovereign debt. This paper explores this conflict of interest. For example, it criticizes U.S. banking regulators’ approach of applying zero risk weights to all high income OECD countries’ sovereign debt. It also questions why (a) U.S. derivatives clearinghouses have stringent collateral rules that privilege U.S. government debt, and (b) uncleared swaps are subject to relatively permissive collateral standards. Normatively, the paper makes modest suggestions towards insulating financial stability regulation from bias that may be injected on the basis of fiscal considerations.</span>"}}
