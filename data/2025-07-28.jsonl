However, computational tasks often exhibit interdependencies, which are largely overlooked in existing research. Even when dependencies are considered, the focus tends to remain on single-user scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a task offloading strategy for multi-vehicle, multi-server vehicular networks, aiming to maximize the overall system Quality of Service (QoS). First, a multi-vehicle MEC system model is constructed using Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is then employed to represent the dependency relationships among tasks, where nodes and directed edges denote subtasks and their dependencies, respectively. Finally, a task scheduling method is developed by integrating a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to optimize the system’s QoS. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline algorithms in various performance metrics, offering an effective solution to the challenge of dependency-aware task offloading in vehicular networks."}}

At the same time, edge domains must meet their own operational constraints, such as server consolidation, which –while reducing resource usage– may degrade QoE perceived by a UD. Given the highly dynamic and distributed nature of such systems, identifying a global optimal solution that balances client- and server-side requirements remains a complex challenge. To address this, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the match between user devices and edge servers by forming adaptive clusters based on two synthetic indicators: (i) the serverside utility of accepting a service request from a particular UD, and (ii) the QoE perceived and/or measured by the UD when sending a request to a specific edge domain. Our model also incorporates cooperative behavior among UDs, who share recommendations about QoE for specific services and edge domains. These recommendations are evaluated using a trust mechanism that assesses the reliability of each UD’s feedback. The proposed algorithm exploits this information to asymptotically maximize the collective utility of edge servers and UDs, which is computed on the basis of the server side utility and the QoE. We demonstrate through theoretical results that the computed solution constitutes a Nash equilibrium and that only those agents providing reliable feedback are rewarded –thus promoting trustworthy collaboration among UDs. Experimental validation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Bridging abstract theory with practice, the paper surveys conceptual approaches in futures studies—including scenario planning, trend analysis, speculative design, and strategic foresight—and examines their relevance as analytical tools for law. It argues that the legal field&apos;s traditional reliance on precedent and reactive change must give way to anticipatory governance models. In the human rights context, the article highlights a gap in forward-looking scholarship: while historical analyses of rights abound, engagements with the futures of human rights remain nascent. The core of the paper applies futures methodology to digital-era issues, illustrating how techniques like horizon scanning and participatory scenario-building can illuminate the trajectory of phenomena such as mass surveillance, algorithmic bias, and the impact of social media on democracy. Building on these insights, the article proposes a concrete futurology-based methodology for international human rights, intended to \"future-proof\" human rights—ensuring that legal protections remain robust amid fast-changing digital landscapes and beyond."}}

Data from 845 international students in Shaanxi, China, were analyzed using SEM and LSTM techniques. Findings indicate that cultural adjustment and institutional support improve scholarship satisfaction, enhancing academic success. Conversely, financial stress negatively impacts both scholarship satisfaction and learning outcomes. The study also reveals a complex relationship between academic performance and workload-balanced workloads boost satisfaction, while excessive workloads reduce performance. The research contributes theoretically by validating scholarship satisfaction as a mediator and reinforcing institutional support theories. These insights can help Chinese universities enhance international students' academic experiences through better financial aid, cultural integration, and workload management."}}

Through a qualitative analysis of 439 modified workflow files we identified seven types of conceptual changes to workflows. Next, we performed a quantitative analysis over 31K+ GitHub repositories totaling 131K+ workflow change histories and 1.1M+ workflow file versions from November 2019 to October 2023. This analysis revealed that repositories contain a median of two workflow files, and 8.4% of all workflow files are being changed every week. The changes made to workflows tend to be small, with about three-quarters containing only a single change. The large majority of the observed changes have to do with task configuration and task specification in workflow jobs. Our findings highlight the need for improved tooling to support fine-grained maintenance tasks in change-prone areas such as run, uses, and permissions. Our analysis also underscores the potential of increased automation, such as broader adoption of dependency update tools to keep reusable Actions up to date. Finally, we identify a need for better debugging and validation support."}}

However, existing federated learning methods still face two critical challenges: (1) the reliance on complex cryptographic techniques for secure data communication substantially increases computational and communication overhead; and (2) ensuring robustness against Byzantine attacks while preserving data privacy remains inherently difficult. To address these challenges, this paper proposes FedLS (Lightweight Secure Federated Learning Scheme), a novel federated learning framework that simultaneously ensures privacy preservation and Byzantine robustness while maintaining computational efficiency. Specifically, a new secure server is added to form a dual-server model, where malicious clients are accurately rejected by comparing the directional consistency and distance of model parameters of model parameters before model aggregation, and a secret sharing technique is used to split the model parameters into two parts and upload them to two servers respectively, so as to realize the secure aggregation of the models without disclosing individual model parameters. Experiments were conducted on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, verifying that the classification and recognition accuracy of models trained based on the FedLS framework is improved by 15\\% compared to LSFL, and the training time efficiency is improved by nearly 50\\%, which effectively improves the training efficiency of the models under the joint learning framework. In addition, it is also verified that FedLS is able to recognize noise, symbol flipping and its variant attacks with an accuracy of up to 100\\% and a false recognition rate of 0\\%, which is better than LSFL as well as Bulyan."}}

Unlike fixed black lists that totally prohibit certain websites, the system in place gives an administrative body the power to block access to certain websites at certain periods. In the modern architectural systems purposeful monitoring of user activity is a central feature, and the repeated attempts to enter a blocked site receive successively enhanced waiting time in order to strengthen overarching security and work-rate policies. One of the unique features found in this architecture is the controlled requesting option where users can request temporary access when they have to access the locked sites. The requests of the Internet access are filtered and approved by e-mail messages or the administrative dashboard of the system. The system does not allow exceptions to be given in anything short of a highly disciplined system. The platform has a well-designed logging and monitoring systems that keep tracks of all user activities, and provide organizations and users with extensive information on how the internet is being utilised. This service enhances the observation of security, policy observance, and online responsibility. Targeted toward corporate environments, educational institutions, and parental control applications, the system advances productivity, strengthens cybersecurity, and promotes disciplined internet engagement. By integrating intelligent scheduling, adaptive blocking, and secure access management, this invention offers a modern and effective approach to internet stewardship."}}

However, one of the key challenges in decentralized systems is the lack of a reliable mechanism to assess the trustworthiness of digital credentials issued by independent trust anchors. This paper proposes a hybrid trust assessment model that combines static claim-level scoring with dynamic behavioral trust derived from distributed network opinions. Instead of binary outcomes, the model introduces multi-level assurance tiers and dynamically adapts to context and user behavior. The model integrates Subjective Logic-based trust networks with continuous policy evaluation, which enables verifiers to make fine-grained, real-time trust decisions without centralized authorities. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal trust decay function that continuously reduces credential assurance over time, effectively closing the window for replayed or stolen credentials and aligning with zero‑trust principles. The model is implemented using a continuous policy evaluation framework and a behavioral trust engine. This work provides a scalable, interoperable foundation for trust in decentralized ecosystems and advances SSI adoption beyond issuer-centric approaches."}}

The background of this study is based on the importance of the role of student organizations as a forum for the formation of leadership character and human resource development at the university level. The approach used in this study is a quantitative approach with a survey method, where data were collected by distributing questionnaires to 120 active respondents in student organizations. Data analysis was carried out using multiple regression, Sobel mediation test, and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test the relationship between variables as a whole. The results of the study indicate that leadership has a positive and significant effect on the motivation and performance of organizational members. Motivation also has a significant effect on performance, and is statistically proven to mediate the effect of leadership on performance. The SEM model used shows good construct validity and reliability, as well as strong support for the relationship between variables. These findings support the theory of transformational leadership and the theory of expectancy motivation, which states that leaders who are able to inspire and empower their members can increase work enthusiasm and individual productivity in the organization. This study suggests that student organizations and mentoring institutions develop leadership programs that are oriented towards increasing motivation and performance, as well as creating a collaborative and inspiring organizational environment. This study also opens up space for the development of further studies with a broader scope and a mixed-method approach."}}

Current research on knowledge communities has primarily focused on exploring influential factors for predicting answer quality, neglecting a thorough examination of the deep semantic alignment between questions and answers. To address this gap, we propose a theory-driven trusted multi-view learning (TDTM) model based on the knowledge quality model (KAM) theory to improve answer quality in knowledge communities. Specifically, argument quality, source credibility and information usefulness features are learned from texts and respondents&apos; characteristics. A respondent-guided matching module is designed to capture dynamic interaction between questions and answers. A trusted multi-view fusion approach is developed to effectively reduce uncertainty in multi-view information and thus improve prediction reliability. The proposed model is validated on a real-world dataset comprising 14,126 question-answer pairs collected from Autohome.com, a large-scale product knowledge community in China. The experimental results demonstrate that the TDTM method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and explainability. Compared to the best-performing baseline model, TDTM achieves improvements of 5.73% in F1-score and 5.08% in AUC, respectively."}}

The subsidy that we examine was introduced in Italy through the 2015 Budget Law, with the goal of promoting open-ended contracts. We employ a non-linear difference-in-differences (NL-DiD) approach within a duration framework, using high-frequency, population-wide linked employer-employee administrative data from a large Italian region. Causal results on job security indicate that the subsidys protective effect is short-lived. Excess separations from subsidised jobs peak in the exact same month in which the monetary incentive expires. No long-term protective effect of the subsidy is observed regarding employment security. These results hold across a wide range of worker and firm characteristics, showing surprisingly little heterogeneity. One notable exception concerns firm size. Furthermore, the expiration of subsidies disproportionately affects workers with low human capital.Our findings suggest that hiring subsidies are not effective in promoting either job or employment security for beneficiaries and that this raises questions about the efficacy of this common and costly policy, particularly when offered unconditionally."}}

Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses are conducted to examine the relationship between three effectiveness metrics, along with investigating the influence of CSR factors driven by ESG components: Environmental, Social, Governance, and overall ESG on the IE-SE and SE-PE relationships. The study reveals (1) the negative impact of SE on PE might result in SE weaken the indirect effect of IE on PE, while IE has a significantly positive direct effect on both SE and PE. (2) Both Environmental and overall ESG factors strengthen the significantly positive IE-SE relationship, though their impact on the SE-PE relationship is insignificant. These insights underscore the nuanced moderating role of CSR practices in promoting both innovation and sustainability, suggesting that firms should adopt a long-term orientation and appropriate strategies aimed at enhancing competitiveness while supporting responsible business practices to create sustainable profits."}}

As process complexity increases, mixed-defect instances become more frequent in WBMs, highlighting the need for robust classification methods that can identify multiple defect origins. However, in real-world scenarios, single-defect WBMs are often class imbalanced, and mixed-defect WBMs lack labels due to high annotation costs, making classification particularly challenging. Therefore, we propose the first method that is capable of robustly classifying both single- and mixed-defect WBMs using only class-imbalanced single-defect training data. Our approach leverages a generalized zero-shot learning framework that classifies both seen and unseen classes by exploiting semantic information and employs a diffusion model as a generative classifier. The proposed method consists of two key components. First, a class-mixing diffusion model is designed to enhance the generation quality of underrepresented mixed and tail classes by learning from potential class combinations. Second, the classification performance achieved for seen classes is improved by using the prompt-wise attention score similarity to compare the generation processes for the training and test samples. Experiments conducted on the MixedWM38 dataset, which is commonly used in WBM classification research, demonstrate that our method achieves superior generalization performance with less overfitting to the training data and realizes significantly improved classification accuracy owing to its enhanced generation quality."}}

Even brief power disruptions due to energy crises can trigger cascadingissues, including traffic congestion, delays, accidents, and delays in emergency response vehicles,such as fire trucks and ambulances. Consequently, guaranteeing a reliable supplementary powersupply for these essential loads is becoming increasingly crucial.This study offers a comparative analysis of existing power supply solutions, including traditionalgrid connections, renewable energy systems, and hybrid configurations that incorporateenergy storage technologies. A case study focusing on traffic lights at major intersections inQazvin City demonstrates the practical application and efficacy of the proposed methods inreal-world scenarios. The investigation evaluates the performance of a solar energy systemduring short-term outages, emphasizing the impact of seasonal variations in solar radiation andambient temperature. Response strategies to planned electricity interruptions are examined, withrecommendations formulated to improve system reliability for critical loads. The results indicatethat the highest operational continuity occurs during outages around 9 AM, while capacitydiminishes at night, predominantly due to the system’s dependence on battery storage. Monthlydata projections suggest operation times of approximately 4–8 h at 50% battery charge and 5–9h at 80% charge.In this optimization problem, the mutual goals of traffic and electrical performance weresimultaneously considered as a multi-objective framework. Moreover, the optimal selection ofcandidate intersections for solar system deployment was performed using the TOPSIS method inboth the conventional and iterative modes. The iterative approach, which integrates the influenceof prior selections into subsequent decision-making, yielded higher accuracy and more consistentresults. To enhance the robustness of the analysis, a sensitivity analysiswas conducted by varyingone or two parameters simultaneously within the TOPSIS framework. This process ensured thatthe results were not only reliable but also resilient to parameter fluctuations, providing a preciseand dependable foundation for strategic decision-making in critical urban-energy applications."}}

Conventional control approaches that rely on static models with fixed parameters inherently exhibit limitations in accuracy and robustness. These limitations become particularly pronounced during unsteady-state rolling phases, including acceleration/deceleration, flying gauge control, and tension loss during shape cutting. There are significant parameter mutations at these phases. To address these challenges, this study improved the existing Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm and developed and applied a set of intelligent control frameworks of DDPG-DC combined with the delay compensation strategy. By incorporating an experience replay mechanism with delay compensation strategies, the system demonstrates enhanced dynamic response and superior disturbance rejection capabilities. Industrial field trials confirm a 24% reduction in root mean square error in the width direction of the strip (RMSE from 3.94 to 3.01 I-units) under the same rolling conditions. This advancement optimizes continuous production of thin silicon steel (thickness ≤ 0.5 mm) while maintaining flatness quality during rapid speed transitions, achieving a critical breakthrough for high-precision rolling applications."}}

This study examines how subsidies, coupled with information asymmetry between incumbent firms and new entrants, influence social welfare, firm profitability, and strategic government decisions. Through a game-theoretical model of two competing firms-an informed incumbent and an uninformed entrant-we analyze two scenarios: one where the government discloses demand information and the other one where it withholds information, prompting the entrant to infer demand from subsidy signals. Key findings reveal that entrants' ability to infer demand from subsidies correlates positively with subsidy levels, though this sensitivity diminishes under information disclosure when competition is low. Disclosure increases subsidies and enhances market promotion flexibility, yet disproportionately benefits incumbents, who leverage reduced information asymmetry, while entrants face diminished incentives to expand sales amid intensified competition. The study underscores that optimal welfare outcomes emerge under moderate competition, balancing equitable market access and efficiency. These insights highlight the critical trade-offs governments face in designing subsidy policies, emphasizing that strategic information disclosure and competition regulation are essential to maximize societal benefits while mitigating market distortions."}}

This study combines system dynamics (SD) modeling with industrial cluster theory to simulate the CEREB within PBSC, and the model&apos;s validity is verified through a case study of a PBs project. The results demonstrate that: (1) The CEREB of prefabricated component factories (CF) follows an inverted U-shape as clustering increases, with excessive clustering leading to higher carbon emissions; (2) The CEREB of transportation companies (TC) under high clustering is 2.76 times greater than under medium clustering; (3) The CEREB of project contractors (PC) is highest under medium clustering with low carbon subsidies, and is 2.73 times higher than the low clustering. Accordingly, differentiated emission reduction strategies are proposed for varying clustering scenarios, offering practical implications for PBSC stakeholders and policymakers in designing effective mitigation policies."}}

To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns.

AI plays a role in driving production efficiency, service innovation, and digital transformation in various sectors of the economy, which ultimately affects the increase in global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, the benefits of AI advancements are not evenly distributed between countries. Developed countries such as the United States, China, and European countries tend to gain greater economic benefits because they have strong digital infrastructure, high research and development investments, and skilled human resources. In contrast, many developing countries still face challenges in accessing and implementing AI optimally, which has widened the global economic growth gap. This study aims to examine how AI affects global GDP unevenly between countries and analyze the factors that cause this inequality. With a descriptive-qualitative approach based on literature studies, this study highlights the need for strategic policies, international collaboration, and technological capacity building in developing countries so that the benefits of AI can be felt more fairly and equitably at the global level."}}

The central aim is to ascertain whether these financial instruments are genuinely attracting fresh capital for environmentally beneficial projects and, more importantly, if they are delivering tangible environmental improvements. Through a meticulous review of official bond frameworks and pertinent government reports, this study addresses several pivotal questions: Who are the primary investors-are they predominantly institutional, retail, or foreign entities? How precisely are the proceeds being allocated across various eligible green initiatives, such as solar energy, sustainable building practices, or even cleaner aviation fuels? Furthermore, what measurable environmental and social outcomes, if any, can be attributed to these investments? The thesis also critically examines the concept of 'additionality' within the context of public finance, exploring whether SGrBs truly introduce new funding streams or merely re-label existing governmental expenditures on green projects. Based on these insights, the study culminates in a series of policy recommendations designed to bolster transparency, stimulate broader investor engagement, and facilitate the seamless integration of a robust green taxonomy into India's evolving sustainable finance landscape. Ultimately, this research endeavours to enrich the academic discourse by offering a nuanced perspective on the opportunities and inherent challenges associated with leveraging sovereign debt instruments to advance sustainable development in dynamic emerging economies."}}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have reshaped energy finance research and practice, but no prior study has systematically examined how these methods have been applied across the field or what value they have brought. This paper provides a comprehensive review of approximately 700 academic studies published over the past five years, analyzing the diffusion and contribution of AI techniques across the six established thematic areas proposed by Zhang et al. (2018). While machine learning models are increasingly adopted, especially in forecasting applications, and often outperform classical econometric approaches in terms of accuracy, their use remains uneven. In some cases, methodological choices are clearly adapted to the structure of the data and the objective of the study, while in others, the implementation of complex ML algorithms lacks contextual justification or interpretability. More importantly, the review highlights a major gap, namely recent approaches such as explainable AI and causal machine learning are almost entirely absent, despite their potential to enhance transparency, support causal inference, and inform energy-related financial decisions. By identifying where AI has already contributed, where it remains underused, and how it could be better integrated, the paper offers a structured and forward-looking perspective on the evolving relationship between artificial intelligence and energy finance."}}

The result demonstrates that logistic regression model, which is limited by its linear structure, performs poorly in terms of model accuracy and profitability.

Since providing low-quality products leads to both less effort and a lower cost, both nonprofits and for-profit firms will cheat. Further, providers cannot overcharge because there are no informational asymmetries about product price. The market price in “contract failure” situations will drop, forcing both nonprofits and for-profit firms to offer only the lowest quality product. Shifting to nonprofit purposes requires nonprofits to allocate part of their resources through giving, which makes some of their transactions trustworthy. However, consumers usually cannot identify trustworthy transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span>Not only will adopting the nonprofit form not make an untrustworthy provider trustworthy, but trustworthy providers are also not necessarily more likely than untrustworthy ones to take that form because it costs untrustworthy-inefficient providers even less to do so. The nonprofit form thus cannot be an effective signal of high quality.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even if nonprofits were more trustworthy, this cannot explain why nonprofits exist. It is the supply side, which only partly overlaps the “contract failure” situations, that drives the nonprofit sector. The existence of other informational-asymmetries-relieving mechanisms also reduces consumers’ demand for the nonprofit form.</span></p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In debunking the contract-failure theory, this paper will be useful for scholars examining nonprofits’ behavior and the justification for the nonprofit sector.</span><span></span>"}}

This study uses the SPAR-4-SLR Protocol, and the Theory-Context-Construct-Methods (TCCM) framework proposed by Paul and Rosado-Serrano (2019) to analyze the literature. A bibliometric analysis with Bibliometrix-R identifies leading contributors, key journals, influential countries, and thematic trends in the field. The review details the theoretical foundations, contextual settings (countries and industries), constructs (key variables), and methodological approaches employed in studies on the impact of Gen AI since its mainstream debut in November 2022. It also provides a comprehensive conceptual framework that illustrates the relationships among independent, mediating, moderating, and dependent variables, derived from existing literature. This model provides a new perspective and advances the theoretical understanding of Gen AI's role in consumer behavior research. Practical implications are also discussed for marketing professionals aiming to leverage Gen AI to enhance customer engagement. Ultimately, the review highlights promising directions for future research, serving as a foundational resource for academics and practitioners seeking to explore and contribute to this emerging field."}}

Secondly, to improve economy under dynamic load conditions, an energy management strategy based on deep deterministic policy gradients (EMS-DDPG) was designed. which minimizes equivalent fuel consumption and state of charge difference (between actual and reference) as the target. Finally, based on the expected acceleration of the MPC-EC, the interaction between MPC-EC and EMS-DDPG was realized, and then a MOOCS was formed. The MPC path tracking and power following energy management strategy was adopted as a comparison strategy. The results showed that the MOOCS could effectively reduce the tractor&apos;s path tracking deviation while improving its economy when compared with the comparison strategy under dynamic path changes and dynamic load conditions. The absolute average error of the lateral deviation was reduced by 38.46%, the absolute average error of the heading angle deviation was reduced by 11.11%, and the equivalent fuel consumption was reduced by 11.64%, compared with the comparison strategy."}}

We conducted a path-analysis of a moderated multiple-mediation regression model using the PROCESS macro. Our sample included 16,557 participants.

However, increasing collaboration across routes has intensified competition and reduced service differentiation, highlighting the need to understand how distinct routing strategies influence network structures and emergent system performance. In this study, we examine the Multiplex Global Liner Shipping Network (mGLSN) by integrating detailed service route data from the world’s top 20 carriers, modeling each carrier as an independent layer. We introduce a novel role-to-role connectivity profile identification method to uncover the structural patterns of individual Carrier Shipping Networks (CSNs). Our analysis shows that while most carriers adopt hub-and-spoke configurations, their aggregation results in a Global Liner Shipping Network (GLSN) characterized by a mixed “core-of-hubs” and “clustered-periphery” topology. By clustering carriers based on their connectivity profiles, we identify distinct strategic groups that align with market positioning and performance outcomes: first-tier carriers dominate the global backbone, second-tier carriers enhance inter-regional connectivity, and smaller carriers operate as localized feeders. These differentiated network profiles underscore the strategic value of tailored network designs. By leveraging multiplex network modeling and role-based connectivity analysis, we provide new insights into how carrier-level strategies collectively shape the structure of the GLSN. Our findings offer managerial implications for service differentiation and competitive positioning within the global liner shipping industry, and contribute empirical evidence of self-organizing principles in real-world complex systems, illuminating the multifaceted nature of global network formation."}}

The results show that firms with higher level of digital transformation can obtain greater excess returns in the stock market. This excess return comes from the uncertainties brought by R&D investment due to digital transformation, which has provided the market with a certain level of risk premium. This premium not only arises from improvements in the fundamental aspects of the firm, but is also driven by investor sentiment and expectations. Firms with higher level of digitalization are able to effectively transfer R&D capitalization to stable intangible assets by effectively reducing technology uncertainty, which eventually improves  profitability."}}

To enable accurate and robust identification of BIL under long-term monitoring scenario, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines influence line identification under asynchronous data and unknown train parameters with statistical analysis of long-term monitoring data. Firstly, a real-time train parameter identification method is developed based on wheel detection sensor signal to estimate critical train parameters. Secondly, a Bayesian optimization-based load-response spatiotemporal synchronization approach is developed to align train load with bridge response by optimizing a hybrid objective function composed of three physical criteria. This process simultaneously optimizes the train entry time and the regularization parameter, improving the accuracy and efficiency of BIL identification. Finally, a kernel density estimation-based statistical method is proposed to extract a representative long-term BIL that is robust to measurement noise and operational variability. Long-term SHM data collected from a steel truss railway bridge is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that across different train types, the maximum overall relative error of identified BILs remains below 10%, and the peak relative error remains below 1%. Parameter analysis reveals that under current operating conditions, axle load errors have little influence on the identification accuracy. Furthermore, these results confirm the reliability and robustness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its potential for practical engineering applications."}}

Although recent research has explored various deep-learningbased approaches for tree counting, detection, and crown classification, detailed crown segmentation to detect disease symptoms remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose the first integration of DeepForest for oil palm tree detection and Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for precise crown segmentation using drone imagery.

This book develops and significantly elaborates on the concept of the Tragedy of the Accounting Commons, as well as articulating innovative solutions to the tragedy of the financial accounting standards setting commons. As a solution, it suggests the decentralization of the accounting standards setting process to the 50 US state level commons, and the empowerment of the commoners in the process of accounting standards setting. It proposes two complementary conceptual models for financial accounting standards setting, one at the federal level (Model 1), and the other at the state level (Model 2). The book proposes 50 elected accounting standards setting bodies to reflect the preferences of the 50 commons in setting the accounting standards as compared to the current centralized, top-down approach of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It also proposes a Special Accounting Adjudication Court(s) to speedily resolve the conflicts between the accounting regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and its registrants. In short, it envisions a major point of departure from the way that accounting standards have been set in the US to date.<br><br>\n  The book also addresses the institutional reconfiguration of the public-private sector balance as mandated by the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. While the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) remain the exclusive domain of FASB, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) pronounced by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have gained considerable legitimacy abroad. Although there are convergence initiatives by the two private sector accounting standards setting organizations (FASB and IASB), it is uncertain as to whether there will be a total convergence between the two sets of standards (GAAP and IFRS).

We find that public transfer of equity improves the investment efficiency of MSMEs. Further analysis shows that public transfer of equity mainly promotes the investment efficiency of MSMEs by the improved governance mechanism rather than the improved financing mechanism. Specifically, public transfers mainly improve overinvestment and reduce new investment in MSMEs, and this promotion effect is more pronounced in MSMEs with weak financing constraints and poor governance. Evidence from the tax avoidance suggests that enhanced regulation due to public transfers of equity is unlikely to be the source of governance enhancement in MSMEs. Overall, this study provides reference for the development of emerging capital market and resource allocation in MSMEs by revealing the sources of inefficient investment in MSMEs that are different from those in mature enterprises and the positive role of capital markets in guiding investment in MSMEs."}}

Along the same lines, advanced customer information has become an increasingly reliable predictor of corporate stock returns. Specifically, we propose a mediated moderation model in which customer concentration moderates the predictive effect of customer stock returns, where this moderating effect is mediated by investor attention. Using panel data from Chinese A-share listed manufacturing firms between 2017 and 2023, we empirically test our model. The results show that customer stock returns significantly predict company stock returns. Furthermore, higher customer concentration strengthens this predictive relationship, but only when it attracts sufficient investor attention. These findings highlight the importance of customer-related market signals in investment decision-making and suggest that investor attention plays a crucial role in translating customer performance into firm valuation in capital markets."}}

This paper presents a comprehensive dataset that includes genotyping data for eight serotonergic and dopaminergic gene variants in a non-clinical sample, along with psychometric measures, environmental data, and responses to a representative set of economic games commonly used in behavioral and experimental economics. The games follow the standard one-shot, anonymous, incentivized, and randomized design, and participants' beliefs are also elicited and incentivized. As responses to these games are widely recognized as good proxies for actual behavior, this dataset may provide valuable insights for researchers aiming to design and test specific hypotheses about the genetic basis of behavior in economic settings."}}

However, the absence of unified evaluation standards and inconsistent testing procedures for compressive strength of hollow concrete masonry prisms (HCMPs) limits its reliable and precise design. This study proposes an integrated experimental–computational framework to address these challenges. First, 120 mortar specimens with four geometries (70 mm cube, 50 mm cube, 100 mm × 200 mm cylinder, and 160 mm × 40 mm × 40 mm prism) were tested to investigate the effect of shape on compressive strength. A back-propagation neural network model for mortar (BPNN-m), incorporating specimen geometry, successfully normalized mortar strengths across shapes, achieving a high prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.974). Second, a database of 148 HCMP compressive tests was established. Using three input parameters: the unified compressive strength of block, mortar and height-to-thickness ratio of prisms, three neural network models—BPNN, genetic algorithm-based BP (GABP), and particle swarm optimization-based BP (PSOBP)—were developed and compared. The PSOBP model demonstrated superior predictive performance, with R2 = 0.900 and the lowest RMSE, MAE, MAPE and IAE among all models. Third, comparisons with existing empirical formulas showed that conventional models tend to underestimate compressive strength of HCMP, while PSOBP predictions aligned more closely with experimental results. Finally, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented to provide engineers with a practical and efficient tool for HCMP compressive strength prediction. The proposed framework offers improved accuracy, adaptability, and potential for HCMP future design standard revision."}}

Its ubiquitous presence is evident in applications ranging from personalised shopping recommendations to music creation. AI, a machine-based system that was designed to mimic human cognitive function, makes recommendations, predictions, and other outputs for a given set of human-defined objectives. The creation and protection of AI, along with AI-generated work, intersect with IPR. An individual whose intellect is behind the creation of AI is granted the exclusive right to utilise their creations. However, the ownership of AI-generated works remains uncertain, raising questions about AI's ability to legally 'create'. This ambiguity is particularly evident in India, where statutory regulations governing AI are yet to be established. Canada, for example, granted copyright protection to RAGHAV, an AI tool that created a painting, whereas that application was rejected in the USA and India. Since AI lacks personhood, it undermines human creators who invest time, effort, and emotions in their work if ownership is granted. Instead, IP rights should be given to human who uses their creative skills to innovate with AI. So, AI should be given recognition and not ownership and authorship. This paper critically examines the intersection of AI and IPR, evaluating existing legal frameworks, challenges, and the implications of granting or denying AI an authorship right. By analysing international perspectives and legal trends, it seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI's place in intellectual property law."}}

As the world&apos;s second-largest economy, China not only has a large scale of foreign investment and foreign capital attraction, but also is the world&apos;s largest carbon dioxide emitter. Therefore, how China adjusts global resource allocation through carbon emission trading policies is of great theoretical and practical significance. This study selects the panel data of 28 provinces and cities in China from 2006 to 2020, and uses the difference-in-differences (DID) method to empirically analyze the impact of carbon emission policies on OFDI and IFDI. The results show that the carbon emission trading policy has a significant promoting effect on both OFDI and IFDI. However, this policy has no significant impact on the eastern region, while it has a significant promoting effect on OFDI in the central region and IFDI in the western region. Moreover, the rationalization and upgrading of industrial structure play a regulatory role in the impact of carbon emission policies on OFDI and IFDI. This finding provides new evidence for studying the impact of carbon emission trading policies on global resource allocation, and also provides valuable policy implications for China and other countries when implementing carbon emission trading policies."}}

Employing a staggered difference-indifferences strategy, I find that HSR connectivity significantly and persistently reduces highway congestion: congested road length declines by 5.8% and a congestion delay index based on travel speed decreases by 6.7%. Mechanism analysis reveals substantial modal substitution from intercity road passenger transport to rail, while freight traffic in rail remains largely unchanged. The effect is strongest in cities where highways are located farther from population centers and serve primarily long-distance travel. The results provide a context-specific test of \"Fundamental Law of Road Congestion\" (Down's law) and indicate that infrastructure-induced congestion effects may vary in settings where highways primarily serve long-distance, inelastic travel demand."}}

However, the environmental impacts of titanium smelting, particularly on soil geochemical characteristics and surrounding environment quality, remain poorly understood. This study systematically investigated the distribution patterns and sources of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in soil at an abandoned titanium smelter, utilizing integrated mineralogical characterization and receptor modeling analysis. The results revealed pronounced spatial heterogeneity in PTE distribution and mineral assemblages. Elevated Ti concentrations, which were strongly linked to ilmenite-rich mineral phases, and sulfuric acid leakage were the primary contributors to environmental burdens in the titanium smelting area. Chronic soil acidification exacerbated the dissolution of host minerals, thereby enhancing mineral liberation and potential mobility of Cd, Co, Pb, and Zn. Ilmenite, barite, and gypsum emerged as key titanium smelting-affected indicative minerals, underscoring their dual role as environmental burdens and potential resources. Contrastingly, cross-site pollution inputs led to elevated As, Cd, Pb, and Zn levels in non-smelting soil, as evidenced by transportation-related enrichment of hematite, mullite, hemimorphite, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite. This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of environmental impact of titanium smelting activities on site soil quality and emphasizes the cross-site pollution, offering valuable insights for remediation and sustainable redevelopment of abandoned titanium smelting sites."}}

However, there is limited evidence on how public health authorities determine which vaccines to reimburse, how long it takes to decide, and how vaccines are procured. Methods: First, we describe public vaccine assessment and reimbursement procedures in Canada. Next, we examine the public funding status of each vaccine approved for use in Canada in the last 25 years. For funded vaccines, we calculate timelines from market authorization to national recommendations and public funding.Results: 115 vaccines were approved in Canada between 1996-2020. Of these, 86% belonged to vaccine classes that are currently publicly funded in at least one Canadian province. On average, national recommendations for public reimbursement of new vaccines are issued 22 months after vaccine approval, and 10 months for first-in-class vaccines. For public program implementation, there is on average a 31-month lag (range: 4-61) between approval and first provincial listing for vaccines. There is also marked interprovincial variations in the uptake of new vaccines, with average listing times ranging from 29-66 months. Time-to-adoption also varied by the age group for which the vaccine is targeted, as well as before and after the implementation of the National Immunization Strategy in 2004.Conclusions: The findings of this study point to an opportunity in Canada to improve access time and reduce disparities in access to vaccines. Future studies should seek to identify the root causes of current delays and disparities, and develop frameworks to increase timely access to vaccines."}}

However, accurately predicting syngas composition remains challenging due to inherent complexity and nonlinearity of the process. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis between conventional process simulators-based models (Aspen Plus), namely the thermodynamic equilibrium (TEM), restricted thermodynamic (RTM), and kinetic (KM) modelling approaches, and machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of the syngas composition. Using 208 experimental data points compiled from 20 published studies covering various feedstocks and gasification conditions in bubbling fluidized bed gasifiers, the performance of the models was evaluated after extensive data preprocessing. Among several ML algorithms evaluated, the neural network (NN) delivered the lowest average root mean square error in syngas mol fraction predictions (0.0174), outperforming RTM (0.0966), KM (0.1378), and TEM (0.1470). To explore input–output relationships beyond interpolation, a conditional generative adversarial network generated synthetic data, which served as the basis for sensitivity and interpretability analyses. The NN, acting as a surrogate model, was paired with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to quantify the effects and nonlinear interactions of key features on syngas yields providing actionable insights for process optimization."}}

Furthermore, national targets relevant at the local level are spatially disaggregated to estimate corresponding municipal targets. The analysis reveals that, of the 110 national measures, 34 identify municipalities as responsible actors, yet only 21 are reflected in Vitoria-Gasteiz’s plan. In addition, 14 local measures align with national ones despite no explicit national assignment of local responsibility, while six local measures have no equivalent in the national plan. Disaggregated targets reveal that the local targets are, on average, over 50% less ambitious than national expectations. The case study findings highlight a potential significant gap in vertical coordination, suggesting that stronger integration of local authorities in national climate action planning is essential for achieving aligned and effective climate action."}}

Despite increasing interest in assessing progress toward sustainability, no indicator framework exists for comprehensively assessing and comparing sustainable development across megacities. This study introduces a multi-indicator Megacity Sustainability Index (MSI) that benchmarks sustainability conditions for the 42 world’s megacities (32 established; 10 emerging). Four research questions guided this study: (i) Could a subset of freely accessible, common indicators be used to formulate a simple, robust index that captures the core realms of sustainable development– environment, social, and economic– in megacities? (ii) Do spatial patterns of development emerge based on the MSI? (iii) What statistical associations exist between the MSI, four key global change metrics, and the corrective measure? (iv) What defines the development progress of thriving megacities versus lagging ones? The MSI was created using an 11 sub-metric optimum, including a novel corrective measure metric, to represent the tripartite of sustainability. MSI values ranged from 24 (Nanjing) to 79 (Paris), with no cities scoring in the “very poor” or “very good” categories. Other high performing cities included London, Tokyo, New York, and Osaka; other low performers were Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou-Shenzhen, Lagos, and Lahore. MSI positively correlated with income, education, healthcare access, and infrastructure density, and negatively with population density and growth. The MSI is not simply an assessment tool- it is a prototype for a broader shift toward global-level systems thinking in sustainable urbanization. As global challenges intensify, progress toward sustainability will be shaped not only within cities but through them."}}

Exploring how it affects the environmental performance of heavily polluting enterprises is of great significance for practicing high-level environmental protection. Innovatively combining four-party evolutionary game analysis and econometric test methods, this paper explores the impact and mechanism of voluntary environmental regulation on the environmental performance of heavily polluting enterprises from both theoretical and empirical dimensions. The research findings are as follows: (1) The implementation of voluntary environmental regulation can effectively improve the environmental performance of heavily polluting enterprises, but its effect depends on the synergy of multiple parties. (2) Local ecological environment bureaus strengthen the regulatory intensity and enhance the incentive and disciplinary mechanisms to establish institutional constraints. Media exposure forms information constraints by optimizing the communication mechanism and strengthening the response of environmental issues. Both of them enhance the effectiveness of voluntary environmental regulation and promote the improvement of the environmental performance of heavily polluting enterprises. Strict regulation by local ecological environment bureaus and the exposure by media forms the key institutional guarantee and external driving force respectively for the effective operation of voluntary environmental regulation. (3) Heavily polluting enterprises establish internal constraints by increasing environmental protection investment and raising pollution control costs, which provides fundamental support and serves as the core endogenous driving force to promote environmental performance. (4) In contrast, voluntary environmental regulation enhance public trust in heavily polluting enterprises through the mechanism of information disclosure and reputation linkage. This restructures the logic of public reporting participation and weakens the monitoring motivation. The public tends to adopt a non-reporting strategy, which plays a relatively limited role in the process of voluntary environmental regulation influencing the environmental performance of heavily polluting enterprises. This research provides theoretical support and practical basis for enhancing the environmental performance of heavily polluting enterprises and achieving high-level environmental protection."}}

This study investigated associations between urinary pesticide biomarkers and EF in the CapSA cohort.MethodsData from 445 participants (mean age: 10.6 years; 55.3% male) were analysed. EF was assessed using three Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) subtests: the Multitasking Test (MTT, cognitive flexibility), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP, inhibitory control), and Spatial Working Memory (SWM, visuospatial working memory). Average levels of 13 pesticide biomarkers—spanning insecticides (organophosphates, pyrethroids), fungicides (dithiocarbamates, triazoles, succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors), and herbicides (phenoxy acids)—were calculated from two spot urine samples collected in 2017 and 2019. Associations between specific gravity-adjusted, log10-transformed biomarker-levels (ng/mL) and EF z-scores were estimated using multivariate linear regression, adjusting for agricultural setting, child and maternal characteristics, and household factors.ResultsMost biomarkers were detected in over half of samples; 3,5,6-trichloro-2-psyridinol (TCPy) and 3-phenoxybenzoic (3-PBA) acid were nearly ubiquitous. Higher average levels of TCPy (β=–0.14; 95%CI: -0.27, -0.01) and 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol (BCP,–0.08; -0.15, -0.02) were associated with poorer cognitive flexibility. Higher average levels of TCPy (–0.18; -0.31, -0.05), BCP (–0.08; -0.14, -0.01), cis-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (cis-DCCA,–0.15; -0.31, 0.00), and 4-Hydroxy-Pyrimethanil (OH-P; –0.09; -0.16, -0.03) were associated with poorer inhibitory control.

Although various frequency-domain methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, effectively capturing stable HF textures remains challenging. Inspired by recent insights into frequency-domain analysis, we introduce Fre-VA, a novel frequency-aware Variational Autoencoder designed explicitly to address the spectral bias problem in SISR. In contrast to conventional methods, Fre-VA explicitly maintains separate processing streams for LF and HF features throughout the network. By leveraging full-frequency images as bridges, the proposed framework learns the joint correlation distribution between LF and HF components instead of directly regressing unpredictable HF textures. Experimental evaluations on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fre-VA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving the reconstruction fidelity of high-frequency details. This work presents a promising step toward robust, frequency-balanced super-resolution models capable of reliable high-frequency restoration."}}

Determining the optimal number of neurons, their center vectors, and radial function widths remains a challenging task for these networks. This study introduces a novel approach, named RAD-SOM, that combines the strengths of RBFNNs with the mapping and visualization capabilities of self-organizing maps. The proposed method offers an efficient solution for classifying, mapping, and visualizing data patterns in feature space. By utilizing a growing Self-Organizing Map (SOM) framework and adaptive parameter tuning inspired by parameterless SOMs, the proposed method dynamically adjusts the network structure while enhancing classification accuracy and interpretability. The proposed approach is evaluated against several benchmark datasets. It surpasses traditional SOM-based classifiers and standard RBFNNs in classification performance and feature space visualization, presenting a robust, efficient, and transparent solution for complex data analysis tasks."}}

While existing proxy-based embedding methods represent each class with a single prototype, they struggle to reflect diverse intra-class structures, especially in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning framework called Variation-Aware Proxy Learning, which introduces a representative proxy to encode shared class semantics and multiple variation vectors to capture fine-grained intra-class variations. These components are integrated through a factorized similarity score, enabling more expressive and discriminative embedding structures. To further enhance learning in ambiguous regions, we introduce focal modulation and design a new Compositional Similarity Loss composed of attraction and repulsion terms that adaptively amplify the contribution of hard examples. Our method is model-agnostic and requires no additional inference-time cost. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation benchmarks—Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff10k, and iSAID—and diverse backbones including CNNs and Transformers, demonstrate consistent improvements in mIoU and boundary precision, particularly in challenging regions with high intra-class variability."}}

A disability may raise the time cost of all activities; of somemaking them differentially less worth doing; or it may make switching activities more costly.

These explanations describe our findings based on non-working ATUS 2008-22 respondents ages 70+, 32 percent of whom self-assess a disability. Data from the Polish Time Use Survey, where disability is medically certified, show similar results; and they demonstrate the same loss of variety over multiple days. Remarkably similar basic results are found using homogenized British, Canadian, French, Spanish, and Italian time-diaries. Overall, a mobility/physical disability leads an otherwise identical person to engage in over 10 percent fewer activities on a typical day. The lost variety represents extra costs equivalent in data from six countries to over twice the average annual income among older individuals in the country."}}

To address potential endogeneity, we employ the predicted class size with a cap as an instrumental variable for the actual class size. Utilizing rich panel data on Japanese primary school students, our findings indicate a positive and robust average effect of class-size reductionon mathematics test scores. Furthermore, we find that classes with high-ability classmates benefit even more from class-size reduction in terms of language test scores. The effect of class-size reduction on mathematics test scores is found to depend positively on the ability of the lowest-achieving student in a class. Additionally, classes with a higher proportion of female students tend to benefit more from class-size reduction. Our results lend support to the theoretical framework proposed by Lazear (2001)."}}

The labor market is modeled as being subject to multiple shocks at any one time. Using VAR, we find that migrant labor is, in part, endogenously determined by aggregate demand and supply along with an exogenous component. Using historical decompositions which decompose both the error terms and, novelly, the constant terms into their structural parts, we show that the migration shock accounts for most of the change in migration share and has  a significant negative effect on native wage growth, particularly in unskilled sectors.  However other contemporaneous shocks have offsetting positive associations between immigration and native wages, whoe effects differ across sectors"}}

To address this question, we present novel empirical evidence on lending practices across all euro area countries, using AnaCredit data covering nearly seven million new loans issued to non-financial corporations in 2022–2023. We document substantial variation in (a) the prevalence of fixed- vs floating-rate loans, (b) rate fixation periods, and (c) reference rates. This variation results in lending rates being exposed to different segments of the risk-free rate yield curve which, in turn, influence their sensitivity to monetary policy changes. We show that loans linked to shorter-maturity risk-free rates experience more pronounced monetary pass-through. Importantly, this effect is not purely mechanical, as part of the effect is offset by adjustments in the premium, revealing previously less-explored heterogeneity in the pass-through to lending rates."}}

We refer to the resulting equilibrium in this repeated automaton game with stochastic commitment as the stochastic commitment equilibrium (SCE). We show that the classical folk theorem no longer holds in this setting. We fully characterize the set of SCE payoffs when players are sufficiently patient and the probability of commitment is sufficiently small. We show that stochastic commitment restricts the range of equilibrium outcomes relative to standard repeated games and could even lead to a unique prediction in some games. Our framework offers new insights into how commitment frictions shape long-run strategic behaviors."}}

One human alteration to the phosphorus-cycle is phosphate rock mining. Mining can lead to widespread dust emissions. Dust collection near a phosphorus mine in the Ashley National Forest of northeastern Utah has shown dust-phosphorus concentrations more than four times that of other regional samples. This suggests that mining emissions may alter the natural phosphorus loading of the soils in the National Forest through dust deposition; however, no research has been done to identify the abundance and range of mine-attributable phosphorus enrichment in the soils surrounding phosphate mining activities. The combined geospatial and geochemical approach of this study shows that surface soil phosphorus concentrations were found to be enriched above naturally occurring levels up to 8 km from mining activity (enrichment factor > 1.5), with the most significant enrichment occurring within the first 4 km (enrichment factor > 2). On average, surface phosphorus concentrations were significantly enriched by 25% within 8 km of phosphorus mining activity. Observed phosphorus enrichment was positively correlated with the presence of fluorapatite in the soil, the primary phosphorus-mineral extracted from the nearby mine. Further, bioavailable phosphorus was also higher for the soils that were enriched in phosphorus. This study shows that fugitive emissions associated with the surface mining of phosphate rock are a significant source of phosphorus enrichment in subalpine soils."}}

The quantity/intensity isotherm and K release were used to evaluate the dynamics of K in loam-and clay-textured soil types developed from highly weathered parent materials in Western Australia (WA). Twenty-one soil types with a wide range of properties were collected from 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depths on farmland in WA. The equilibrium activity ratio of K+ varied from 0.1 ´ 10-3 to 45.6 ´ 10-3 (mol L-1)1/2 and was significantly higher in surface soils than subsurface soils. The labile K (KL) ranged from 0.03 to 2.18 cmol/kg, and the contributions of non-specifically held K towards KL were > 50% in surface soils but lesser in subsoils. The potential buffering capacity (PBCK) ranged from 5.4 to 185 cmol kg-1 (mol L-1)-1/2 and was significantly correlated with soil effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), pH and clay content. It can be predicted by ECEC as PBCK = 6.78 + 3.72 ECEC (R2 = 0.95). The cumulative amounts of K released after 213 h ranged from 27 to 833 mg/kg, with a rapid release of K up to 22 h followed by a gradual release until the end. In conclusion, most soils, especially surface soils, had adequate K availability for crop production but it is vulnerable to losses and depletion. Given the overall low ECEC and PBCK, split or delayed K applications are recommended, alongside practices that enhance K buffering capacity in WA soils."}}

Results demonstrate that the CNN-LSTM network effectively corrected both the zonal (U) and meridional (V) components of the current, with more significant improvements observed in the V component. The neural network consistently reduced RMSE, bias, and increased Pearson correlation, outperforming a benchmark linear regression model.

In Malawi, crop production is predominantly reliant on rainfall, making it vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. This study evaluates the irrigation potential and crop production trends in the Diamphwe River Basin, a key agricultural watershed, using remote sensing and soil analysis. Sentinel-2 data, maize production records from the Lilongwe Agricultural Development Division (ADD), and field surveys conducted at 15 randomly selected points within a 2 km buffer on either side of the river were utilised in the study. Findings indicate that irrigated maize exhibits higher productivity than rainfed maize, suggesting that harnessing irrigation could serve as a suitable alternative to the unreliable rainfed production in the basin, particularly within the 100-1000 m buffer zones that have greater irrigation potential. Kabwazi EPA accounted for 29% and 33% of the basin’s irrigable land in 2017 and 2024, respectively, due to its strategic positioning within the basin. The riparian zone displays medium hydraulic conductivity (HC), indicating suitable soils (luvisol) for infiltration, pollutant removal, and groundwater recharge, which are essential for sustaining river flow. Despite increased productivity, the impact of irrigation on maize remains minimal due to low participation by large-scale farmers and insufficient extension services, as evidenced by the underutilisation of potentially irrigable land (162.5 km2 in 2017 and 145.4 km2 in 2024). The study underscores the necessity for targeted policy interventions to optimise irrigation and enhance agricultural productivity and water resource management."}}

Key energy and emission sources included electricity for irrigation, fertilizers and diesel. Compared to full irrigation (FI), MDI reduced water (25%), energy (15%), and GHG emissions (18%) with minimal yield loss and improved resourceefficiencies. Higher N rates under FI and MDI increased yield and input productivity but also raised emissions; under SDI, higher N lowered water and energy productivity. BR application, especially thiourea, enhanced yields and resource use efficiencies without notably increasing emissions. The combination of MDI, with 120 kg N, and thiourea application had highest WEFG index, indicating optimal balance among productivity, efficiency, and environmental performance.

Platform-based employment models are diverse. Characteristics and operational mechanisms differ among each model. In labour-relationship-based models, also known as the 'employ-employee' model, workers have a relatively close subordinate relationship with platform companies, while civil-cooperation-based model involve collaboration between companies and workers based on equal civil subject status. Meanwhile, the quasiemployment relationship model falls between traditional labour relationships and civil relationships, with workers having a relatively weaker subordinate relationship. However, while this model provides workers with flexible employment opportunities, it also poses significant challenges in terms of rights protection, particularly regarding disputes between workers and platforms. Such disputes not only increase in number each year but also have complex causes, including outdated laws and regulations, unclear standards for determining labour relationships, ambiguous definitions of platform company responsibilities, weak awareness of worker rights, and inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms. In handling these disputes, courts, lawyers, and platform companies face challenges such as difficulty in determining legal relationships, high barriers to evidence collection, and diverse claims. These issues urgently require solutions through measures such as improving laws and regulations, strengthening platform responsibility, and enhancing workers' awareness of their rights. This article aims to comprehensively analyse the current status, characteristics, and causes of platform employment disputes under the new employment landscape, examine the operational mechanisms and legal risks of different platform employment models, and through the analysis of typical cases, summarise the courts' judicial reasoning and adjudication criteria, as well as successful dispute resolution experiences. This article seeks to provide targeted solutions and guidelines for both platform companies and workers to address these challenges."}}

Here, we incorporate wastewater signals within a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal model to estimate active mpox cases, defined as individuals who are actively shedding the virus. Our model allows for estimation of active mpox cases within community health service areas, the most precise geographical level of health administration in British Columbia, Canada over time. The inclusion of a time-varying wastewater signal improved the model fit to active cases (WAIC = 3569, Δ 51). The mean absolute error of mpox active cases was ~ 2 cases (95%CI, 1-4) per community health service area. Our study demonstrates the use of hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal models as essential tools in wastewater-based infectious diseases surveillance, emphasizing the importance of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in understanding the patterns in both wastewater signals and actively shedding mpox cases."}}

These limitations impede effective modeling of complex patterns, prompting the need for a more robust approach.Therefore, the paper proposes Alter, a hierarchical framework to overcome these limitations. The methodology first applies Concatenated Fourier Features (CFF) to transform the original sequence into a feature space that enhances pattern detectability. This is followed by the Spatial-Temporal-Random Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for extracting intrinsic characteristics and the Ridge Regressor that produces accurate forecasts.The Spatial-Temporal-Random MLP integrates three key innovations: (1) Alterable Kernel Convolution (AKConv) is improved to Spatial AKConv, strengthening feature correlations across spatial dimensions. (2) A lightweight Efficient Gated Unit is designed to effectively capture both long-term and short-term dependencies, addressing the temporal modeling gap. (3) Random Implicit Neural Representation (INR) is proposed to extract randomness, a critical component often overlooked in traditional models.Experiments show Alter performs better than state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, with average improvements of 5.07%, 3.66%, and 3.99% in multivariate, univariate, and few-shot tasks, respectively.The code is available in https://github.com/weirdoZHANG/Alter."}}

Next, we design a modality-specific enhancement module that refines the quality of each modality’s features prior to fusion. Lastly, we introduce a gated fusion network that adaptively balances the contributions of each modality to achieve robust multimodal fusion. We validate GFN-MSE on three standard datasets–CMU MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS–and the results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across all evaluation metrics."}}

It includes essential features not found in standard models: household heterogeneity with distinct asset holdings, wealth in utility, endogenous growth through education, working capital needs, borrowing limits, and endogenous risk premia reflecting financial frictions and weak rule of law. Estimated for Türkiye, OMEGA assesses monetary, fiscal, structural, and climate policies, replicating standard responses to shocks. Simulations of a broad variety of climate policy interventions reveal significant interaction effects, and results show weak policy credibility increases transition costs by delaying investment. OMEGA offers a robust framework for evaluating development policies in emerging markets."}}

Algal flora, for the first time sampled from two post-mining ditches in the area of Upper Silesia (Southern Poland), is characterized by low biodiversity. In this study, we examined the possibility of using mainly autochthonous (indigenous) diatoms and green algal strains from these two ditches, but also some allochthonous green and xanthophyte algal strains from a sewage treatment plant, as so-called biological starters. The use of biological starters, i.e. algal mats growing on solid substrate, prepared in laboratory conditions for placement in post-mining waters, is a new method developed to increase their biodiversity and accelerate purification processes. The rate of biological mass increase for individual algal strains, both one-celled and filamentous, growing together on solid substrate as examined in the water collected from the two ditches under experimental laboratory conditions. Several autochtonous one-celled diatoms, especially Pinnularia appendiculata, and filamentous green algae, Klebsormidium sp. and Mougeotia sp., as well as one allochtonous one-celled green alga, Tetradesmus lagerheimii, turned out to be the most resistant to the conditions prevailing in both ditches, and at the same time the most suitable for inhabiting this type of habitats. These algal taxa were the most important element in the structure of biological starters on solid substrates. Next, the potential of the biological starters to bioaccumulate chemical compounds occurring in elevated concentrations in degraded mine watercourses should be investigated."}}
