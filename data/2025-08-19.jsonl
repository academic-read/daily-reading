The primary objective is to enhance the timely and accurate identification of malicious activities by leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of deep neural networks. A hybrid research methodology was adopted, combining real-world industrial control system (ICS) datasets with simulated attack scenarios to evaluate model performance. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Autoencoders, were implemented and compared based on detection accuracy, false positive rate, and computational efficiency. The findings reveal that Autoencoder-based models exhibited superior performance in detecting subtle anomalies with minimal false positives, while RNNs demonstrated robustness in capturing temporal dependencies within network traffic.

The analysis traces the evolution from foundational Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to modern architectures like Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), highlighting the central role of a modular design in enabling fine-grained control over the image synthesis process. The report systematically analyzes how architectural and functional modularity, exemplified by frameworks like ControlNet and compositional operators, provides a foundation for decomposing the generative process. A crucial component of this decomposition is the enhanced interpretability, and this work examines how techniques such as latent space exploration, attention-based probing, and component attribution reveal the semantic underpinnings of model behavior. Finally, the report demonstrates the practical utility of this modular approach in high-impact downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, domain adaptation, and high-fidelity image-to-image translation. This analysis argues that modularity and interpretability are not merely technical improvements but are essential prerequisites for advancing the field of generative AI responsibly and efficiently."}}

Crucially, the one-tomany framework allows identification of cross-complementarity terms between workers in both non-wage amenities and productivity, in addition to the standard sorting between workers and firms. This makes it possible to identify how worker segregation impacts wage gaps, along with worker and firm sorting. The paper applies the framework to the Portuguese labor market, and shows that the compression of the wage structure along the education dimension is not only driven by an education expansion, but also by a reduction in complementarities in productivity between educated workers."}}

This study examines how persuasive elements in such videos, perceived usefulness, curiosity, and envy, affect consumer attitudes and visit intentions, using an extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework. An online survey of 311 Gen Z and Millennial consumers, who are active social media users, was conducted. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings reveal that perceived usefulness, curiosity, and envy significantly influence attitudes, which in turn positively predict visit intentions. Subjective norms also positively affect both attitudes and visit intentions, whereas perceived behavioral control does not significantly influence visit intentions. These results highlight the cognitive and emotional mechanisms driving offline retail visitation following online exposure to short-form video content. The study contributes to retail and consumer services literature by extending TPB with contemporary digital marketing variables and by demonstrating the persuasive power of social media videos in the retail context. Practical recommendations are offered for destination retailers to design video content that enhances perceived usefulness, evokes benign envy, sparks curiosity, and leverages social validation to increase foot traffic."}}

Global economic interaction has existed in various forms since the earliest days of organized society. Since the Industrial Revolution, this integration has accelerated, becoming largely irreversible. This is driven by the fundamental truth that business and profit motivations often transcend national borders, cultural differences, and political boundaries. Whenever mutual advantage is perceived, cross-border business relationships are rapidly established. The rapid pace of internationalization has intensified global competition, prompting companies to adopt more effective and realistic management strategies. In this context, strategic management has gained prominence as a discipline distinct from traditional operational management. Unlike techniques that solely aim to improve efficiency, strategic management involves comprehensive planning and alignment with a company’s external environment.

The P&amp;R was drowning in debt, much already in default. Equipment was being seized in foreclosures. System infrastructure was incomplete. The P&amp;R teetered on the brink of bankruptcy.

It desperately needed rolling stock to commence operations and generate a bit of revenue, assuage creditors, and induce lenders to continue to fund. The machine shop of The Proprietors of Locks and Canals on Merrimack River had almost no work in 1841 and 1842. Patrick Tracy Jackson, the L&amp;C treasurer, was considering selling the shop or converting it to a twist mill.

As a condition to award of the building contracts, Chauncy sought a loan from L&amp;C. L&amp;C eschewed debt and lending; it sought equity in the P&amp;R as an entrée to the railroad and anthracite coal industries. After long negotiations, L&amp;C agreed to build the rolling stock for the P&amp;R. Jackson devised a unique financing structure, including unique collateral security and remedies elements, that became core elements of what later emerged as the dominant U.S. equipment finance structure. But with the gain came great pain. The two-year transaction took eight years, with constant machinations and maneuvering, including surreptitious stock purchases and sales to diminish the influence of the Bank of the United States, the first audit of managerial custodianship in U.S. history, relocation of a country seat, a preferred stock gambit, and the delicate and dangerous dance of debt in default. This paper is taken from the introduction to the book Michael J.T. McMillen, Patrick Tracy Jackson: Philadelphia &amp; Reading, published in 2025.</span></p>"}}

This analysis examines how the convergence of the 21st Century Cures Act implementation and the European Health Data Space Regulation creates an unprecedented opportunity to transition from institutioncontrolled health records to patient-owned health profiles. Through analysis of current regulatory gaps, documented care coordination failures costing $30+ billion annually, and emerging patient demand for data control, we demonstrate that patient-owned health records represent both economic necessity and policy inevitability. PHeaMeR provides the first comprehensive policy framework for this transition, establishing principles for patient data sovereignty, cross-border portability, and AI-enhanced personalization. This framework addresses fundamental inefficiencies in current healthcare data architecture while building upon existing regulatory foundations rather than requiring radical policy departures."}}

The appeal will require consideration of how to determine when a trade mark has acquired a reputation and when the use of a similar mark, but in a different commercial field, will cause confusion. The second issue relates to a separate cancellation ground that applies where the use of the registered mark has come to cause confusion post-registration, and will require the High Court to clarify the nature of the use that needs to be considered. The third issue goes to the interpretation of a provision that gives the court discretion not to order the cancellation of a registration, even if one of the aforementioned grounds of cancellation has been made out. We explore each of these issues, highlighting the main areas of uncertainty on which it would be useful to receive guidance from the High Court. We pay particular attention to the third issue, arguing that the provision in question should be interpreted so that it does not in fact give a court any discretion to refuse cancellation where the application for cancellation is based on the first cancellation ground at issue in this case."}}

This study investigates the application of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques for real-time cyber threat detection in critical infrastructure environments, such as energy grids, transportation networks, and water supply systems. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning models in accurately identifying malicious activities while maintaining low false positive rates and ensuring timely response. To achieve this, the research employs a hybrid methodology combining realtime data collection from simulated industrial control systems (ICS) and public intrusion detection datasets. Feature engineering techniques are applied to capture temporal and behavioral patterns of network traffic. Multiple ML models-including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Autoencoders, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks-are trained and tested on these datasets. Their performance is assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, detection latency, and scalability metrics. Key findings reveal that deep learning models, particularly LSTM-based architectures, outperform traditional ML algorithms in detecting complex and evolving attack patterns with higher accuracy and faster detection times. However, they require more computational resources and careful tuning to minimize false alarms. The study concludes that integrating ML-driven detection mechanisms with existing security infrastructure can significantly enhance the resilience of critical systems against sophisticated cyber threats, provided that considerations for model interpretability and deployment constraints are addressed."}}

Grounded in fieldwork from Fujian Province and guided by national policy frameworks, the research develops a multidimensional conceptual framework encompassing functional transformation, spatial integration, carbon mitigation, and institutional innovation, offering empirical insights into the scalability and replicability of rural adaptive reuse models. Scenario-based analysis further quantifies the projected impact of such transformations on carbon peak timing and decarbonization pathways. An integrated model combining scenario-based carbon modelling, case study comparison, spatial analysis, and policy evaluation. Results show that the adaptive reuse of just 30% of China's ~68,000 idle rural schools could yield over 400,000 metric tons of CO₂ reduction by 2060, with average annual savings of 1.2 tons per building an 80% improvement in energy performance compared to conventional rural buildings. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses further reveal that modest gains in retrofit quality or uptake rates could quadruple total emissions reductions. Beyond carbon benefits, GRCs offer co-benefits in rural education, community cohesion, ecosystem services, and decentralised infrastructure. The study introduces a five-phase strategic framework for scaling rural retrofits and provides policy recommendations for embedding reuse within broader rural regeneration agendas and mainstream adaptive reuse into national rural regeneration and climate action agendas. These findings contribute to reframing rural idle buildings not as symbols of decline, but as critical assets in the transition toward low-carbon, resilient, and inclusive development while also supporting urban-rural co-dependence through decentralised service provision and spatial equity."}}

We review existing literature, analyze policy recommendations, and highlight initiatives aimed at leveraging AI for workforce training and veteran job placement. The paper synthesizes findings from government reports, academic studies, and industry insights to provide a comprehensive overview of current trends and future directions. This paper further examines the evolving landscape of work, the role of upskilling and reskilling in addressing the skills gap, and the unique position of veterans as a strategic workforce asset. It explores how AI is not only redefining job tasks but also serving as a tool to aid veterans in their transition from military to civilian life. Furthermore, the paper highlights key governmental and private-sector initiatives, including policies from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and public-private partnerships, designed to leverage AI for workforce development and veteran empowerment. This paper surveys current literature, policy developments, training programs, public-private partnerships, and technology trajectories to illuminate the rapidly evolving workforce ecosystem. Special attention is given to veterans' transition from military to civilian jobs, with AI both as a skills multiplier and a disruptor. This is a review paper and all findings are from cited literature."}}

The country is experiencing rapid warming and demographic aging, records approximately 1,000 heatstroke deaths annually, over 80% of which involve elderly people. With a large elderly population, targeted interventions that account for climate and demographic changes are essential. This study estimated, at a 1 km resolution, the distribution and total of the at-risk elderly population (AREP), defined as the elderly population residing in grid cells where wet-bulb globe temperatures reach heatstroke risk thresholds, and potential cumulative exposure (PCE, person-hours), the product of AREP and exposure duration, under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1–1.9, SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP5–8.5). We also projected intervention costs for air-conditioner installation and electricity subsidies. For the 2060s to the 2080s, using alternative heatstroke alert criteria (AHAC) thresholds that reflect the regional vulnerability of the elderly, AREP was widely distributed across the mainland and southern areas, totaling 30–32 million. In most municipalities, AREP exceeded 40% of the local population. PCE varied markedly by scenarios, reaching 10.0 billion person-hours under SSP5–8.5, more than double the 4.8 billion under SSP1–1.9. Annual intervention costs were estimated at 164 to 177 million USD using 4% discount rate. These costs were offset only when a low discount rate (0.1%) was applied to future health impacts, underscoring the ethical implications of discounting in intergenerational health risk assessments. Our findings provide spatially detailed insights to support the design of effective, targeted interventions for managing future heat-health risks."}}

A calibrated quantitative model incorporating both channels shows that electrification accounts for 3.1% of the fertility decline in 1900–1940. This modest effect reflects the offsetting nature of the two channels and prevailing labor norms that limited female labor force attachment."}}

The monolithic focus on publishing in the top-five journals, which prioritizes methodological rigor over problem-driven research, is often a threat to social relevance and policy applicability.

We propose a two-track model for PhD training and academic evaluation, emphasizing both traditional research and applied economic policy, tailored to the diverse needs of academia, public administration and business sectors. We also argue for broader evaluation criteria, enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration, and institutional reforms, including trial lectures and specialized research institutes. By diversifying incentives, we recommend a shift towards socially relevant and more inclusive education and practice in the discipline of economics."}}

Most strikingly, geopolitical risk shocks consistently increase the volatility of global inflation. These findings underscore the dual challenge geopolitical risk poses for monetary policy: managing both inflation and its instability in an increasingly uncertain world, where such shocks act less as independent drivers than as amplifiers of prevailing macroeconomic conditions."}}

Moreover, these declines are substantially larger in the parts of England most impacted by the Revolution. We also explore the extent to which different characteristics predict being rich. We then study a key facet of this increased social mobility-geographical and occupational mobility. We show that people with surnames that were more mobile tended to be in the north and working in manufacturing. Moreover, areas that experienced greater outward mobility were more urbanized; less agrarian; had institutionalized markets; more gentry; were poorer (as proxied by tax revenues); and were more likely to be the residence of a member of parliament."}}

Drawing on data from the United Nations Population Division, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), and the World Bank, the study analyzes key indicators such as fertility, mortality, life expectancy, and their regional variations. Results indicate that while declining mortality, especially among children and mothers, has contributed to population growth, persistently high fertility rates in many sub-Saharan countries sustain rapid natural increase. Comparative analysis reveals significant differences between nations in advanced demographic transition, such as Egypt and South Africa, and those in earlier stages, such as Niger and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Socioeconomic factors-including female education, access to healthcare, and urbanization-are found to strongly correlate with fertility decline. The paper concludes that managing Africa's population growth requires targeted, context-specific policies focused on women's empowerment, reproductive health, and strategic investment in human capital to harness the potential demographic dividend."}}

This study examines whether Mulvaney's sophisticated transformation from critic to enabler represents an individual anomaly or exposes systematic vulnerabilities in democratic systems. Using systematic timeline analysis with structural break detection, we document the transformation patterns of ten prominent Republicans who initially opposed Trump. We find a four-phase progression (Initial Resistance → Gradual Accommodation → Sophisticated Defense → Institutional Enabling) replicated across 90% of cases, with clear temporal break points averaging 18 months. The study identifies six distinct rationalization mechanisms - intellectual, institutional, career, foreign policy, oscillatory, and identity-based - that share common \"enabler psychology\" functions: epistemic conditional compliance (truth becomes negotiable), constitutional conditional compliance (democratic principles become contingent), and critical loyalism (acknowledging flaws while providing systematic cover). The January 6, 2021 insurrection created temporary resistance in 70% of cases, yet all but one resumed enablement within six months. Strong correlation (r=0.78, p&lt;0.01) exists between transformation speed and career advancement opportunities. These findings reveal that democratic erosion in advanced democracies operates through predictable elite psychological patterns that convert democratic guardians into sophisticated enablers of anti-democratic behavior. The intellectual frameworks developed by educated elites to rationalize their transformations - from \"binary choice\" arguments to \"elite failure\" narratives - provide crucial legitimacy for democratic backsliding.

The wireless body sensors can then be configured to convey the patient's status directly to the assigned doctor/nurse through the personal smart phone, Using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in healthcare system has yielded a tremendous effort in recent years. However, in most of these researches, tasks like sensor data processing, health state decisions making and emergency messages sending are completed by a remote server. This paper presents an innovative Wireless Personal Area Network architecture that takes advantage of some of the features provided by Intelligent Environments-large number of devices, heterogeneous networks and mobility enhancement in order to adapt and personalize ambient conditions to the user profile."}}

In Sub-Saharan Africa, however, literacy acquisition remains a critical and persistent challenge despite decades of educational expansion and substantial international investment. While primary school enrollment rates have markedly increased, literacy proficiency-particularly functional reading and writing skills-lags behind, with the region recording some of the lowest adult and youth literacy rates globally. This study investigates the state of literacy development in Sub-Saharan Africa through a mixed-methods design, integrating quantitative analysis of longitudinal data from UNESCO, the World Bank, and national demographic surveys with qualitative synthesis of policy documents, academic literature, and program evaluations. Findings reveal a pronounced disconnect between educational access and learning outcomes, with over 80% of Grade 2 learners in several countries unable to read a simple sentence in any language. Key structural impediments include inadequate teacher training in early-grade reading pedagogy, insufficient instructional resources, overcrowded classrooms, and the persistent mismatch between home languages and the colonial or official languages used in formal education. Linguistic diversity-while culturally enriching-compounds instructional challenges when education systems fail to incorporate mother-tongue-based multilingual education in early years. Gender disparities remain acute, with female literacy rates trailing male counterparts by up to 30 percentage points in some regions, driven by socio-cultural norms, early marriage, and household labor expectations. Policy analysis underscores that interventions such as mother-tongue instruction, community-based reading initiatives, conditional cash transfers, and school feeding programs can yield measurable literacy gains when embedded within coherent, well-resourced national strategies. However, many promising initiatives remain pilot-scale, donor-dependent, and poorly integrated into systemic educational frameworks, limiting sustainability and scalability. The study argues that addressing literacy deficits in Sub-Saharan Africa demands an integrated policy approach that aligns curriculum design, teacher professional development, language policy, and community engagement. It advocates for early-grade instruction in local languages, gender-responsive educational strategies, strengthened teacher preparation, and robust monitoring systems to ensure accountability. Ultimately, improving literacy in the region is not solely an educational objective but a developmental imperative with far-reaching implications for public health, democratic participation, and economic 2 resilience. The research calls for sustained political commitment, cross-sectoral collaboration, and evidence-driven policy design to transform literacy from a persistent deficit into a catalyst for equitable and sustainable development."}}

Following a change-on-change regression design and addressing endogeneity via social-trust-based instruments, we find that greater adoption of cashless payments significantly accelerates real GDP growth. Disaggregated analysis reveals that the effect is concentrated in the secondary and tertiary sectors and is primarily driven by card-based transactions, with note-based payments contributing mainly to the primary sector. Decomposition by transaction metrics shows that both higher transaction frequency and larger average transaction values—especially for card payments—drive the growth effect. The impact is substantially stronger in provinces with lower financial development and in the post-COVID-19 period, consistent with theories of financial inclusion and the role of contactless payments in sustaining activity during public health crises. Mechanism tests indicate that the expansion of cashless payments is associated with reduced income inequality, which in turn supports more inclusive growth. Further analysis shows positive spillovers to fiscal revenues, enterprise creation, and fixed asset investment. Overall, our findings highlight cashless payment infrastructure as a catalyst for broad-based economic development in digitally transitioning economies."}}

I extend the production network framework of Acemoglu et al.

Estimated GDP elasticities with respect to energy import prices range from –0.037 to –0.006 across countries, with differences in network centrality accounting for most of the cross-country variation."}}

While College Savings Accounts (CSAs), or 529 plans, offer tax-advantaged vehicles for college savings, their adoption patterns and educational impacts remain poorly understood. Using comprehensive administrative data from over 900,000 Illinois 529 accounts (2000-2023) linked to educational outcomes, plus complementary surveys of account owners and parents, we provide the first large-scale analysis of CSA participation and effectiveness. We find that while CSA adoption has expanded to every ZIP code in Illinois, participation remains concentrated among higherincome, more educated families. Financial literacy emerges as a key barrier: 61% of parents who could save enough to cover half of future college costs still perceive their potential savings as meaningless. Among participants, higher savings are strongly correlated with better educational outcomes, including four-year college enrollment, attendance at selective institutions, and the pursuit of postgraduate degrees. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing financial literacy gaps and misperceptions about modest savings could significantly expand CSA effectiveness as a tool for educational equity. Beyond state-level 529 program optimization, our findings suggest several promising avenues for federal policy coordination and institutional innovation."}}

These findings underscore the PBoC's adaptability and responsiveness to economic fluctuations and its preference for risk management."}}

Many older individuals reduce their working hours, and in occupations with high part-time penalties, they tend to retire earlier, as observed in data from Japan and the United States. This study develops a general equilibrium model that incorporates occupational choices, endogenous labor supply, highlighting that the impact on the retirement decision is amplified by the presence of assets and pensions. Using the Japanese Panel Study of Employment Dynamics, I find that cutting employees’ pension benefits reduce aggregate labor supply in occupations with high part-time penalties, reducing overall welfare across the economy. Furthermore, a commonly used policy measure—extending the pension eligibility age—is also found to decrease both output and welfare. In contrast, this paper suggests that increasing income tax credits and exempting pension benefits from income taxation can boost labor supply across all occupations. These policies enhance welfare by raising disposable income relative to the reservation wage."}}

While several economists have studied the potential costs associated with tax complexity, few have explored if complexity can also have beneficial effects. In a novel model where taxpayers can acquire costly knowledge to reduce their tax burden, we show that when elasticities of taxable income are heterogeneous, a complex tax system can act as a sorting device similar to second-degree price discrimination, where more elastic taxpayers will invest in more tax knowledge. We prove that if elasticities are increasing with income, introducing tax complexity can allow the government to raise higher tax revenues at no efficiency cost. However, we show that complexity primarily benefits the highest earners and thus exacerbates inequality. In the empirical section of our work, we study a complex tax system in Norway. Using rich register data on business owners, we demonstrate that many taxpayers make accounting decisions that cause them to pay higher taxes than would have been possible, and we quantify the exact size of this tax overpayment at the individual level. We show that overpayment tends to be larger for women, the less wealthy, and immigrants. We validate our model predictions by showing that failure to optimize is associated with a lower estimated tax elasticity."}}

Using a dynamic model that integrates demographic projections into the intertemporal government budget constraint, we show that ageing populations exert upward pressure on debt-to-GDP ratios by dampening output growth, weakening primary fiscal balances, and causing a negative differential between the rate of output growth and the average cost of financing the debt. While Germany and the Netherlands benefit from relatively favorable demographic fundamentals and disciplined fiscal policy, countries like Italy, Spain, France, and the US face increasing debt sustainability risks. Counterfactual simulations highlight that sustained migration inflows can significantly mitigate these risks by improving the age structure of the population, raising growth, and lowering fiscal deficits. These findings underscore the importance of demographic-aware fiscal frameworks and the role of migration policy as a tool for macroeconomic stabilization."}}

As of today, the role of the state in providing favorable conditions for the promotion of high-tech products in foreign markets is growing significantly. At the same time, the role of the state is not so much in direct assistance to business entities (which is quite difficult given the financial situation of the state during the war), but in the use of other effective tools and institutions designed to stimulate production and export of high-tech products. At present, the Export Credit Agency of Ukraine is considered to be such an effective institution. In connection with the above, in order to learn from the positive experience, the article analyzes the formation of this institution in other countries and its positive impact on foreign trade of such states. According to the results of the analysis, the advantages of creating and properly organizing the activities of these Export Credit Agencies for the economy of a particular country as a whole and for individual businesses. Some aspects of modern legal regulation of the Export Credit Agency in Ukraine have been studied. In addition, the changes to the current legislation in the legal regulation of ESA activities, which were adopted during the martial law in Ukraine, are highlighted and analyzed, their impact on the real stimulation of exports of Ukrainian products is predicted. Given the special importance of Ukrainian exports during the war, as well as the need to increase the supply of high value-added products, proposals were made to improve the activities of the Export Credit Agency of Ukraine in terms of ensuring and stimulating exports of high-tech products."}}

The court stated that the “settlement agreement leaves unresolved the question that motivated this multidistrict litigation: whether the collection of publicly available biometric information for use by private or government entities . . . is reconcilable with constitutional privacy rights.” This Article helps answer that unresolved question. But privacy is too narrow a framework. Constitutional rights of free speech, association and assembly are also affected.<br><br> This Article makes two claims, one descriptive and one normative. The descriptive claim is two-fold: (1) existing First Amendment law does not resolve the novel question of whether laws that limit how private actors use publicly available images violate their First Amendment rights, and (2) free speech advocates are divided on the proper response. The normative claim answers the unresolved question by concluding that some regulation of private actor use of publicly available images to create faceprints and FRT databases should be found constitutionally permissible.<br><br>Not only does this Article analyze the First Amendment arguments of FRT companies like Clearview AI, but it also introduces the other half of the story: the First Amendment interests of the faceprinted. After identifying problematic uses of FRT and showing the inadequacy of existing law, this Article makes the normative argument by engaging with three methods of constitutional interpretation, identifying First Amendment values that support regulating the use of FRT, and drawing lessons from Fourth Amendment doctrine and theory."}}

Shocks to peer funds-identified solely through shared investor attention-predict subsequent returns and flows of focal funds, above and beyond the effects of overlapping stock holdings, style similarity, and textual similarity in fund prospectuses. Consistent with limited investor attention, these spillover effects are sluggish and amplified for connections that investors tend to overlook. Fund managers actively respond to negative spillovers by rebalancing portfolios away from attention-linked peers. In contrast, idiosyncratic peer shocks-such as key manager departures-generate positive inflows to attention-linked funds.

In our static model, the sign of the fertility effect depends solely on the intra-household wage gap: when fathers earn more than mothers, stricter leave reduces fertility by diverting high-wage labor from the market; when mothers earn more, the reverse holds. When paternal and maternal wages are equal, the model predicts a neutrality: reallocating childcare between parents leaves total household labor income unchanged, so paternity leave alters only the intrahousehold division of time and not the opportunity cost of children. This implies that eliminating the gender wage gap would remove any direct fertility impact of paternity leave-meaning that such policies are more effective when a wage gap exists. A two-period extension shows that insufficient subsidies amplify the negative effect in high-paternal-wage households, while the dynamic model reveals that stricter leave can delay births by lowering the marginal utility of current childbearing in anticipation of future time constraints. Comparative statics from the static, two-period, and dynamic models further reveal a fiscal trade-off: when paternity-leave mandates reduce fertility in high-paternal-wage households, larger subsidies are required to maintain a given fertility target, but childcare subsidies and flexible work can soften this trade-off. An extended static model incorporating childcare subsidies and flexible work arrangements demonstrates that combining paternity leave with both instruments mitigates negative effects in high-paternal-wage households and supports stable fertility while advancing equity objectives. In economies with persistent wage gaps, such a policy portfolio is particularly effective; under full wage equality, paternity leave is demographically neutral unless paired with flexible work, in which case it can increase fertility even without a wage gap."}}

The model, identified as GVAR-IIS, uses a global vector autoregressive methodology that deals with the curse of dimensionality augmented with Impulse-Indicator Saturation dummies to account for structural breaks. The model is tested in empirical research focusing on the Brazilian labour market. In the empirical analysis, the GVAR-IIS model is compared against several other forecasting models such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), as well as the classical GVAR. Forecasts are compared using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics, and a Model Confidence Set (MCS) is computed. The study finds that the GVAR-IIS model is present on the final MCS, and that the IIS procedure can capture the shocks. In conclusion, the study suggests that the GVAR-IIS methodology can provide parsimonious forecasting models taking into account the dynamics of the region's employment and deal, not only with the curse of dimensionality in a manageable form but also deals with structural breaks."}}

We further decompose overall mobility into structural and exchange components. We find that China exhibits more overall educational mobility than Russia mostly due to greater structural mobility, while Russia exhibits greater steady state educational mobility. In contrast, both the overall and steady state occupational mobility is similar in China and Russia. Comparing these results to the US, we find that steady state mobility in education is substantially higher in the US and Russia compared to China, but occupational steady state mobility is comparable in all three countries."}}

However, this was not possible for India, a large emerging economy with a significant population undergoing demographic transition, due to a paucity of data. We use the new dataset Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)-Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) and use a panel to create Labour Flow Charts and Transition Matrices for India from January 2019 to December 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these were created for India. We then use that to look at the impact of Covid-19 on the Indian labour market. We not only look at transitions between employment, unemployment and out of labour force, but also across types of employment-full-time and part-time. The rich data also allows us to consider heterogeneity in the labour market and look at the differential impact of the pandemic across different education groups and gender. From the labour flow charts and transition probabilities, we find that while all groups have been impacted, the magnitude of the impact is different across groups. The recovery is also uneven, and the extent depends on education levels. Further, we do an event study analysis to examine the likelihood of getting a full-time job across different educational and gender groups. Men, on average, enjoy a higher likelihood of getting a full-time job than women. The likelihood coefficients also go up with increasing educational qualifications. Looking at skill heterogeneity, while the likelihood of getting a full-time job either goes down for most groups during the pandemic or the change is minuscule, strikingly it goes up for those with no education, for both men and women. The likelihood coefficients remain elevated for men even after the restrictions are removed, and that for women reverts to the level seen before the pandemic. Finally, this paper provides a way to continuously monitor the dynamics of the labour market as data is released in the regular intervals in the future, which would be of great value for researchers and policymakers alike."}}

Three UAV models-Iris, Typhoon H480 and Octocopter-were evaluated across a range of payloads (0.1-5 kg), cruise speeds (2-16 m/s) and environmental factors, including wind, temperature and humidity. Results revealed consistent U-shaped energy-speed curves, with optimal cruise speeds ranging from 8 to 10 m/s, depending on the payload and platform.

This paper examines how banks adjust their loan pricing when firms have a higher share of passive index fund investors as shareholders. Using syndicated loan data, we find that loan spreads increase with passive ownership, and provide evidence consistent with higher loan spreads reflecting increased risk due to reduced shareholder oversight. Supporting this interpretation, we find stronger effects among well-governed and informationally opaque firms, where shareholder oversight is more impactful. However, the increase in loan spreads is not fully accounted for by changes in traditional measures of firm risk. Suggestive evidence points towards banks increasing their monitoring intensity in response to changes in shareholder composition, which is costly and reflected in loan spreads."}}

In contrast, demand shocks, which signal economic expansion, prompt firms to reduce YCC by extending credit terms to support growth and strengthen customer relationships. Using a large panel of U.S. public firms from 1987 to 2023, we find these effects are economically significant and more pronounced among financially constrained firms, those operating in low transparency and highly competitive environments, as well as firms with direct oil exposure. Our findings reveal a novel operational channel through which macroeconomic disturbances shape corporate behavior, offering new insights into how firms tactically manage liquidity and financial flexibility in response to external shocks."}}

While a significant body of research explores the structural determinants of environmental behavior, the psychological mechanisms, particularly those linked to social identity, remain less understood. This research addresses this gap by examining whether activating a poverty identity influences how individuals attribute environmental responsibility. We conducted lab-in-Field experiments in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, with 138 participants randomly assigned to either a poverty identity priming condition or a neutral control group. Following the priming task, we measured environmental moral disengagement using a newly developed scale. Our exploratory factor analysis identified two primary dimensions of disengagement: (1) externalizing blame (\"Not my fault\") and (2) anthropocentric prioritization (\"Human First (only)\"). The results show that priming poverty identity had a large and statistically significant positive effect on the \"Not my fault\" dimension (β = 3.747, p &lt; 0.01), indicating that participants were more likely to attribute responsibility for environmental problems to external actors like governments and wealthy nations. This effect was particularly pronounced among younger participants. Conversely, the treatment had a small, negative, and marginally significant effect on the \"Human First (only)\" dimension (β =-0.256, p &lt; 0.1). These findings suggest that activating a poverty identity can causally increase specific forms of environmental moral disengagement, highlighting an important psychological barrier that may prevent pro-environmental action in disadvantaged populations. The study underscores the need for environmental campaigns and policies to consider the influence of identity-related cognitive frames."}}

The study uses special statistical methods like fixed effects and random effects models, along with checks to make sure the results are reliable. One important part of the study is the Global Financial Stress Index (GFSI), which is made by looking at several stress markers like how much countries owe, how unstable markets are, and how much it costs to get money. The GFSI helps show how financial stress spreads around the world. The study expects to find that good economic growth, keeping inflation under control, and careful money policies help banks stay strong. But having too much debt, sudden changes in policies, and high global stress levels can make banks less stable. This research connects how individual banks perform with the bigger picture of financial stability and global conditions. It offers real data and useful ideas for people who make financial rules and decisions. The results aim to help those in charge of banks and financial policies understand what keeps or harms financial stability, especially in countries that are more at risk in the global financial system."}}

A descriptive survey research design was employed, and data were collected through a structured questionnaire. The study population consisted of 6,557 teachers across 302 public senior secondary schools in the state. A sample of 700 respondents comprising 60 principals and 640 teachers was selected using simple and stratified random sampling techniques. The reliability of the instrument was established using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC), while face and content validity were confirmed by experts in Educational Management and Educational Technology. Data were analyzed using mean and standard deviation. Findings revealed that while some ICT tools were available in the schools, their integration into classroom teaching was generally low, with over 80 percent of the mean usage scores falling below the criterion mean of 2.5 on a 5-point scale. Although teachers demonstrated moderate to high ICT proficiency, they lacked the institutional support, regular training opportunities, and enabling infrastructure necessary for consistent application in pedagogical practice. Key challenges identified included erratic power supply, poor internet connectivity, limited availability of ICT tools, and the absence of technical support personnel. Based on these findings, the study recommended that the government intensify the implementation of the National ICT-in-Education Policy by equipping schools with adequate infrastructure, ensuring ongoing teacher professional development, and providing dedicated technical support systems. These measures are essential for fostering sustainable and effective technology integration in public senior secondary schools across Rivers State."}}

To explain these patterns, we develop a simple model of rulemaking in which output gaps arise from four sources: selection (women are assigned lower-quality projects), cost (differences in the cost of exerting effort), incentive (differences in the return to effort), and evaluation (differential treatment by agency leadership). Reduced-form estimates, aided by a machine-learning C-BERT model, reveal that women are assigned to lower-quality projects and face harsher evaluations, but receive stronger incentives tied to project completion. Structural estimates confirm that disadvantages in selection, cost, and evaluation each contribute meaningfully to the observed gender gap, partially offset by females receiving stronger incentives. Our findings shed light on how female representation shapes regulatory performance and contribute to the broader debate over whether diversity enhances or hinders the effectiveness of public institutions.</p>"}}

This review examines the potential for an \"add-to-cart\" model that could transform biologics development from custom, institution-specific processes to standardized, accessible approaches, which is analogous to e-commerce. The add-to-cart model was proposed as a paradigm that enables researchers to specify therapeutic requirements through standardized interfaces and access pre-optimized biological candidates from integrated databases or platforms. This model could potentially improve utility, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, speed, exploration capabilities, and applicability compared to traditional methods. This paper reports areas and inefficiencies in the current development landscapes that could be addressed, while historical precedents from plasmid registries, semiconductor manufacturing, software development, and automotive industries illustrate transformation patterns that could inform this add-to-cart future of biologics development. Key enablers include large-scale biological databases, AI-powered design engines, automated synthesis platforms, standardized interfaces, and appropriate regulatory frameworks. Implementation could fundamentally alter biologics development from bench to bedside, democratizing therapeutic innovation while maintaining scientific rigor. The convergence of computational capabilities, biological databases, and infrastructure development creates conditions for the emergence of the model. Collectively, systematic approaches to biologics development may represent an inevitable evolution toward an add-to-cart approach, providing more efficient and accessible therapeutic innovation."}}

It fundamentally transformed the postwar trading system, which had been primarily focused on goods, by creating the World Trade Organization (WTO) and introducing binding rules for services and intellectual property.1 This paper analyzes the genesis and structure of two of the Round's most significant outcomes: the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). It argues that these agreements signified a paradigm shift, moving global trade governance from a narrow focus on tariffs and border measures to a broader regulatory framework that addresses the \"behind-the-border\" policies central to the modern knowledge-and service-based economy. The paper examines the core principles, structure, and strategic implications of TRIPS and GATS, highlighting the political and economic forces that shaped them and their enduring impact on international trade, development, and national sovereignty."}}

This paper analyzes the findings of a comprehensive primary survey that we conducted for this study and examines the impact of alternative incentive policies on consumer preferences for electric vehicles, and evaluates the effects of substituting these incentives for direct purchase subsidies. Our findings suggest that policymakers should prioritize incorporating recurring value-added benefits in addition to direct subsidies. Such incentives would help reduce longterm operational costs and offer a sustainable transition to low-carbon mobility."}}

These bonds were designed with very specific cashflows for the respective goals. They combined accumulation, decumulation, inflation and compounding in a single instrument to overcome the typical financial literacy challenges/behavioral biases faced by average investors globally. These bonds, purchased voluntarily, on a simple two-question app, have been successful and are being considered by other countries in the developed and developing world as they address key social challenges. The only two questions to be answered are: (a) start date of targeted cashflows (e.g., one's retirement date or when a child would enter college); and (b) target real amount desired (e.g., R$ 5,000 per month) from such investments, with the idea being that ALL investors, of all levels of financial literacy and income levels can answer such questions. These instruments were issued with various start dates of payments to cater to different age cohorts to target their respective goal-cash flow needs.\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n <p><span>Brazil’s Tesouro Nacional (NT) has kept very detailed records of the age of investors in the respective instruments and distributional data (along with gender, region of purchase etc.). One of the intriguing elements from an analysis of the data is that there is a mismatch between what specific instrument the app on NT’s website would recommend to investors based on their target retirement date or child’s date of college entrance (call it “guided choice” or “nudge”), and the actual age/date distribution of investors based on data over the last 1.5-2 years. The unanswered research questions we are pursuing is whether the app is not entirely effective in educating/guiding/nudging investors, or whether investors are displaying rational behavior, exhibiting some form of behavioral bias, or are purely speculating (given that these are very long-duration bonds and hence offer oversized returns if say the investor goes long duration of 50 years and interest rates drop 1% in a short span of time), or some combination of the above. There are six puzzles that we examine within this data set, including why young people are buying bonds targeted to older investors? why older investors appear to be more risk averse and select bonds that are the guided choice? why we get unusual distributions by age in the education bond etc.? We examine the data for all start dates of each of Renda+ (8 instruments with start dates of 2030, 2035….2065) and Educa+ (17 instruments with start dates of 2025, 2026,….2041), and try to discern if the portfolio choices reflect “rational”, “behavioral” or “speculative” decisions.<i></i></span></p>\n</div>"}}

However, this stability has been accompanied by a significant slowdown in economic growth. Specifically, the average annual growth rate from 1974 to 2022 has dropped to approximately 1%, down from around 7% in the preceding 20 years. Existing literature suggests we would expect economic growth to accelerate, particularly in the years following Greece's integration into the European Union in 1981. It did not occur, raising the question: why not? This essay offers the explanation that political stability in Greece has resulted from a redistribution mechanism of income and wealth, which was embedded in the 1975 Constitution. This mechanism established a broad range of new 'social' rights while further constraining property rights. By addressing these social rights through the public budget and imposing ad hoc burdens on the private economy, this mechanism enhanced political stability. However, in an open market economy like Greece's, this approach has proven counterproductive, leading to stagnation of economic growth and increasing the likelihood that political stability could be disrupted. To safeguard against the risks to democracy and even national sovereignty that this outlook presents, it is crucial to eliminate the aforementioned redistribution mechanism from the constitution. An even better solution would be to adopt the new constitution recently proposed by six eminent Greeks."}}

Originating within the U.S. national security community, the term describes how the physical impacts of climate change interact with and exacerbate pre-existing social, economic, and political vulnerabilities, thereby multiplying threats to peace and stability. While the framework has been instrumental in placing climate change on the security agenda, it is also critiqued for potentially constraining policy responses to a reactive, management-oriented posture rather than promoting transformative change. This study employs a qualitative, comparative case study methodology to deconstruct the threat multiplier effect through its cascading impacts. It first analyzes the first-order impact of climate change on critical resources, with a focus on water stress in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It then investigates the secondorder human consequence of climate-induced migration, examining patterns in the Sahel, Bangladesh, and Central America, and highlighting the profound legal and geopolitical challenges posed by the lack of international protection for \"climate refugees.\" Finally, through in-depth case studies of Syria and Sudan, the article analyzes how these combined pressures can culminate in the third-order outcome of political instability and violent conflict. The analysis reveals that governance is the critical mediating variable determining whether climate stress leads to instability. The article concludes by assessing the policy responses of the United Nations, European Union, and the United States, identifying key gaps, and advocating for an integrated policy framework that merges climate adaptation, development, and peacebuilding to address the multifaceted nature of climate-related security risks."}}

These zones, legally established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), grant sovereign rights over marine resources up to 200 nautical miles from a nation's coast. For Pacific nations, this translates into enormous geopolitical and economic significance. EEZs provide access to abundant fisheries, potential seabed minerals, and maritime tourism opportunities, forming the backbone of what is increasingly referred to as the \"Blue Economy.\" Beyond economic dimensions, these maritime zones offer strategic leverage in regional diplomacy, security partnerships, and ocean governance. This article explores how EEZs have evolved into critical assets for the Pacific Islands, enabling them to assert international presence, generate state revenue, and safeguard ecological sovereignty. Through policy analysis and comparative case studies, it reveals the dual function of EEZs as both economic lifelines and strategic tools. The study also highlights key challenges such as illegal fishing, capacity deficits in marine surveillance, and overreliance on foreign actors. Ultimately, it argues that the full realization of EEZ benefits depends on integrated governance, regional cooperation, and sustainable resource management practices tailored to small island contexts."}}

This article examines the multifaceted drivers and far-reaching consequences of demographic expansion in Chad, employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates demographic statistics, socioeconomic indicators, and policy analysis. The study identifies high fertility ratesaveraging 6.3 births per woman-as the principal driver of population growth, rooted in a complex interplay of cultural norms, limited access to reproductive health services, and low levels of female education. Contributing factors include a predominantly rural economy reliant on subsistence agriculture, where large family size is traditionally valued for labor, and persistent gender inequality that restricts women's autonomy in reproductive decision-making. The demographic momentum is further sustained by declining mortality rates, attributable to modest improvements in healthcare access and reductions in infant and child mortality, despite ongoing challenges in disease control and nutrition. The consequences of this rapid demographic expansion are wide-ranging. Economically, population growth places severe strain on limited public resources, exacerbating unemployment, underemployment, and income inequality. Education and healthcare systems struggle to keep pace with rising demand, resulting in overcrowded classrooms, insufficient teaching personnel, and inadequate medical infrastructure. Environmentally, the expansion accelerates land degradation, deforestation, and water scarcity, intensifying competition over natural resources and contributing to rural-urban migration. Socially and politically, rapid population growth amplifies pressures on governance structures, fuels intercommunal tensions-particularly over land and water-and complicates efforts toward national stability in a context already marked by fragility and conflict. The analysis underscores the urgent need for integrated policy interventions aimed at moderating population growth while maximizing the potential demographic dividend. Recommended strategies include expanding access to family planning and reproductive health services, investing in female education, promoting economic diversification beyond subsistence agriculture, and implementing sustainable resource management practices. The study concludes that without decisive and coordinated action, Chad's demographic trajectory risks deepening existing socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities, undermining prospects for long-term development and stability. Conversely, strategic investment in human capital and resource governance could enable the country to transform demographic pressures into a driver of inclusive growth."}}

In contrast to the conventional wisdom in the macro literature, the introduction of on-the-job search implies that: (i) the wage rigidity of incumbent workers, rather than new hires, is the critical determinant of unemployment fluctuations; (ii) fairness considerations in wage setting dampen, rather than amplify, unemployment fluctuations; and (iii) new hire wages are too flexible, rather than too rigid, in the decentralized equilibrium.

Our findings indicate that both supervisors and calibration committees generally follow the principles of information economics. When aggregating multi-rater assessments, supervisors assess the informativeness of different assessments and place more weight on more informative assessments. However, our results also reveal limitations in information processing. Under conditions of high information load, supervisors appear to rely on cognitive shortcuts, engaging less in detailed weighting decisions based on the informativeness of individual multi-rater assessments. Regarding calibration, we find that committees are less likely to adjust supervisors' aggregation decisions when those decisions are consistent with more informative multi-rater assessments and when supervisors provide well-substantiated justifications, highlighting the complementary roles of multi-rater systems and calibration. Additionally, calibration committees appear to strategically focus on cases where supervisors face a high information load and information sources that may not have been fully incorporated into the initial performance ratings."}}

But one critical question remains—how and when courts should engage in a different type of review: the deferential “arbitrary and capricious” standard. In applying this standard post-Loper Bright, courts face a dual risk. First, they may be too hard on government agencies and end up substituting the policy judgments of the court for those of agency experts; State Farm arbitrariness review should be highly deferential. But second, if they engage in this deferential review too early in the process—merging it together with de novo legal review—they may be committing the sin of Chevron and deferring to agencies on legal questions of statutory construction. To avoid this pitfall, this paper lays out a simple formula for courts, combining a decades-long review of statutory and judicial history with an application of the Supreme Court’s most recent decisions.</p>\n<p>This article makes two arguments.&nbsp; First, leaning on cases from before the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act to the present, this paper argues that State Farm arbitrariness review should be extremely deferential to agency decision making. So long as the agency’s action is “reasonable and reasonably explained,” then courts have no role in substituting their own judgment for that of the agency’s. Second, the Supreme Court was clear in both Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and an even-more recent case, Seven County Infrastructure v. Eagle County, that de novo legal review and deferential arbitrariness review are two distinct and different steps. If a court conflates the two steps—and some have—it will smuggle deference into legal review and risk a Chevron redux.</p>\n<p>Using hypotheticals and real-life cases, including Loper Bright and its sister case Relentless on remand, this paper establishes a clear path for courts to follow. This paper’s recommendation might seem paradoxical: courts should both go easier on agencies when reviewing discretionary decision making for arbitrariness, while being stricter when analyzing whether an agency is behaving lawfully. But this is consistent with the Supreme Court’s guidance—courts must sharply distinguish these two steps and their differing standards of review.&nbsp;</p>"}}

By applying a logit model and a local projection difference-in-differences approach, we provide new insights into the allocation mechanisms of EU Cohesion Policy funds and their firm-level impact. Our findings show that funding tends to be allocated to firms that already perform relatively well, and that firms receiving EU funding experience a persistent productivity increase of approximately 3% after 4 years, with smaller and more financially constrained firms experiencing relatively greater improvements. Moreover, funding targeting “SME investment” tends to enhance firm performance disproportionately more than other categories, whereas projects directed the “green transition” appear comparatively less beneficial."}}

We provide a definition of the digital twin concept and examine its significance in the context of personalized education and experiential learning. Practical implementation models that demonstrate how digital twins facilitate realistic budgeting simulations and risk management scenarios are presented in conjunction with a review of theoretical frameworks (e.g., simulation-based learning and learning analytics). We present case studies and pilot programs from a variety of regions, such as academic-industry collaborations, school-based financial literacy simulations, and fintech-driven initiatives, to illustrate the global scope of these applications. The technological infrastructure (including real-time data integration and AI-driven learner analytics) and pedagogical models (including adaptive feedback loops and experiential learning) that are facilitated by digital twins are examined. We also address the implications for key stakeholders, including educators who acquire powerful new tools for engagement and assessment, learners who benefit from immersive and personalized practice environments, financial institutions and EdTech developers who see new opportunities for innovation, and policymakers who encounter both opportunities and challenges in scaling such models. The paper is organized as a formal research exposition, consisting of an introduction to the background literature, a comprehensive discussion, the methodology of analysis, and conclusions. Our objective is to develop a future-ready EdTech model that emphasizes the development of financial acumen through the integration of current research and practice. This work is positioned to contribute to the discourse on EdTech innovations in financial education by optimizing scholarly engagement through the use of tone and structure."}}

Building on a provocative theory circulating among policymakers, it explores the possibility that President Trump’s second-term tariff strategy aimed not merely at confronting foreign adversaries, but at reshaping external balances, stabilizing bond markets, and reducing reliance on foreign capital inflows. At the same time, the use of hidden, regressive tariffs helped to subsidize and sustain large-scale tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy, shifting the fiscal burden onto ordinary consumers without legislative transparency or consent.</p>\n<p>Whether or not this theory fully captures the administration’s intent, the constitutional and institutional dangers it reveals are profound. By repurposing tariffs to achieve fiscal objectives, the executive branch constructs a system of hidden, regressive taxation that bypasses Congress’s exclusive authority under Article I of the U.S. Constitution. This practice severs the constitutional link between taxation and democratic accountability, replacing transparent lawmaking with opaque executive discretion. Tariffs, once instruments of trade policy, become de facto taxes imposed without public debate, statutory clarity, or procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p>Beyond domestic concerns, this Article situates the phenomenon within the broader framework of international law.

It models legal ethics as a three-faced structure—professional role, common morality, and political philosophy—so that conflicts among them can be diagnosed rather than obscured. Methodologically, it draws on applied ethics. Substantively, it builds on Michael Pritchard’s&nbsp;<em>Professional Integrity</em>&nbsp;to connect subjective deliberation (virtue, character, conscience) with objective, action-guiding standards for professional conduct, and to foreground “good work” as well as the prevention of misconduct. It also engages David Luban’s&nbsp;<em>Lawyers and Justice</em>—especially his account of “neutral partisanship” as the conjunction of partisanship with moral neutrality within an adversary system—to specify what can and cannot be bracketed by role obligations. The analysis clarifies (i) defense counsel’s neutral partisanship vis-à-vis judicial impartiality; (ii) prosecutorial ethics as a dual mandate in which role-based duties and system-facing duties diverge under adversarial stress; and (iii) judicial ethics that calibrate discipline for legal error without chilling independence. To justify institutional departures from common morality, the study favors a “cumulative-weight” test over “minimum-threshold” algorithms, aligning institutional defenses with reason-giving that is sensitive to moral salience. Case studies (the Lake Pleasant and Alton Logan matters) demonstrate preventive and aspirational payoffs—showing how the framework organizes hard cases, guides role-conflict decisions, and makes professional reasoning intelligible to non-lawyers. Overall, the project integrates Pritchard’s virtue-centered integrity with Luban’s institutional analysis to yield an evaluative vocabulary and decision tools for comparative and pedagogical use in legal ethics.</p>\n<p><span><br>\n   * This is identical to the version available at&nbsp;</span><a rel=\"nofollow\">https://doi.org/10.15057/83104</a></p>"}}

While the discussion focuses on India’s strategic and legal context, the framework is relevant for emerging UAV operators seeking to integrate responsible AI into military operations. These systems could incorporate an internal “conscience,” asking questions such as: Is this target lawful under international law? Are we certain? Could civilians be nearby?

In addition, some US state and Canadian provincial challenge mechanisms arguably comply with a minimal interpretation of Article XVIIL but not with a more robust, purposive interpretation. In other words, US state and Canadian provincial domestic review procedures help to reveal a host of ambiguities in the text of Article XVIII Some of these ambiguities may have been apparent to the negotiators who drafted the text and may reflect deliberate attempts to accommodate diverse national legal systems. We suspect, however, that some other ambiguities may not have been widely understood at the time the text was adopted.

The system introduces twelve foundational innovations spanning from cultural ethnographic NLP to hybrid quantum-classical voting, achieving 35% latency reduction, 92% confidence in black-box AGI modeling, and sub-15-minute cross-domain emergency coordination while maintaining 0.8+ cultural authenticity across diverse knowledge systems. Through comprehensive evaluation across medical, financial, and transportation emergency scenarios, we demonstrate that integrated governance architectures can simultaneously address seemingly contradictory requirements: rapid emergency response with democratic deliberation, cultural diversity with universal principles, and proprietary systems with transparent accountability.

Specifically, each agent provides two point predictions, namely a direct prediction of the quantity of interest and a peer prediction of the average of the others' direct predictions. Our proposed conversion from point predictions to a probabilistic aggregate is straightforward: It has a closed-form solution, involves no tuning parameters, is efficient under the well-known normally distributed information structure, and outperforms benchmark methods across both synthetic and real-world data."}}

The factors are estimated using category-specific personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data on prices and quantities, using a sign-restricted dynamic factor model that imposes theoretical predictions of the effects of fluctuations in supply and demand on prices and associated quantities through factor loadings. The resulting estimates are used to decompose total PCE inflation into contributions from common factors—goods demand, goods supply, services demand, services supply, and inflation expectations—and category specific idiosyncratic components. Validation exercises demonstrate that the estimated factors provide an informative and coherent narrative of inflation dynamics over time and can be effectively used for forecasting and policy analysis."}}
