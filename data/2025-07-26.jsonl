However, FL systems have low resource utilization on servers and devices, limiting their practical use in the real world. This inefficiency primarily arises from two types of idle time: (i) task dependency between the server and devices, and (ii) stragglers among heterogeneous devices. This paper introduces FedOptima, a resource-optimized FL system designed to simultaneously minimize both types of idle time; existing systems do not eliminate or reduce both at the same time. FedOptima offloads the training of certain layers of a neural network from a device to a server using three innovations. First, devices operate independently of each other using asynchronous aggregation to eliminate straggler effects, and independently of the server by utilizing auxiliary networks to minimize idle time caused by task dependency. Second, the server performs centralized training using a task scheduler that ensures balanced contributions from all devices, improving model accuracy. Third, an efficient memory management mechanism on the server increases the scalability of the number of participating devices. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple lab-based testbeds, evaluated on image classification and sentiment analysis tasks with CNNs and Transformers. Compared to four state-of-the-art offloading-based and asynchronous FL baselines, FedOptima (i) achieves higher or comparable accuracy, (ii) accelerates training by 1.9x to 21.8x, (iii) reduces server and device idle time by up to 93.9% and 81.8%, respectively, and (iv) increases throughput by 1.1x to 2.0x."}}

We further explore this finding through supplemental analyses and provide evidence that compensation is more sensitive to performance captured in earnings announcements and that the timing effect is concentrated in busy boards. While we do not provide direct evidence of the thought process employed by board members, our pattern of results is consistent with the cognitive bias of anchoring where individuals place too much weight on initial information."}}

We also document pricing behavior that is more consistent with consumer power: airlines absorb a larger portion of commodity cost increases than they enjoy commodity cost decreases. Further, the periods of airline pricing power and consumer power correlate rationally with the changes in the economic environment within the airline industry. Managers offset margins eroded by commodity fuel cost increases by reducing employee compensation, increasing long-term debt, and by depleting cash reserves. Retained cost savings reverse some of those trends."}}

However, conventional multi-objective optimization models typically focus on individual flood control measures, overlooking pumping stations due to complex system interactions and uncertain synergies. Furthermore, the hydrological models coupled with optimization algorithms necessitate exceptionally high standards for data quantity, quality, and precision. To address this issue, this study proposes a multi-objective phased optimization framework with water surface ratio and green measures as decision variables, while incorporating pumping station design discharge determined through fitting relationships, focusing on the objectives of annual total cost (ATC) and runoff volume reduction rate (RVRR). Phase I optimization is particularly suitable for preliminary planning in data-scarce regions, and its determined decision variable ranges served as boundary constraints for the Phase Ⅱ spatial layout optimization. A case study was conducted in Handan, Hebei Province, China. The Results demonstrate that pumping stations enable rapid river discharge in limited green-blue infrastructure space, effectively controlling water levels below 5.1m. The decision variables corresponding to Phase I optimization are 16.09~37.13 m3/s pumping station drainage flow, 1% lake and 5% river water surface ratios, 31.6%~69% sunken green space, and 10%~26.4% permeable pavement ratios, respectively, establishing scientifical constraints for Phase II spatial optimization. This multi-objective phased optimization framework comprehensively accounts for the synergistic effects of GGBI and offers innovative solutions for flood mitigation optimization in data-scarce regions, contributing significantly to the resilience enhancement of urban drainage systems."}}

Specifically, we analyze TLT compensation along two dimensions: (1) the size of the CEO pay slice, reflecting payment for the CEO’s team leadership and management skill, and (2) the degree of pay dispersion among the CEO’s executive team, capturing the extent to which payment is based on team versus individual effort. Our findings, based on analysis of a longitudinal sample, show that, on average, TLTs characterized by a larger CEO pay slice and lower degree of pay dispersion among the CEO’s top team outperform other combinations in terms of return on assets. Our analysis of DuPont components indicates that higher slice and lower dispersion outperform other combinations for customer value (profit margin) while lower slice and lower dispersion outperform other combinations for operating efficiency (asset turnover). Overall, our results highlight the complementary relations between CEO team leadership and team-based compensation in rewarding TLTs."}}

Flight paths frequently deviate due to factors such as flight intentions, environmental conditions, and aircraft performance. Accurate forecasting of these paths is essential for enhancing flight safety and ensuring the safety of the aircraft. To address the issue of inaccurate track predictions in out-of-field environments, a CNN-Transformer-BiGRU hybrid model was employed. This model incorporates high-dimensional feature engineering, including physical constraints such as the thrust-to-weight ratio and rate of heading change, and introduces an explicit labeling mechanism for turning points based on the rate of change in the heading angle. The framework was validated using a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) departure dataset from the Dalian Zhoushuizi Airport. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to other baseline models, the proposed framework reduced the longitude RMSE and MAE by 93.77% and 94.46%, respectively, whereas the errors in latitude and altitude decreased by over 80% and 89%, respectively. The proposed framework has good practicability in the terminal airspace of airports, which can support the high-precision prediction of departure tracks and the design of protected areas. It is also applicable to track prediction tasks at busy airports and in environments with frequent flight changes."}}

The approach is grounded in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and utilizes the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to encode European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification Specifications (CS), including Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC), in a structured digital model. The proposed methodology aims to significantly reduce certification time and costs, thereby improving the competitiveness of the general aviation market and enabling the development of entirely new aircraft categories.

This study experimentally compares these methods to examine conditions under which their stochastic rankings converge. Using a simulated decision problem, we vary the number of alternatives, criteria, and uncertainty levels, assessing similarity through Kendall’s tau and top-rank agreement. Results show that correlation improves with more alternatives, but decreases with more criteria, especially between SMAA-PROMETHEE and SMAA-TODIM, along with reduced agreement on top-ranked alternatives.

Drawing inspiration from sportsmanship, corporatemanship emphasizes the ethical dispositions and virtues that define responsible corporate behavior, including fairness, integrity, and civic responsibility. It provides a unifying framework that addresses the limitations of current CSR models, shifting the focus from instrumental motives to an ethical, virtue-driven approach. By grounding the concept in virtue ethics and institutional theory, this paper offers a robust theoretical lens through which corporate behavior can be understood as a moral practice, not just a strategic one. This concept has significant implications for corporate governance, organizational culture, and the broader discourse on business ethics.The fragmentation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business ethics has been a persistent issue in both academic and practical discourse (Gond & Moon, 2011; Scherer & Palazzo, 2007). CSR has often been approached as a strategy for managing risks, building reputation, and addressing stakeholder concerns (Carroll, 1999; Freeman, 1984), while business ethics engages with more fundamental moral questions regarding right and wrong (Solomon, 1992). Although both fields seek to guide corporate behavior, the lack of a unifying ethical framework has limited their ability to address the underlying ethical principles that govern corporate actions. This article introduces corporatemanship, a concept that merges these fields by offering a normative framework grounded in virtue ethics.By drawing an analogy to sportsmanship, corporatemanship advocates for a set of ethical dispositions that enable corporations to engage with society in a manner that reflects fairness, integrity, civic responsibility, and respect for stakeholders. This approach challenges the prevailing instrumentalist view of CSR and repositions corporate responsibility as a moral imperative, grounded in the virtuous practices of individual and collective actors within organizations. In doing so, corporatemanship offers a fresh perspective on how corporations can become moral agents in society."}}

The players have limited total contributions or capacities for forming links at every stage which can differ among players and over time. They cannot delete links, but the principle of natural elimination of links with no contribution is adopted. Next, we assume that the players simultaneously and independently propose links to other players and have overall limited capacities for the whole game, and not for each stage. This means that every player can redistribute the capacity not only over links, but also over time. The equilibrium concept for the first version of the dynamic game is subgame perfect equilibrium, while it is the Nash equilibrium in open-loop strategies for the second version. Both models are illustrated with numerical examples."}}

It was tested in an industrial context using a complex product (Variable Refrigerant Flow system – VRF) that includes more than 2,000 data points. As the algorithmic implementation is confidential, the study focuses on the methodological principles and experimental results.ResultsThe method enabled a reduction in modeling time from approximately 7 days (manual approach) to just 52 minutes (automated approach). This gain in productivity is driven by automation, which eliminates repetitive tasks that are often source of error.Conclusion and discussionThis research proposes an automated method to accelerate the generation of Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), demonstrating strong potential for large-scale industrial deployment. However, the criteria of consistency, reproducibility, and precision still need to be validated to fully confirm the potential of the automated approach."}}

At present, the free-rider problem hampers global collective action; the world needs better mechanisms to incentivize bolder climate policy. Toward this end, we suggest a heavy industry climate coalition. Countries would \"join\" the coalition by committing to apply a carbon fee (or an equivalent emissions trading system) to emissions-heavy industries, and they would couple that fee with a carbon border adjustment mechanism. We suggest a tiered pricing approach that would be sensitive to countries' economic development levels to broaden coalition participation. The coalition would pair the carbon-pricing mechanism with other inducements for members, including market access, climate finance commitments, and technology transfer agreements. We estimate that a heavy industry climate coalition has the potential to reduce worldwide emissions substantially, acting as a stepping stone for further international climate cooperation. \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Note: Reprinted with permission.

This paper investigates the crucial, yet underexplored, role of public trust in central banks as a moderator in the relationship between social media sentiment and aggregate consumer spending, particularly within emerging economies. While central bank transparency is generally beneficial, its amplification through digital platforms introduces complexities such as heightened scrutiny, rapid misinformation dissemination, and potential erosion of trust. A significant research gap exists in understanding how institutional trust precisely modulates the transmission of digital public opinion into real economic behavior, especially in contexts like Egypt, where empirical investigation is limited and nuanced Arabic sentiment analysis poses methodological challenges. This study aims to empirically quantify this moderating effect and develop evidence-based policy recommendations. Employing a quantitative, time-series design, the research will utilize meticulously constructed social media sentiment indices for Egypt (January 2018–December 2024), aggregate consumer spending data from official sources, and a composite index of public trust in the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). Vector Autoregression <b>(VAR) models</b>, incorporating interaction terms, will analyze dynamic interdependencies and the moderating role of trust, complemented by Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity <b>(GARCH)</b> models for volatility analysis. Robustness checks will ensure the reliability of findings. Expected results include a statistically significant relationship between social media sentiment and consumer spending, with high CBE trust attenuating the impact of extreme sentiment and low trust amplifying it. This research will underscore the imperative for central banks to strategically manage public perception and trust in the digital sphere, transforming communication into a potent tool for macroeconomic stability.</span></p>"}}

In the present era, the number of these sciences and arts has reached up to 30. After the partition of Subcontinent, this curriculum has been formally taught in many religious madrasas of Pakistan and as a result, the graduates here were not playing any significant role in the development of the country due to the lack of flexibility in the curriculum. Therefore, during the period of General Zia-ul-Haq, some technical changes were made in the curriculum like some modern arts such as English language, Mathematics, Pakistan Studies etc. were made part of the curriculum and the degree of these graduates was made equal to MA Arabic &amp; Islamic Studies. Now, in the recent past, during the tenure of Prime Minister Imran Khan, emphasis was placed on One Nation Curriculum and the religious madrasas were also required to include modern arts in their curriculum. Therefore, in this regard, the establishment of some new religious boards was also implemented in which Kanz Al-Madaris Board has a very important rule due to its wider range of books included in the curriculum of Dars e Nizami. And further this board's syllabus along with exams pattern is pretty much as per HEC rules and regulations. So, we will compare in this study the books of Dars e Nizami included in Kanz Al-Madaris with the curriculum of HEC so that the current targets of religious madaris can be seemed and compared based on future goals in this modern era. This will be the first comparative research that will prompt religious boards individually to try to adapt their curriculum to the requirements of modern era."}}

This study aimed to predict type-specific influenza incidence using viral RNA concentrations in wastewater. The RNA concentrations of influenza A and B viruses were measured in weekly wastewater samples collected from three treatment plants in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, between April 2023 and April 2025. Influenza cases in the target catchment were apportioned by type using pathogen surveillance data. Models were developed to separately predict influenza A and B cases per sentinel health surveillance based on viral RNA concentrations in wastewater for the first 69 weeks using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Their performance was then validated over the subsequent 31 weeks. Type-specific influenza cases were predicted with high accuracy (R 2 = 0.859 for influenza A+B cases during the validation period). Furthermore, dummy variables representing a non-outbreak level in the previous week showed negative correlations with the observed values, suggesting that wastewater signals may reflect the true infection incidence regardless of the availability of clinical testing. Influenza incidence estimation through wastewaterbased epidemiology is useful for public health measures such as hospital bed allocation because it can provide information approximately one week earlier than clinical data publications."}}

This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the phytochemical diversity and pharmacological potential of Z. armatum. The plant is rich in bioactive constituents including alkaloids (e.g., berberine, chelerythrine), flavonoids, terpenoids, glycosides, phenolics, tannins, and essential oils containing compounds such as linalool, limonene, and β-caryophyllene. Scientific studies have demonstrated its broad-spectrum antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic, and gastroprotective properties. In addition, emerging evidence supports its roles in immunomodulation, neuroprotection, and potential anticancer activity. Traditional and modern dosage practices are discussed along with considerations for safety, toxicity, and regulatory aspects. Despite its therapeutic promise, gaps remain in clinical validation, standardization, and toxicity profiling. The chapter emphasizes the need for integrated research efforts to fully harness the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical potential of Z. armatum while promoting its sustainable utilization and conservation."}}

These slopes exert shear stress on shallow-buried coal seams and overlying strata at the slope toe, leading to fracturing and crack propagation. This structural damage facilitates spontaneous combustion of the coal seam, forming coal fire zones that significantly increase the risk of dump slope instability. To address this geotechnical hazard, this study proposes a control technique—the slope toe counterweight method—for preventing coal fires at the toe of dump slopes. Based on Coulomb earth pressure theory, analytical formulas for the geometric design of the counterweight platform are derived to support engineering applications. A case study from an open-pit coal mine in Xinjiang, China, is presented. Field investigations combined with numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the formation mechanisms of coal fires at the waste dump slope toe and their effects on slope stability. The proposed method was implemented in the open-pit mine, and its performance was evaluated. Results demonstrate that the counterweight platform effectively reduces shear deformation, suppresses crack development, and blocks oxygen ingress, thereby controlling coal fire spread and mitigating slope instability risks. Additionally, the method significantly enhances slope stability. This study offers a practical, economical, and efficient engineering solution for coal fire prevention at dump slope toes and provides theoretical and technical support for coal fire mitigation in arid-region open-pit mines."}}

By treating text descriptions as auxiliary training samples, our method enables effective and scalable augmentation without generating synthetic images. We introduce a training strategy called Alternating-Modality Supervision (AMS), where vision and text samples alternately supervise a shared classifier. We further observe that vision and text favor different loss functions: cross-entropy (CE) for vision and mean squared error (MSE) for text. Based on this, we propose Modality-Preference Loss Assignment (MPLA), which aligns each modality with its preferred objective and improves optimization stability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and backbone architectures confirm that combining MPLA with AMS improves few-shot performance and demonstrates strong generalizability."}}

HQD systematically decomposes questions into multi-granular representations to capture layered language biases, while EM leverages bias confidence to modulate per-sample decision margins dynamically. Our method integrates generative bias modeling with adaptive margin learning in an end-to-end trainable architecture. Experiments on VQA benchmarks demonstrate that HQD-EM significantly outperforms prior work and achieves state-of-the-art results on VQA-CP2 and VQA-CP1."}}

Despite substantial research on the impacts of fracking on various economic outcomes, the literature has been largely silent on the subject of regulation. Fracking has been largely exempted from federal environmental legislation. This has allowed state and local governments to regulate fracking activities with a high level of heterogeneity, which ranges from passing resolutions that do not have actual consequences to outright bans. Over the ten years between 2009 and 2018, the number of local regulations increased from 12 to 387. We examine what drives local fracking policies, with a focus on the role of nonprofit environmental organizations in the passing of such regulations. We constructed a novel panel data set that includes information on the presence of fracking regulation in each community and on the activities of environmental groups. We develop a two-way fixed effects model to estimate the effect of environmental groups on the likelihood of a community adopting fracking regulations. Our results show that the presence of environmental groups and their expenditures increase the likelihood of communities adopting fracking regulations."}}

Second, we employ the masked language model (MLM) header in the autoencoder LM to map the query representation to implicitly topic-related tokens as keywords. We combine these two approaches to augment the original query. Extensive experiments on four prevalent open-domain question answering (ODQA) datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an average of 4.26% improvement in R@20 compared to state-ofthe- art query expansion work.

We find that HSR’s construction phase, often involving ‘feeder’ roads, raised deforestation by 0.2% per year on average (higher for early construction years). In contrast, operation of HSR did not harm forest, on average. For the relatively rare HSR areas with low forest cover, deforestation from construction was higher (~ 0.5% per year) and this additional forest loss continued during operation. These findings suggest that targeted HSR siting, combined with care during construction, can yield high speed with low impact."}}

To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid classification framework combining commercial API-served large language models (C-LLMs) and open-source fine-tunable pre-trained language models (F-PLMs) to classify 31 diverse disaster types. We first automatically labeled 56,563 stratified news headlines from 2.77 million articles using two C-LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and Gemini-2.0 Flash-Lite). Human reviewers manually adjudicated only discrepant cases (19.1%), significantly reducing manual labeling effort. This labeled dataset was then used to fine-tune two transformer-based F-PLMs (BERT and KoELECTRA), which were combined into a soft-voting ensemble. The ensemble achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.9589, closely approaching the best-performing C-LLM (Gemini, 0.9817). Temporal analysis of classified news articles showed strong alignment with 92 official activation dates of Korea’s Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, validating the framework’s real-world applicability. The proposed hybrid approach is currently utilized by Korea’s National Disaster Management Research Institute for real-time disaster news monitoring and serves as one of the essential references for governmental disaster-budget prioritization."}}

However, the severity of exacerbated labor underinvestment is more pronounced and offsets the benefits of alleviated labor underinvestment, ultimately leading to labor investment inefficiency. The post-IPO liquidity and empire-building effects explain the labor investment inefficiency. Heterogeneity analysis reveals the reduced labor investment efficiency post-IPO is more pronounced among non-SOEs, firms with higher cost of borrowing and poorer corporate governance, and those with pre-IPO suspension and favorable pre-IPO market performance. Further analysis indicates the inefficiency of labor investment post-IPO tends to hinder the long-term financial performance, triggering post-IPO performance reversal."}}

Modern variants employ sophisticated encryption techniques, selective file targeting, and rapid execution strategies, leaving victims with minimal response time. Yet, limited research compares the performance of different strains in terms of encryption speed, execution efficiency, and system impact factors vital for effective attack prevention and mitigation. Current studies focus largely on detection and mitigation, with little attention to ransomware&apos;s operational efficiency. The absence of standardised, freely available, datasets further impedes comparative benchmarking, and recent advancements in encryption methods necessitate updated evaluations of execution times, speeds, and resource utilisation. This study addresses these gaps through a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of active ransomware threats. A novel dataset of 29 active ransomware strains was developed, and a controlled testing environment was established to systematically analyse their execution behaviour. A structured target dataset simulating real-world file systems was also created to facilitate robust comparative analysis. Key performance metrics, including encryption speed, execution time, and thread utilisation were evaluated using these datasets within a virtualised, isolated test environment. The dataset generation followed best practice principles, ensuring reproducibility and both datasets are freely available to the research community. Empirical results reveal significant variations, with encryption speeds ranging from 33 MB/s to 2.79 GB/s. The fastest strain, Trigona, achieved an encryption rate 84 times higher than the slowest, CL0P, highlighting diverse optimisation strategies. Distinct behavioural patterns, such as pre-encryption delays and multi-threading utilisation, substantially influence performance, offering critical insights into ransomware evolution and underscoring the need for adaptive defences.

The exploration of tillage methods and corresponding fertilization modes aimed at enhancing maize nitrogen use efficiency and economic benefits, while reducing environmental costs in this region. A field experiment (2021-2022) employed two principal factors: A) Tillage systems: The differences between strip–till (RST) and conventional ridge cropping (CP), straw off-field no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with straw mulching (RNT) were comparatively investigated in the conventional fertilizer (Sd) mode. B) Fertilization regimes under RST: conventional fertilization (Sd), controlled–release urea blends (30%Cr, 50%Cr), and nitrogen–free control. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and Z-score analysis were used to evaluate environmental impacts, yield, nitrogen use efficiency, economic benefits, and overall maize production performance. RST significantly outperformed CP by 46.6% in yield, 62.0% in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and 8.2% in net economic benefits. Concurrently, demonstrated 4.9% and 4.7% reductions in Carbon and Nr footprints respectively. Under strip-till, the 50%Cr treatment increased yield, NUE, and net economic benefits by 48.9%, 8.8%, and 11.9% over Sd; reduced nitrogen loss, NH3 volatilization, and N2O emissions by 21.3%, 52.0%, and 8.6%; and lowered Carbon and Nr footprints by 11.4% and 38.9%, respectively. This study shows that RST combined with 50%Cr boosts yield and reduces environmental impacts in rainfed maize systems, offering practical solutions for ecological intensification and sustainable development in Northeast China&apos;s fragile agroecosystems."}}

To address this, we propose a new preprocessing method that converts skeletal data into Gaussian-Blurred Connected Heatmaps (GBCH), apply a masked autoencoder on GBCH, and design a multi-modal transformer model with hybrid attention. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art 2D HAR models in both static and moving-camera scenarios."}}

Estimated pay ratios track closely before 2015 but differ by roughly 67 percent following the rule’s adoption—two years before companies were first required to disclose—suggesting that firms began adjusting after regulatory certainty, not implementation. The effect concentrates in consumer-facing firms and those led by younger CEOs, consistent with reputational risk and customer pressure. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the view that even a simple, non-monetary disclosure requirement can coincide with narrower pay gaps ahead of formal implementation, particularly where reputational channels are strong."}}

By analyzing the number of publicly available Call Report items accessible to depositors and examining uninsured deposit flows at a macro level for each quarter from 1991 to 2024, this study provides evidence that the expansion of Call Reports leads to an increase in the volume of uninsured deposit flows. This effect is particularly noticeable in smaller banks, banks with lower capital ratios and weaker loan portfolio quality, as well as privately held banks. A classification of the disclosures reveals that the disaggregation of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet activities is the primary driver of this effect."}}

Using detailed removal data, we estimated the cost of land trapping wild pigs to be $200 per pig, which is substantially less than the cost of pig damage without trapping.  Using data from both land trapping and aerial gunning, we estimate each pig removal within 1km of a property to be associated with a large reduction (approximately 40%-60%) of damages, per pig removed.

First, we propose VariShaPE (Varifold Shape Parameter Estimator), a novel architecture for the retrieval of latent space representations of body shapes and poses. This network offers a fast and robust method to estimate the embedding of arbitrary unregistered meshes into the latent space. Second, we complement the estimation of latent codes with MoGeN (Motion Geometry Network) a framework that learns the geometry on the latent space itself. This is achieved by lifting the body pose parameter space into a higher dimensional Euclidean space in which body motion mini-sequences from a training set of 4D data can be approximated by simple linear interpolation. Using the SMPL latent space representation we illustrate how the combination of these network models, once trained, can be used to perform a variety of tasks with very limited computational cost. This includes operations such as motion interpolation, extrapolation and transfer as well as random shape and pose generation."}}

On the other hand, data uncertainty significantly impacts portfolio selection and affects optimal weights and then optimal decisions for small perturbations of the joint distribution parameters. We propose to formulate the mean-expectile portfolio optimization problem under a distributionally robust framework induced by the Wasserstein metric. The resulting robustified model with random variables supposed to be discretely supported reduces to a linear program for a given risk-return trade-off parameter, irrespective to the norm used in the Wasserstein metric needed to define the corresponding uncertainty set, and therefore, it is computationally efficient. We further carry out an extensive set of computational investigations under two different norms, l1 and l2, across four global financial markets featuring distributionally robust portfolios with expectile risk measures. As a result, the proposed robust model outperforms the nominal counterpart, showing stable investment gains. However, when compared to the distributionally robust version of the much popular Mean-Conditional Value-at-Risk portfolio optimization model, the performance seems to depend on the underlying norm taken in the definition of their respective Wasserstein uncertainty set."}}

Therefore, this paper designs an LGD-driven interpretable model framework for farmers’ credit risk feature selection. According to two groups of real farmers’ loan data from different commercial banks, it is found that the framework designed in this paper has stronger ability to identify default risk than the traditional default status-driven model. And we found that the feature under the repayment ability criterion layer have the highest impact on farmers’ default losses."}}

Existing methods often lack the capacity to systematically model such behavioral diversity, limiting their applicability for rigorous evaluation of AV. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that generates diverse interactive traffic through Estimation-Guided Policy Optimization (EGPO). Central to EGPO is the Equilibrium Value Estimation (EVE), a learnable hyperparameter that weights the outputs of the rational value function and the adversarial value function, reconstructing the policy&apos;s estimation of the expected reward. Notably, EVE is globally updated using meta-learning during policy learning. Furthermore, an EVE-guided policy network is used to feature multi-head architectures that efficiently process high-dimensional multi-agent observations while dynamically prioritizing context-specific features aligned with the learned EVEs.Extensive experiments conducted in both urban and highway scenarios demonstrate that EGPO produces traffic environments with enhanced behavioral controllability and diversity. Furthermore, EGPO excels in the closed-loop AV testing on OnSite benchmark, outperforming SOTA methods based on deep learning and rule-based  in terms of both realism and testing efficiency. Overall, EGPO offers a scalable and robust solution for simulating realistic interactions among diverse driving tendencies, facilitating the development of AV systems capable of handling complex real-world corner cases."}}

However, measuring transparency remains a challenge due to the ambiguous nature of human language. Traditional measurement approaches rely on binary or categorical dimensions, which can lead to limited insights and inaccurate policy decisions. To address this challenge, we develop a transparency indicator based on multiple metrics. On the one hand, fuzzy metrics are employed to quantify categorical dimensions; on the other hand, standard metrics are used to compute the overall transparency indicator. The notion of transparency is contrary to the binary principle of having a property or not, that is, to be transparent or not. In our case, we apply a novel methodology designed for formative measurement and partially compensatory models using a set of qualitative dimensions. This tool provides a measure of how close (observations close to 1) or far (observations close to 0) each observation (in this setting, the municipality) is from the analyzed concept. This is calculated for each indicator while preserving the metric structure. In the municipality setting, this approach captures the complexity of transparency and can better identify areas for improvement in local governments. In a second step, we analyze the political, economic, and social determinants of this transparency index, relying on spatial econometric techniques to account for spatial dependencies and to ensure the accuracy of our findings. We use a novel dataset that comprehensively measures transparency at the municipal level in the Valencian region. As far as we know, this is the first database that covers all municipalities in the region. By capturing the complexity of transparency, our approach can better identify areas for improvement and lead to more effective policy interventions. We argue that traditional approaches that rely on binary or categorical variables may oversimplify the concept, resulting in inadequate policy solutions that fail to address the real challenges faced by local governments.*Daniel Aparicio-Pérez, Maria Teresa Balaguer-Coll and Emili Tortosa-Ausina acknowledge the financial support by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, PID2020-115450GB-I00).

Although nitrogen fertilizer-induced acidification has been widely documented, the coupled dynamics between base cations and exchangeable acids, particularly their quantitative relationships and thresholds across different soil pH levels, remain poorly understood. This study conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 2,348 sets of field trial data from 157 sites worldwide to reveal the acidification mechanisms under long-term nitrogen fertilization in soils with different pH levels. Quantifying the dynamic relationship between base cations (K⁺, Ca2+, Mg2+) and exchangeable acids in acidic and neutral soils through meta-analysis. This study aims to: (1) quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilizer on base cations and exchangeable acids; (2) evaluate the relationship between base cations loss and pH decline in soils with different pH values; (3) explore the mechanism by which organic matter alleviates the increase in exchangeable acids. The results showed that under nitrogen fertilization, the exchangeable K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ decreased significantly in acidic soils by 20.3%, 48.6%, and 43.3%, respectively, but showed relative lower decreases in neutral soils by 17.9%, 14.5%, and 6.3%, respectively. In addition, the exchangeable acid content in acidic soils increased significantly by 116.5%, which was much higher than that in neutral soils (35.7%). Subgroup analyses revealed that the accumulation of exchangeable acids could be effectively inhibited when the soil organic matter content exceeded 25.0 g/kg; moreover, the addition of calcium was of great significance for the retention of soil organic matter. This study emphasizes that acidic soils are more sensitive to nitrogen fertilization than neutral soils and more susceptible to soil acidification. These findings are crucial for understanding the acidification threshold of nitrogen fertilizer application, accumulative effects of fertilization time, and dynamic equilibrium between base cations and exchangeable acids in soils with different pH values. They also provide scientific evidence for quantifying the threshold of organic matter content for acidification relief and mitigating soil acidification caused by nitrogen fertilization."}}

However, there are many influencing factors in the analysis process and it is not easy to be controlled, so it is of great significance to study the process factors and propose the optimization of analysis parameters. Results Here, we propose to optimize the conditions of activated carbon enrichment-FAAS based on entropy weight(EW) theory and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) integrated model: Initially, single factor experiments were carried out on the conditions such as activated carbon consumption, ash content, adsorption column layers and washing solution temperature in the analysis process, to determine the most suitable condition range; Subsequently, the mixed orthogonal of four factors and four levels was established with the absolute value of the relative error(RE) of the determination results of three different contents of 51.8 µg g-1, 18.3µg g-1 and 1.1 µg g-1 as the experimental index; Thereafter, the EW algorithm was used to standardize the experimental data, and the weights of each index were determined to be 0.3120, 0.3219 and 0.3661, respectively; Once more, the TOPSIS model was used to construct the weighted specification matrix and determine the positive and negative ideal solutions, calculate the Euclidean distance and determine the relative closeness coefficient of each index, respectively; Ultimately, the optimal condition parameters were obtained by range analysis of the significant effects of activated carbon dosage, ash content, adsorption column layers and washing solution temperature. The findings demonstrated that the RE and relative standard deviations (RSD) of the method were 0.11%-4.69% and 0.43%-8.35%, respectively, under the optimized parameters for the preparation of 8 parallel samples and calculation of the performance indexes for the gold ore standards GBW(E)070012a, GBW07808b, GBW07809a and GBW07810, which were in accordance with the Geology and Minerals Industry Standard of the People&apos;s Republic of China (DZ/T 0130.3-2006). Significance and Novelty It indicated that the optimized analysis conditions by FAAS based on EW-TOPSIS integrated model was scientific and reliable, which fulfilled the analysis requirements of gold in rocks and minerals samples, and could be widely used in the production tasks of geological laboratories."}}

The strongest spending adjustments are observed among domestic consumers living near the border and foreign consumers from neighboring countries. Furthermore, foreign consumers from neighboring countries exhibit high exchange rate sensitivity on both the extensive and intensive margins and shift their consumption from higher- to lower-value goods and services. These findings suggest significant substitution effects in consumption on impact and emphasize the important role of cross-border shopping in small open economies. The paper provides insights for policymakers and central bankers, especially in small open economies where the exchange rate channel is an important channel of monetary policy transmission.\n</div>"}}

In particular, kernel density estimators (KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs. To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package \\texttt{PyBNesian} for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and conducted extensive experimental analyses.  Our results demonstrate that the proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data. In particular, unbiased cross validation generally outperforms the normal rule, highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios"}}

As an institution and instrument of authority grounded in scientific expertise, the IPCC has come to play a critical role in advancing political, cultural, and economic awareness of the character of climate change. The IPCC has been the subject of a great deal of research, none of which has focused directly on the manner in which its authoritative status rests both formally and informally on multiple layers of shared knowledge, information, and data.

Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically.Results: Participants viewed the app positively, noting improvements in care delivery, communication, and patient engagement. Its user-friendly interface supported integration into routine workflows. However, barriers included unreliable power and internet access, digital challenges among older users, and unclear roles for junior staff. Suggestions included improved supervision, role clarity, targeted training, and decision-support features for junior staff.Innovation: The study adopted a user-centered, context-sensitive approach focused on real-world provider experiences. It illustrates how mHealth tools developed elsewhere can be adapted to low-resource settings. Proposed innovations include digital literacy training, role-specific decision support, and blended care models. These frame innovation as both technological adaptation and strategic system design.Conclusions: Healthcare workers found the mHealth app feasible and acceptable.

Stacking convolutional layers to access multi-hop messages and mixing messages from nodes in different classes easily cause over-smoothing. Additionally, without leveraging abundant unlabelled nodes intentionally, GCN trained by limited labelled nodes is prone to overfitting. We overcome these limitations by creating resonance in message propagation between node pairs in the same class. The new mechanism yields better node representations because it expands message access and enhances useful messages. The farther resonance propagates, the more unlabelled nodes participate in training. Moreover, a regularisation item is adopted to avoid incorrect and excessive resonance. The effectiveness of message resonance is theoretically proven and verified in SSNC experiments."}}

The caregiving relationship is a complex, dyadic process that can profoundly affect both the caregiver and the care recipient, underscoring the need to alleviate caregiver burden and support their well-being. Understanding the motivations behind why individuals take on caregiving roles is essential, as it can predict their experiences, perceptions, and the overall impact of caregiving on their lives. A systematic review by Greenwood and Smith identified key motivators for informal caregivers. Additionally, substantial evidence shows that cultural perspectives and social values significantly influence caregiver experiences and motivations. Methods: This systematic review aimed to update the findings of Greenwood and Smith by examining recent research on the motivations behind caregiving across different demographics, ethnicities, and cultures. Six electronic databases were searched from August 2018 to January 2024. Titles and abstracts were screened using machine learning methods (ASReview), and a subset of full texts underwent duplicate screening. Eligible studies were appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and data were extracted and organised into thematic categories. Results: The initial search yielded 1,843 articles, of which 37 studies met the inclusion criteria after deduplication and screening. Cultural explanations for caregiving motivations included familism, ethnic identity, cultural values and beliefs, a sense of obligation, and personal fulfilment. Discussion: Cultural perceptions and social values significantly shape caregivers' experiences and perceptions, influencing families' engagement with and acceptance of formal care and support services. These findings highlight the need for further research to guide the development of culturally sensitive psychosocial support interventions tailored for diverse caregiving populations. Such personalised approaches are essential for reducing caregiver burden and fostering an inclusive caregiving environment that respects caregivers' unique motivations and values from various cultural backgrounds."}}

This paper introduces an integrated, stochastic simulation-optimization framework that jointly optimizes replenishment quantities, dynamic shelf-life decisions, and disruption recovery via adaptive pricing. First, a mixed-integer linear program capturing quality-adjusted pricing, holding and disposal costs, and penalty terms for unmet demand are formulated. Then it is embedded in a simulation-based genetic algorithm to handle lead-time variability and random demand. Shelf life is treated as a decision variable, allowing the genetic algorithms to determine optimal discard ages, while disruptions trigger a repricing mechanism parameterized by price‐adjustment factor, recovery rate, and demand elasticity. Computational experiments demonstrate that dynamic shelf-life control cuts waste-related losses by up to 95%, and adaptive repricing restores 85–90% of pre-shock revenue within five days. Sensitivity analyses identify moderate repricing and recovery parameters as the best trade-off between revenue stabilization and demand volatility. This unified approach offers a practical decision-support tool for resilient, cost-effective perishable food supply chain management."}}

The ADP approach introduces a smart cutoff criterion and brute-force initialization to significantly reduce computational overhead while preserving the global optimality of standard Dynamic Programming (DP).The proposed method is benchmarked against standard DP, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA) in a residential test case based on a German dwelling with time-varying electricity prices. Results show that ADP finds the same cost-optimal control trajectories as DP but with up to 75% less computational time. Compared to metaheuristics, ADP delivers superior cost savings while being up to two orders of magnitude faster, particularly for extended forecast horizons, enabling effective real-time MPC applications. The method is not limited to HVAC applications, but can be used for any MPC problem solvable by DP, enabling more intelligent and resource-efficient energy management under dynamic operating conditions."}}

Moreover, practical engineering requirements add further complexity to the problem, prompting additional assumptions and various extensions. Recognizing the most attractable extensions plays a pivotal role in helping scholars identify significant real-world challenges. In this survey, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses (PRISMA) model is adopted for a systematic literature review of RCPSP variants. The main purpose of this study is to provide researchers with a taxonomy and an overview of the frequent extensions of the RCPSP, as well as to identify potential research directions in project scheduling. Employing this approach, we investigate 295 articles selected among thousands published journal articles between 2010 and 2024, and identify three main categories of most frequent RCPSP extensions: multi-skilled RCPSP, RCPSPs under uncertainty, and the multi-project RCPSP. For each category, statistical analyses and summaries of model types and assumptions, solution approaches are presented. Finally, our investigation of the contributions of the reviewed studies yields insights into future research directions."}}

This paper presents a multi-objective optimization framework integrated with an ontology-based digital twin for building operation optimization. Using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, the framework balances thermal discomfort, CO2 levels, and energy costs, employing semantic models to define building topology and component constraints. Applied to a hospital case study, the approach reduced thermal discomfort by 92% and energy costs by 48% using a comfort-focused strategy with 73 decision variables selected from a Pareto front. Robustness was validated across unseen operational periods, adapting to occupancy and weather variations. Sensitivity analysis identified space temperature setpoints as primary optimization drivers, followed by supplied air temperature. This scalable framework supports building management system recommissioning by mapping results to controllers, suitable for diverse non-residential buildings."}}

For each public firm, we infer investors’ geographic distribution from the EDGAR Log File data, which tracks information acquisition activities on the SEC website. We then measure the firm’s ESG performance using MSCI KLD social ratings. We find that a larger proportion of both local institutional and retail investors is positively associated with ESG performance. Further analyses reveal that local retail investors play an important role in enhancing ESG performance for firms with low information asymmetry and strong corporate governance, while local institutional investors are more positively associated with improved ESG performance among firms with high information asymmetry and weak corporate governance. These results suggest that the effects of different types of local investors on ESG performance depend on specific information environments of firms and the strength of corporate governance. Our results further indicate that local institutional and retail investors have heterogeneous impacts on specific ESG components. Finally, we find that local investors play a significant role in strengthening firms’ ESG strengths and mitigating ESG concerns."}}
