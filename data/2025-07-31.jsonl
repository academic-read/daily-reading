It is also being used more and more for planning tourist trips. Since artificial intelligence is still under development, research has been conducted to determine which available artificial intelligence is the most reliable for planning individual travel. To conduct this research, a case study was undertaken, focusing on planning a personalized trip to New York City from Belgrade. A comprehensive analysis of various AI-driven travel planners was conducted, considering both standalone AI applications and web-based platforms. These tools were assessed based on several key criteria: Planner Design: The user-friendliness, intuitiveness, and overall design of the interface; Chat Communication: The ability to interact with the AI through natural language processing, enabling real-time queries and personalized recommendations; Pre-Trip Itinerary Planning: The AI’s capacity to generate detailed itineraries, including suggested activities, attractions, and transportation options; Enriched Travel Experiences: The integration of multimedia content, such as videos and photos, to enhance the overall travel experience; Location Information and Time Estimates: The provision of comprehensive information about destinations, including descriptions, opening hours, and estimated visit durations; Transfer and Transportation Planning: The AI’s ability to suggest optimal transportation modes and routes between different locations; Meal Planning: Recommendations for dining options, including local cuisine, budget-friendly choices, and dietary preferences; Cost Planning: Estimated budgets for accommodation, transportation, food, and activities, helping travelers plan their expenses effectively; Language Support: The availability of AI in Serbian and other languages to cater to a diverse user base. By comparing the performance of these AI-powered travel planners, the study aims to identify the most reliable and user-friendly tools for individual travelers. While leading AI systems demonstrate high reliability in generating detailed itineraries and timetables, there are still areas for improvement, particularly in terms of accurate cost estimations. Inconsistent pricing information can lead to user distrust and the need for additional verification. This research contributes to a better understanding of the current state of AI-powered travel planning tools and provides insights for future developmenst and refinement of these technologies.\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>"}}

The growth of halal tourism in Bangladesh is hindered by a lack of study on consumer perceptions, influencing factors, opportunities, and the inclusion of informal migrants, necessitating extensive scholarly investigation. Using qualitative methods, including interviews and focus groups, this study addresses these gaps and finds key insights into market demand and opportunities. Despite safety concerns and negative perceptions being the main obstacles, the sector shows promise, especially among youth who perceive halal tourism as secure and culturally resonant. Challenges include integrating cultural standards and ensuring effective certification methods. With Bangladesh's growing Muslim population, there are major growth prospects for halal tourism. However, addressing safety and cultural nuances is important for successful positioning."}}

This study introduces a <i>re-humanizing</i> approach to AI-assisted decision-making by framing algorithmic collaboration through the lens of structural embeddedness, where AI is not simply a tool for optimization, but a socially situated actor in decision ecosystems. We propose <i>Empathic Algorithm Collaboration</i> (EAC) as a mechanism to restore individualized, ethically grounded consideration in human-AI decision environments. Drawing on theories of social empathy and person-situation interactionism, EAC consists of two key components – Interpersonal Perspective-Taking (IPT) and Contextual Understanding (CU) – which guide human evaluators to engage more reflectively with AI recommendations. Through a field experiment in a micro-lending context, we examine the impact of EAC on deliberative intensity and decision quality. Results show that EAC not only fosters more conscientious deliberation but also improves decision accuracy. Furthermore, differences in evaluator responses across borrower conditions suggest that person-situation interactionism plays a critical role in shaping the cognitive and ethical engagement of decision-makers. These findings highlight the potential of EAC to support human-centered, context-sensitive decision augmentation and contribute to a broader understanding of how AI can be aligned with social values in structurally embedded domains of socially consequential decision-making.<a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>"}}

Industrial metaverses represent the next evolution of cyber-physical systems (CPS), integrating physical assets with their digital twins (DTs) for enhanced monitoring, simulation, and control. However, ensuring the integrity and security of critical digital assets within these environments remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a private BC architecture based on Hyperledger Fabric, specifically designed to authenticate and manage digital assets in real time.The proposed framework features three layers: (1) a private BC network for secure transaction handling, (2) an API bridging layer enabling cross-platform integration, and (3) a Unity-based industrial metaverse application for user interaction. Through smart contracts (Chaincode), the framework manages digital asset creation, modification, deletion, and authentication, ensuring tamper-proof records and robust traceability. Performance evaluation using Hyperledger Caliper demonstrates the system&apos;s high throughput (up to 2500 TPS for read operations) and low latency (<0.03s) with no upfront costs, significantly outperforming public blockchain alternatives in performance and cost.A case study involving a physical production workshop validates the framework’s feasibility. The results show that the framework can securely manage and authenticate all digital assets within an industrial metaverse. Compared to public BCs, the proposed private BC approach eliminates transaction fees and supports real-time digital asset management and authentication. This establishes private BCs as a secure and cost-effective foundation for trustworthy digital asset management and digital transformation in industrial environments."}}

One of the most powerful tools available for such an analysis is the browser&apos;s integrated developer tools (DevTools), which provide deep visibility into the client-side code execution. However, sophisticated malicious websites often employ anti-debugging techniques to detect the presence of such tools and alter their behavior to appear benign. Prior research into such polymorphic sites has focused mainly on isolated client-side detection vectors, those that operate independently within the browser without requiring any coordination from the server. In this work, we argue that collusive vectors, which involve explicit communication between the client and an attacker-controlled server, are common, highly effective, and stealthy. These collusive client-attacker techniques evade detection by minimizing observable client-side artifacts, making them particularly challenging to analyze. Furthermore, despite the growing prevalence of such tactics, the security community still lacks a comprehensive framework to counter these anti-debugging tactics effectively.In this paper, we examine the prevalence of isolated and collusive anti-debugging vectors and then develop a solution that enables stealthy analysis of websites. First, we introduce a novel class of anti-debugging techniques in which adversaries exploit debugger-related resource requests, such as those for source maps or debugging symbols, initiated by the browser to detect DevTools. This mechanism allows attackers to detect the presence of active debuggers with a minimal client-side footprint. Through a large-scale analysis of the top 100,000 websites and their subpages, we find that approximately 1 in 17 websites employing severe anti-debugging measures leverage such collusive vectors to identify and obstruct DevTools-based analysis. Second, to defend against these threats, we present StealthDev, a policy-driven debugging framework built on a modified Chromium browser. StealthDev is specifically designed to remain stealthy and resilient against isolated and collusive anti-debugging techniques, including those relying on timing side channels. Our evaluation shows that StealthDev  successfully bypasses anti-debugging defenses on over 97% of the most evasive websites, while incurring a modest performance overhead of just 5% on average page load times."}}

This paper investigates the infrastructure economics of sparse MoE architectures in cloud-native environments, with a focus on benchmarking their cost, performance, and accuracy across major platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. It presents a comparative analysis of leading MoE models including Switch Transformer, GLaM, DeepSpeed-MoE, and Mixtral-8x7B, highlighting their ability to achieve state-of-the-art results at a fraction of the resource consumption. The study also explores deployment challenges, such as load balancing, memory constraints, and software tooling, and discusses optimizations that enable scalable, cost-effective NLP systems. Through empirical benchmarks and real-world case studies, this paper illustrates how MoE architectures are reshaping the economics of large-scale NLP and paving the way for more sustainable and accessible AI development in the cloud."}}

Crowdfunding emerges as an alternative for entrepreneurs to secure funding or investors for their projects. This study explores entrepreneurs&apos; willingness to use crowdfunding, incorporating the mediating role of a business social network—previously an unexplored gap in research—and complementing the significance analysis with Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) and Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA), to identify the thresholds at which variables become necessary conditions for adopting crowdfunding as a financial alternative. Data were analyzed using SMART-PLS software and its IPMA and NCA tools. Key findings highlight that having a financial or business-oriented social network is significant, important, and necessary to support entrepreneurs in their willingness to use crowdfunding platforms. Results also reaffirm previous research on the significance of trust in crowdfunding platforms, financial education, perceived usefulness, and ease of use. Additionally, The Conclusion states that while these variables significantly influence entrepreneurs&apos; willingness to adopt crowdfunding, they differ in levels of performance, importance, and necessity."}}

However, achieving high accuracy and stability requires extensive data collection from densely distributed reference points (RPs), which can be resource-intensive. Interpolation is a common technique that helps increase the number of RPs without incurring excessive costs. Nonetheless, generating the locations for interpolated points, i.e., virtual reference points (VRPs), can be a big challenge since it might affect the positioning results. This paper proposes a novel method that uses a hybrid clustering algorithm combined with a center-connected interpolation approach (CCIPOS) to automatically and efficiently generate VRPs, adapting to irregular RP distribution. First, the method uses the two-phase clustering algorithm including the k-means algorithm and Voronoi diagram to group the RPs in the fingerprinting database (DB) with similar characteristics to the same cluster. Then, VRP locations within each cluster are estimated using a proposed center-connected algorithm. To fulfill the WiFi data at each VRP, Inverse Distance Weighting, a simple but effective interpolation method, is applied. From the experimental results based on the public datasets, it is demonstrated that the CCIPOS method effectively generates more VRPs into the original fingerprinting DB but reduces much time for finding the user’s position. To be specific, CCIPOS increases the total number of RPs in the DB by about seven times on average, increases the positioning accuracy by up to 6%, and decreases the computation time by nearly 90%. This study illustrates the feasibility of enhancing the WiFi fingerprint DB, particularly in large and complex environments."}}

Using data from Italian firms and detailed climate data, it uncovers a sizable negative effect of extreme temperatures on firm-level productivity and revenue-based marginal product of capital. Based on these estimates, the model generates aggregate productivity losses from local temperature fluctuations that are higher than previously thought, ranging from 0.60 to 6.82 percent depending on the scenario and the extent of adaptation. Notably, these losses are approximately four times greater than those estimated by averaging firm-level losses in a representative firm model, which does not capture frictions that alter allocative efficiency in a heterogeneous firm setting. Therefore, incorporating our framework into Integrated Assessment Models is likely to revise upwards the estimated economic costs of climate change."}}

However, this paper proposes a novel Dynamic Scharr-Gaussian Learning with Skeletal Topology Awareness Network (DSLSTA), which enhances the model’s ability to perceive target structures and edges through multi-stage feature interaction and adaptive filtering. First, we design a Skeleton Extraction Network to generate precise skeleton labels that represent the core topological structure of the targets. Second, we propose a Stage-Adaptive Dual-Filter Module (SADFM) that utilizes Scharr and Gaussian filters to dynamically smooth target regions based on variance estimation while preserving sharp edge details. This approach effectively suppresses background noise and improves the accuracy of the boundary. Furthermore, we construct a Cross-Stage Skeleton-Driven Interaction Module (CSSDIM) to progressively integrate skeleton information into multi-scale semantic features, allowing the network to perceive internal target structures and enhance global consistency. Extensive experiments on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSLSTA outperforms 13 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving average improvements of 4.05%, 3.32%, 11.14% and 23.81% in Sα, Eϕ, Fβ ω and M, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of skeleton guidance and adaptive filtering mechanisms  in complex camouflage scenarios. The code will be published after the article is accepted."}}

We examine the relationship between such violence and settlement characteristics in the context of the 1905 Russian Revolution, which triggered numerous anti-Jewish pogroms. Counter to an extensive literature that emphasizes the contribution to conflict of ethno-religious polarization, we show that the sharp increase in pogroms after October 1905, when publication of the October Manifesto and accompanying anti-Semitic propaganda increased feelings of political threat among many non-Jews, was smaller in settlements with relatively large Jewish populations. We demonstrate that this empirical pattern can be rationalized with an elaborated version of the Esteban-Ray (2008) model of diversity and conflict when, as with the October Manifesto, political reform systematically alters the distribution of benefits across groups."}}

Despite high vaccination rates in Saudi Arabia, regional variations in vaccine confidence persist. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of vaccine hesitancy among parents in Madinah using the validated Parent Attitudes About Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 322 parents in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. Vaccine hesitancy was assessed using the Arabic version of the PACV (score ≥50 indicating hesitancy). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated model discrimination (AUC = 0.561, 95% CI). Logistic regression identified predictors of hesitancy while adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Results: The study revealed a high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy (73.9%, 238/322 parents). Significant occupational disparities were observed: healthcare workers exhibited markedly lower hesitancy (15.5%, 11/71) compared to non-healthcare parents (70.9%, 178/251; χ² = 5.302, p = 0.021).

No significant associations were found between hesitancy and age, gender, education level, marital status, or income (p &gt; 0.05 for all). The model demonstrated good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ² = 7.816, p = 0.045) but moderate discrimination (AUC = 0.561), suggesting additional unmeasured factors influence hesitancy. Conclusion: Vaccine hesitancy is highly prevalent among parents in Madinah, with healthcare workers demonstrating significantly greater vaccine confidence. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions that focus on non-healthcare parents while leveraging healthcare professionals as trusted advocates. Future research should explore specific reasons for hesitancy to inform culturally tailored public health strategies in this region."}}

They also show that the videos posted on that platform provide a strong response to fake news, either as a preventive measure or in response to existing publications. Discussion: In the current landscape of declining mass media, where audience dispersion leads a to (sometimes deliberate) fragmentation of discourse, we are confronted with the paradox of being a society with access to a vast amount of information, but not well-informed.

Calibrated to U.S. data from the 1980s and 2010s, the model replicates the rise in both earnings and firm size inequality and matches several untargeted distributional features. Counterfactual decompositions reveal that changes in firm structure - not widening productivity gaps - account for most of the observed increase in employment concentration. These findings complement emerging evidence that concentration is increasingly shaped by differential scalability and organizational structure, rather than divergence in firm-level fundamentals."}}

Key modifications to MOEA/D include adaptive weight vector adjustment, Differential Evolution (DE) operators for enhanced exploration, gradient-based local search for fine policy refinement, and dynamic environment adaptation to respond to evolving city dynamics. Extensive simulations in a realistic smart city environment demonstrate superior convergence speed, robustness under uncertainty, and improved Pareto front quality compared to baseline methods such as GA-PPO and PSO-SAC. The results confirm the framework’s capability to generate diverse, high-quality policies that empower decision-makers to effectively navigate conflicting objectives.

These factors have become all the more important in light of the recent banking crisis in the United States. The lessons learnt from the recent banking crisis have heightened the need for financial regulators and bank supervisors to undertake continuous search for the non-traditional determinants of financial stability to identify risks early and mitigate risks to financial system stability. In this article, we examine some non-traditional determinants of financial stability using data from sixty-one countries from 2009 to 2021. The first-difference panel GMM regression method was used to estimate the model, and we find that greater financial stability in the previous period is followed by greater financial stability in the subsequent period in all regions, signalling the persistence of financial stability. The loan-to-deposit ratio improves financial stability in European and Americas countries while countries that have a high level of financial inclusion, and whose banking sector have a high loan-to-deposit ratio, are more financially stable. Financial inclusion improves financial stability in high inflation environments particularly in African and Americas countries. High levels of financial inclusion impair financial stability during a recession particularly in Asian countries. African banks with a high loan-to-deposit ratio are more financially stable during a recession. Also, Americas and African countries that have a combined high financial inclusion and inflation rates and whose banking sector have a high loan-to-deposit ratio are less financially stable, indicating that high inflation hinders financial inclusion and loan-to-deposit ratio from improving financial stability."}}

While clinical trial transparency aims to address this issue, increased public scrutiny may make managers more risk-averse, potentially stifling novel R&amp;D initiatives. This raises the question: Does transparency hinder technologically novel R&amp;D?&nbsp; <br><br>Methodology/Results: Using data from nearly 10,000 clinical trials from 2000 to 2014, we examine how a 2005 policy to increase transparency affects drug novelty. Using a continuous difference-in-differences approach, we find that transparency prompts firms to rely more on previously-used technologies (i.e., exploitative R&amp;D) without reducing their pursuit of never-before-tested technologies (i.e., exploratory R&amp;D). We identify negative informational spillovers as a mechanism: technology failures that are now more visible because of transparency could erode confidence in related trials, prompting firms towards familiar technologies to avoid reputational damage. Consistent with this mechanism, the impact of transparency is strongest among firms with less-diversified portfolios that are the most exposed to negative informational spillovers.&nbsp;<br><br>Managerial implications: Our primary theoretical contribution is in demonstrating the unintended negative impact of transparency on novelty. For managers, we highlight diversification as a mitigation strategy. We urge policymakers to create incentives to support novel R&amp;D despite transparency pressures."}}

However, the final decision-making authority for forest management lies with the landowner, and policies promoting resource management must also consider the characteristics of forest conditions under each ownership type. In this study, we used National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to determine the current structures of Japanese cedar plantations in terms of productivity and biodiversity, as well as differences among ownership types. The stand structure indices for productivity and biodiversity were calculated; cluster analysis identified four distinct forest stand types: high-mixed, low-mixed, managed, and dense plantation forests (PF). Notable relationships emerged between ownership and stand types. Forest stratification, the number of standing dead trees, and number of nonplanted trees differed significantly among the stand types. Furthermore, national forests had considerably more high-mixed PF (characterized by high species diversity and a mix of planted and nonplanted trees), indicating the efforts of successful diversification. Community forests exhibited more well-managed PFs, signifying effective management resulting from communal efforts and economies of scale. Individually owned forests were predominantly dense PFs, often reflecting under-managed conditions with high tree density, potentially owing to factors such as aging owners and low timber prices. On-site environmental factors could have less influence on stand structure than long-term forest management practices. Stand structure evaluation using NFI data could help monitor and evaluate progress in achieving the policy goal of converting monospecific PF into more diversified planted forests."}}

Delivery companies and merchants can introduce some innovative solutions such as the equipment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to decrease their operating costs, environmental impact, and social risks during the delivery process. This paper mainly develops a mathematical model to get the best allocation of AVs among city logistics centers (CLCs) as a mixed delivery method. The advantage of the presented model stems from considering the equipment cost, the delivery cost, and the CO2 emission, which is measured through social carbon cost (SCC). In addition, this paper establishes a risk model considering the impact of seasonal variations to evaluate the infection risk of delivery during pandemic periods for four potential delivery scenarios: customers going to CLCs, ordering online and picking-up at CLCs, delivering by traditional vehicles (TVs), and delivering by the mixed method with the optimal allocation of AVs. The research finds the optimal allocation for a London case, reveals the relationship between the nominal service capacity (NCpa) of CLCs and the optimal number of CLCs equipped with AVs, concludes that the more CLCs are equipped with AVs, the fewer CO2 emissions and the fewer citizens will be infected, and provides some managerial insights that may help delivery companies and merchants make appropriate decisions about the allocation of AVs."}}

As automation technologies gain traction, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) assist human pickers by handling transport tasks and optimizing workflows. However, due to high cost levels and infrastructural constraints, AGVs are often introduced incrementally, resulting in mixed-technology scenarios where workers with a prior technology generation and workers with the new (AGV) technology generation operate side by side, for example in the same warehouse aisle. One challenge in such settings is picker blocking, which occurs when the actions of one picker impede or delay the movements of another picker. This study empirically examines pick column blocking and within-aisle blocking regarding their impact on task performance time. Using a mixed-effects regression model, we analyze 490,398 pick events from a German retailer during 2023. Our results show that both types of blocking significantly increase task performance time. However, AGV assistance mitigates these negative effects. Our results demonstrate that AGVs go beyond transport assistance by reducing congestion and ensuring smoother, more efficient movement. The study provides valuable insights into the theory and management to optimize warehouse operations and contributes to the growing research on human-AGV collaboration in logistics."}}

However, many existing models tend to be highly complex, making them difficult for industrial managers to adopt practically. This article introduces a decision-support model that reprograms already scheduled maintenance activities, based on predefined plans, to lower the number and duration of planned downtimes. The approach uses integer linear programming and incorporates key operational parameters such as resource availability, task duration, and maintenance frequency. The model employs an opportunistic grouping strategy to identify compatible tasks during scheduled shutdowns, maximizing resource use and cutting down on interruptions. To ensure real-world applicability, the model is implemented using a user-friendly software tool with an interactive interface, allowing maintenance professionals to use it without advanced technical skills. An application in an electricity distribution company showed the model’s effectiveness. Results revealed a 44.4% reduction in scheduled shutdowns and a 25.5% decrease in total downtime. Even with the addition of corrective maintenance events, the rescheduling maintained significant improvements. This work enhances the literature by introducing a post-planning rescheduling stage that optimizes existing maintenance plans through intelligent grouping, respecting constraints, and increasing management flexibility.

We examine how these challenges manifest in the initiative to develop a voluntary product stewardship scheme for bedding in Australia. The study is based on a research collaboration with the Australian Bedding Stewardship Council (ABSC), interviews and site visits with 15 of its member organisations, followed by an interactive online workshop called ‘Beds of the Future’. We first examine how motivations for participating in the ABSC’s product stewardship initiative differ among the different types of organisations in the bedding supply chain, from manufacturers to retailers to waste managers and materials recyclers. Informed by scholarship on business ecosystems, diverse economies and sustainability transitions, we pose questions about the trajectories of change that supply chain actors are currently engaged with and the valuing practices that support them. We then examine the potential for synergies between these trajectories to generate system-level change and the agency of key organisations required to achieve this, focusing in particular on design-led and waste management-led trajectories. The case of the bedding stewardship initiative in Australia demonstrates both strengths and limitations of the product focus for progressing circular economy concepts. It highlights the need for orchestration by both manufacturers and government agencies to coordinate change trajectories informed by circuits of value, and the significance of diversity among organisation types and their valuing practices."}}

We argue that limited bank intermediation in these countries serves as a protective measure against the additional risks posed by natural resource rents. Credit rationing helps banks mitigate credit risks, which are particularly pronounced in resource-based economies. Furthermore, risk diversification through bank business models appears to be less effective in the presence of natural resource rents, contributing to greater financial instability in these countries."}}

By employing GD, parts are optimized for material efficiency, structural performance, longevity, and reduced waste, aligning with circular economy principles. This study conducts a quantitative comparison of cost and environmental impacts between conventional manufacturing (CM) and generatively designed additive manufacturing (GDAM) in the context of aviation industry centralized spare part inventory pooling. We estimate the total annual and lifecycle cost of each scenario using a developed cost model integrating the inventory models. Our sensitivity analysis reveals that on an equal part longevity, GDAM becomes cost-competitive beyond ~84% part weight reduction. While GDAM part being 53% lighter than CM part, a 50% increase in the part longevity yields cost savings of up to 24.6%, demonstrating that durability is a more influential driver than lightweighting in aerospace industry. Furthermore, GDAM offers substantial sustainability advantages, including significant reductions in fuel consumption cost, material waste, and CO2 emissions. These environmental benefits become increasingly evident under high weight-reduction scenarios. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating GDAM into spare part supply chain (SPSC) cost analysis. We clarify under which conditions GDAM inventory pooling requires centralized stocking to avoid excessive aircraft on the ground (AOG) costs. We also provide practical insights into when GDAM production capacity pooling is viable, particularly for non-critical parts. The findings inform strategic decisions for supply chain managers and policymakers by quantifying the economic and environmental trade-offs of adopting GDAM-based inventory pooling in aviation."}}

Using a sample of 1,275 Eurozone corporate bonds issued between 2015:Q1 and 2018:Q4, we estimate a two-stage empirical model to evaluate. In the first stage, we find that the initial association between CSPP eligibility and lower spreads disappears once firm- and bond-level characteristics are controlled for, suggesting that observed differences reflect issuer and instrument features rather than programme eligibility. While the CSPP’s effect does not vary systematically by firm or bond characteristics, the results indicate broader market effects, likely driven by the programme’s signaling power and perceived credibility, which extended beyond the impact of direct bond purchases. In the second stage, we assess changes in leverage following the issuance of bonds. CSPP eligibility did not seem to affect the debt ratio in the issuance year. However, longer-maturity eligible bonds are associated with delayed increases in leverage, as firms expanded their debt ratios in the year following issuance. This pattern suggests that improved financing conditions under the programme may have encouraged firms to raise additional debt at a later stage."}}

These differences categorize them into distinct subsectors with unique risk profiles. This study applies the novel methodology proposed by Engle and Campos-Martins (2023) to analyse the common volatility (COVOL) across cryptocurrency subsectors, including Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Smart Contract platforms. Using a sample of the largest 17 cryptocurrencies from March 2016 to April 2024, our findings reveal distinct volatility patterns within these subsectors, driven by macroeconomic factors such as the term spread and interest rates.

Building on a panel of annual ratings from Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch for over 104 countries between 1996 and 2022, we augment a macro‑fiscal model with contemporaneous and time‑averaged measures of bank efficiency, profitability, capitalization and liquidity. Adopting a fully Bayesian framework with a LASSO shrinkage prior, we estimate a linear panel model via three sampling algorithms: the Bayesian Gibbs Slice Sampler (BGSS), its QR decomposition (QR‑BGSS), and the No‑U‑Turn Sampler (NUTS). Our findings reveal that sustained improvements in bank efficiency and robust capital buffers significantly elevate sovereign ratings over the long term, while short‑run banking shocks receive comparatively little weight. We also document some heterogeneity across agencies. Profitability’s unexpected long‑run negative association with ratings suggests that persistently high returns may mask risk‑taking behaviours detrimental to sovereign creditworthiness. Finally, and from a methodological viewpoint, we find that BGSS and QR‑BGSS deliver virtually identical posterior inferences to NUTS at a fraction of the computational cost, highlighting their potential for scalable, real‑time credit‐risk applications"}}

Despite great efforts, massive segments of the Indian population, particularly in rural and village areas, remain unaware of the importance of environmental protection. This lack of information has led to exploitation of natural resources, unsustainable practices, and environmental degradation. This paper highlights the critical position of people's participation in promoting ecological awareness and sustainable practices across India, with particular awareness of rural areas where the connection between communities and nature is deeply intertwined.&nbsp; <br><br>India's rural population, which constitutes nearly 65% of the total, is closely dependent on natural sources of livelihood. However, Ignorance of sustainability has resulted in indiscriminate extraction of groundwater, deforestation, and poor waste control. According to the National Green Tribunal, more than 70% of the rural water in our bodies is polluted due to inadequate waste management, while deforestation continues to push upwards. These issues highlight the urgent need for tailored environmental education in rural areas.&nbsp;<br><br>This paper examines the success of local fads such as Village Forest Committees under the Joint Forest Management Program, which expanded forest cover by 30%, and national campaigns, along with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and Jal Shakti Abhiyan, which mobilized one thousands upon thousands for sustainable practices. Programs like the National Green Corps, bringing together more than 200,000 schools, show the potential of teaching a younger era about conservation.<br><br>Persistent barriers, including socio-financial inequality, illiteracy, and limited access to records, impede progress. Integrating environmental education into higher education curricula, involving panchayats and self-service corporations, and leveraging digital systems are critical to empowering rural groups.&nbsp;<br><br>This observation implies that well-informed citizens, supported through local initiatives and authority rules, are essential for sustainable development. Empowering rural India with know-how and tools can reduce the beneficial use of resources and achieve long-term ecological stability.&nbsp;"}}

We investigate the drivers of heterogeneity in these expectations, including sector, CEO age, geographical location, and labor market tightness. Our findings reveal that firms with older CEOs, located in regions with tight labor markets, were more likely to expect inflation to be persistent post-pandemic. Furthermore, firms expecting transitory inflation significantly reduced short-term borrowing and inventory, while firms with persistent inflation expectations increase capital expenditures.

In the United States, the impact of bioenergy technology on carbon intensity initially shows a positive effect, which later turns negative as per capita capital stock increases. The technology's inhibitory effect strengthens with higher levels of education but becomes insignificant as the Gini coefficient rises. In China, increasing per capita capital stock shifts the impact of bioenergy technology from negative to insignificant, while higher education levels enhance its inhibitory effect. The Gini coefficient, however, does not significantly affect the technology's impact. Additionally, these threshold effects exhibit notable regional variations.

Using a synthetic control approach we find that the reform lowered housing cost growth in the five years following implementation: home prices were 16% to 34% lower, while rents were 17.5% to 34% lower relative to a counterfactual Minneapolis constructed from similar metro areas. Placebo tests document these housing cost trajectories were the lowest of 83 donor cities (p=0.012). The results remain consistent and robust to a series of subset analyses and controls. We explore the possible mechanism of these impacts and find that the reform did not trigger a construction boom or an immediate increase in the housing supply. Instead, the observed price reductions appear to stem from a softening of housing demand, likely driven by altered expectations about the housing market."}}

The study analyzes how population aging affects the monetary policy environment and explores appropriate policy responses. As of the end of 2024, Korea has become a “super-aged” society with over 20% of the population aged 65 or older, and it is projected to have the highest elderly population share among OECD countries by 2045.<br><br>II. Aging is found to induce structural shifts in the monetary policy environment—namely, slower growth, lower real interest rates, and weaker soundness of financial institutions—which can narrow monetary policy space and exacerbate trade-offs between policy objectives when the foundations of growth and financial stability weaken simultaneously. The sectoral breakdown of these structural shifts is as follows:<br><br>• Slower growth and lower real rates: An open-economy life-cycle model for Korea shows that aging reduces labor supply, thereby lowering potential growth, and through reduced investment and increased savings, exerts downward pressure on equilibrium real interest rates. For example, if fertility and life expectancy had remained at 1991 levels (1.71 births per woman; life expectancy 72.2 years), the equilibrium real rate in 2024 would have been approximately 1.4 percentage points higher. Scenario analyses incorporating future demographic projections likewise indicate persistent downward pressure on both growth and real rates.<br><br>• Modest disinflationary pressure: Panel data analyses across OECD countries, combined with simulations for Korea, suggest that aging is projected to exert downward pressure on inflation of about a 0.15 percentage point per year from 2025 to 2070. However, offsetting upward pressures—such as deglobalization, supply-chain restructuring, and climate change—imply significant uncertainty about the long-term inflation trajectory.<br><br>• Weakened financial stability foundations: An analysis of panel data covering 7,148 banks over 27 years in OECD countries shows that aging tends to reduce banks’ capital ratios and increase default risk, driven by declining profits and subsequent pursuit of higher-risk, higher-return activities. Institutions with lending structures heavily concentrated in real estate exhibit larger negative impacts.<br><br>III. Structural shifts due to aging should be addressed through structural reforms in the real and financial sectors rather than short-term measures. Should the low growth trend persist, calls for accommodative monetary policy may intensify. However, low growth driven by structural factors cannot be effectively addressed by short-term, demand-side policies and such measures may entail side effects including financial imbalances. Therefore, a sustainable solution should be sought through structural reforms aimed at strengthening the fundamentals of the real and financial sectors.<br><br>IV. Specifically, structural reforms in the real and financial sectors should proceed as follows: To offset the decline in labor supply caused by aging, policies should expand female labor force participation and support continued employment among older workers. At the same time, improving youth employment, housing, and childcare conditions is necessary to encourage fertility recovery. To boost total factor productivity, policymakers should promote technological innovation and enhance the efficiency of resource allocation across the economy. Given that real estate–focused lenders are more vulnerable to aging effects, the current reliance on lending-based real estate financing needs to be gradually reduced. Additionally, in light of the financial market’s sensitivity to external price variables, the base of the demand for the Korean won must be broadened, and foreign exchange markets should be deepened to enhance stability and resilience.<br><br>V. These structural reforms are expected to raise real interest rates and potential growth, thereby expanding monetary policy space and reinforcing the foundations of financial stability. Scenario analyses indicate that, if three structural reforms are implemented—a gradual recovery in fertility to the OECD average, expanded employment among older cohorts, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in TFP growth—both real interest rates and potential growth will be approximately 1 percentage point higher on average during 2025–2070, compared to a no- reform baseline. Higher real rates would widen policy space and alleviate structural constraints on monetary policy; stronger growth would bolster borrowers’ profitability and soundness, strengthening the foundation of financial stability.<br><br>VI. In addition, efforts to enhance monetary policy effectiveness under the changed conditions should be pursued. These include continued refinement of the environment for open market operations to better reflect aging-induced changes in the policy environment; improved policy communication to more effectively manage market expectations; the use of an integrated policy framework that combines multiple instruments to achieve policy objectives; and, in particular, stronger coordination between monetary policy and macroprudential measures to improve overall policy effectiveness."}}

The results indicate that: (1) under extreme short-term rainfall, a 50 cm intermediate soil layer significantly delays infiltration, reducing interface moisture content by approximately 40% and effectively minimizing leachate generation; (2) although increasing the cover thickness to 70–100 cm further delays infiltration, the marginal benefits decline; (3) a stratified structure consisting of 5 m coal gangue alternated with 0.5 m soil layers, topped by a 1 m surface layer, facilitates smooth moisture transitions and reduces deep percolation under prolonged rainfall; (4) even under extreme rainfall conditions (50 cm/day), the system maintains hydrological stability; and (5) multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II suggests that a total soil cover thickness of 50–60 cm achieves a favorable balance between leachate control, economic cost, and ecological risk in both arid and humid regions."}}

The compliance ensures the creation of legal certainty and justice. This study used a normative legal method through a literature review combined with a case study method focusing on the State Administrative Court (“PTUN”) in Mataram, Indonesia. The following study problems were addressed, namely (1) How effective is the implementation of the PTUN decisions in Indonesia in this case? and (2) What factors influence the ineffectiveness of the Court’s decisions implementation?. The results showed that the implementation of the State Administrative Court’s decisions was ineffective due to the absence of a dedicated executive enforcement institution, weak sanctions against disobedient officials, and a bureaucratic culture permissive of legal violations. The three factors emphasized that the weaknesses in Indonesian administrative law originated from the substance of the law as well as the institutional structure and the legal culture of a bureaucracy that did not comply with court decisions."}}

Despite its global pilgrimage appeal, the urban environment of Vrindavan is under severe stress due to unmanaged religious tourism, unregulated commercial expansion, and fragmented civic infrastructure. Core precincts like the Banke Bihari Temple zone, Loi Market, Yamuna Ghats, and the 21-kilometer Parikrama Marg experience extreme congestion, sanitation challenges, and environmental degradation, especially during peak festivals. The absence of a coordinated urban planning mechanism has resulted in piecemeal interventions, compromising both spiritual sanctity and urban functionality. This study proposes a Comprehensive Pilgrimage Corridor that integrates sacred geography, pedestrian connectivity, heritage preservation, and ecological restoration within a unified governance framework. Anchored around the Banke Bihari precinct and extending to Nidhivan, Keshi Ghat, Rangji Temple, and other religious-spiritual landmarks, the project seeks to transform Vrindavan into a model of sustainable pilgrimage urbanism. Key features include the creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for coordinated implementation, rehabilitation zones for affected vendors and residents, smart mobility interventions, and financial models combining state, central, and private funding mechanisms. Drawing on successful case studies like the Kashi Vishwanath and Mahakal corridors, this initiative presents Vrindavan as a replicable model of spiritual urban renewal. It emphasizes inclusive stakeholder participation, heritage-sensitive design, and long-term ecological and economic sustainability. The proposal reimagines the sacred landscape not only as a devotional terrain but as an evolving urban form where spiritual experience, environmental responsibility, and community well-being coexist harmoniously."}}

Thermodynamic and kinetic investigation of the charge transfer studies revealed that the In2O3@ZIS Z-scheme heterostructure significantly enhanced the photoelectrode&apos;s photo-generated electron-hole separation efficiency and light-harvesting capability.

The sensor demonstrated a linear response ranging from 10-7 M to 10-2 M with a low detection limit (LOD) of 29.9 nM. Furthermore, an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was employed to train 152 experimental data and generated a predictive regression model for AA.

Our findings reveal that, across both markets, stock selection driven by machine learning methods demonstrates strong return predictability, whereas timing signals show limited efficacy, particularly when accounting for trading costs. We conclude that the marginal contribution of timing within a machine learning-based stock selection framework is relatively constrained, a pattern that is consistent across both the U.S. and Chinese markets.

Firstly, natural language processing and fine-grained sentiment analysis methods are integrated to systematically deconstruct service attributes in review texts and quantify their sentiment orientation values. Then, we design a neural network-Kano joint model, revealing the nonlinear driving effects of service attribute sentiment orientations on user satisfaction through a Backpropagation Neural Network incorporating an attention mechanism, simultaneously combining an improved Kano model for service demand classification, and ultimately generating a three-dimensional Sentiment-Driver-Kano (SD-Kano) decision matrix that integrates dual importance of service attributes (emotional expression intensity, satisfaction driving effects) and Kano types. Finally, an experiments demonstrates that this model can precisely identify the positioning and user perception characteristics of different service attributes, and proposes several targeted service attribute improvement priorities and resource allocation strategies. The research outcomes provide charging service operators with a scientifically rigorous and operationally practical decision-support tool for implementing differentiated resource allocation and service efficiency enhancement."}}

First, the SMTDNR problem is established, incorporating distributed renewable generators, fuel generators, energy storage systems, and controllable loads, simplified through circular constraint linearization, Jabr relaxation, and second-order cone (SOC) relaxation techniques. Then, a one-stage multi-timescale successive branch reduction (MTSBR) algorithm is developed for distribution networks with one redundant branch, which transforms the SMTDNR problem into an SMTOPF problem. This is extended to a two-stage MTSBR algorithm for general networks with multiple redundant branches, which iteratively runs the proposed one-stage MTSBR algorithm.

An empirical analysis was conducted through the responses of 199 people surveyed online and offline for construction industry workers. It was found that variables that affect the usefulness include connection quality, systems, and services, as well as user innovation. Smart construction technology infrastructure and users&apos; innovation and usefulness have been found to affect their intention to use, and intelligence, service quality, and user innovation suitable for field characteristics have been found to affect ease of use. Factors affecting the performance of smart construction technology were found to be both usefulness and intention to use. The results of this study confirmed a causal relationship model that explains the factors influencing the success of smart construction technology. The results suggest that smart construction technology policymakers need to establish and implement policies for the parallel development of surrounding ecosystems to lead the development of smart construction technology. Smart construction technology development and sellers need to develop incentive programs that encourage users&apos; innovation. It was confirmed that the expansion and development of the surrounding ecosystem were necessary for the success of smart construction technology."}}

However, the intermittency of renewable electricity and the availability of parallel revenue opportunities in both the electricity and hydrogen markets complicate the scheduling of green hydrogen production. The scheduling should maximise the total revenue from short-term sales of electricity and hydrogen against the long-term HPA delivery obligations. This challenge is addressed by developing a Bounded Fuzzy Logic Control (BFLC) which determines the daily HPA delivery target based on day-ahead forecasts of electricity and hydrogen prices, as well as wind capacity factors. Subsequently, the daily target is imposed as a constraint in dispatch optimisation which allocates energy and hydrogen flows for each hour of the day.Revenue comparisons over several years demonstrate that the BFLC achieves total annual revenues within 9\\% of optimal revenues that are based on perfect foresight. The BFLC revenues consistently exceed those of steady control, with the largest differences observed under conditions of elevated price levels and variability. The BFLC provides an effective long-term scheduling of green hydrogen production, enabling realistic revenue quantification that mitigates economic risks without overlooking economically viable projects."}}

In today’s complex global business environment, brokers play a key role in helping foreign entrepreneurs overcome the gap - liability of outsidership to access local networks. Yet, the cognitive and structural mechanisms behind brokers’ decisions remain underexplored. Drawing on a multiple-case study of Chinese entrepreneurs in France, we theorize a cognitive-structural framework centered on two dimensions: the relative attractiveness of outsiders (i.e., their perceived value in terms of resources, knowledge, and offerings), and the tolerance for outsider replaceability (i.e., brokers’ willingness to risk being bypassed after making an introduction). Our informants have played roles both as brokers and as outsiders, allowing us to capture how role-switching experiences shape their understanding of brokerage dynamics. While brokers are more likely to facilitate ties with highly attractive outsiders, their tolerance depends on the expected returns: it is ‘low’ when insiders offer more, ‘moderate’ when returns are in balance, and ‘high’ when outsiders are more valuable. This study thus advances international business research by revealing the microfoundations of brokerage as a strategic, power-sensitive process."}}

Traditional methods often face limitations in identifying and modeling the complex temporal dependencies inherent in streamflow data. Therefore, this study investigates the performance of two deep learning models— Patch Time Series Transformer (PatchTST) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) —for daily streamflow forecasting of the Sefidrud River. The LSTM model is capable of capturing sequential and long-term dependencies in time series, whereas PatchTST leverages the Transformer architecture to extract both local and global features simultaneously. To enhance forecasting accuracy, an ensemble learning approach, including Stacking and Weighted Averaging methods is proposed, aiming to exploit the complementary strengths of the two models. The number of input lags was determined using a VAR approach, with two streamflow lag terms selected as model inputs. Model performance was evaluated using both numerical metrics and graphical analyses. The results indicate that the proposed Stacking Ensemble method outperforms individual models, achieving an RMSE=1.593 m³/s, MAE=1.333 m³/s, NS=0.991, and CC= 0.998. These findings highlight the potential of the Stacking Ensemble as a robust and novel approach for hydrological forecasting, particularly for daily streamflow prediction in mountainous and semi-humid regions."}}

Using natural language processing, we analyze more than 300, 000 earnings call transcripts issued worldwide between 2004 and 2022. By identifying expressions commonly associated with collusion, our method provides competition authorities with a tool to detect potentially anticompetitive behavior in public communications. Our approach can extend beyond earnings calls to other sources, such as news articles, trade press, and industry reports. Our method informed the European Commission’s 2024 unannounced inspections in the car tire sector, prompted by concerns over price coordination through public communication."}}

Various factors influence the abnormal return of acquiring firms in M&A transactions, among which the cross-border status is particularly crucial. This study examines the effect of cross-border and domestic M&A transactions on acquirer price reactions, using a sample of 3893 M&A deals involving both public and private targets by United States listed firms, during the period 1999-2007. The results of the quantitative analysis indicate that cross-border M&A transactions generate lower stock returns for shareholders around the announcement date compared to domestic M&As. Additionally, acquirer size is negatively related to share returns, while the book-to-market ratio is positively associated with abnormal returns. Considering the public status of the target, this study finds that cross-border acquisitions of listed targets may lead to higher returns and mitigate the negative effects typically observed in cross-border M&As. With the findings, the study contributes to complementing existing literature and providing insights into M&A transactions by using comprehensive and typical M&A data. It suggests potential influencing factors for acquirers’ returns, emphasising cross-border complexity and targets’ public status. This study provides strategic insights for managers and valuable signals for individual investors, especially under today’s global market volatility. The findings bridge academic research with practical application, enriching the understanding of value creation in M&A activities, and offering a benchmark for future research on M&A."}}

Utilizing machine learning techniques—specifically Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)—the research aims to identify the optimal locations for ABC installation (Lˊ) and their discharge (Qa). The findings indicate that the XGBoost model outperforms the others in predicting the discharge of ABCs, achieving R2 = 0.926, RMSE = 0.023, and MAE = 0.019. Utilizing XGBoost, sensitivity analysis revealed that the densimetric Froude number exerts the most significant influence on Qa. Optimization results utilizing XGBoost show that when the importance weights of objectives (ω Qa and ωLˊ) are equal, the optimal location ratio (Lˊ/Average freshwater depth) is approximately 0.52; however, as these weights change, the optimized location ratio varies accordingly. This flexible, weighted optimization approach allows decision-makers to tailor ABC positioning to their specific priorities, whether focusing on cost-effectiveness or water quality, ultimately enhancing the management of freshwater resources impacted by SWI."}}

Using publicly available data from the Barrick Cortez Mine in Nevada, USA, the mining chain from blasting to semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) was modelled using Orica’s Integrated Extraction Simulator (IES). To mitigate the computational burden of full factorial simulations, three million scenarios were generated to evaluate performance sensitivity. Machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost, were trained and validated. The models achieved an accuracy of more than 90%, underscoring their reliability for predicting fragmentation outcomes. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret model predictions and quantify feature importance.

Through the system interface, users can conduct natural language requests to verify inventory information and monitor stock activities while receiving practical recommendations without requiring specialized knowledge. The backend implements FastAPI to merge with CSV or NoSQL database structures while providing scalable performance. The Streamlitbased front-end delivers a user-friendly, accessible interface that solves user interaction problems effectively. Research experiments have confirmed that this solution delivers both superb precision with fast execution times and substantially better user satisfaction than typical industry systems show. The research demonstrates how LLMs establish major supply chain operation reductions through a flexible solution that connects sophisticated information systems to end users.

With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources introducing variability and uncertainty into power grids, buildings, as significant electricity consumers, offer substantial potential for DR by dynamically adjusting their consumption. We develop a comprehensive model for building loads, incorporating economic factors through detailed dispatch cost calculations and employing a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) based metric to manage uncertainties effectively. A novel training environment is constructed using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to fit marginal distributions of critical variables and Vine Copulas to capture their complex multivariate dependencies, providing a high-fidelity simulation of market dynamics. This environment trains a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning agent to optimize quantity-price bidding decisions in continuous action spaces. The TD3 algorithm, with its twin critics and delayed policy updates, mitigates overestimation bias and ensures policy stability, outperforming traditional methods like the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Validation using ISO New England market data demonstrates that our approach significantly improves profitability and risk management for load aggregators, with the KDE-vine copula model offering superior accuracy over neural network-based alternatives and the TD3 agent achieving stable, high-reward outcomes."}}

This procedure allows us to match in an original way firm’s equipment descriptions with relevant patent documents. We then employ a difference-in-differences approach alongside a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of becoming a supplier on firms’ patents in the relevant IPC classes. Our results show that firms becoming hospital suppliers have a significantly higher propensity to innovate. About the mechanism, we show that supplying AI-powered equipment further boosts the suppliers’ innovative performance.

The existence of a private market for insurance such as contingent capital can eliminate the overinvestment incentives, leading to efficient outcomes. However, it does not eliminate fire sales. A central bank that can infuse liquidity cheaply may be motivated to intervene in the face of fire sales. If so, it can crowd out the private market and, if liquidity intervention is not priced at higher-than-breakeven rates, induce overinvestment. We examine various forms of public intervention to identify the least distortionary ones.

Next, we showed that although “multi-stakeholder focus” is now a fundamental principle, individual institutional designs incorporate systems that are compatible with maximizing shareholder value in financial capital markets, and that reforms based on soft law that prioritize capital markets have taken precedence over revisions to hard law such as the Companies Act, resulting in a system design and management that favors investors.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even today, the role of cross-shareholding in embodying the strengths of Japanese-style management remains unchanged.

Conventional hydrodynamic-based approaches are limited by their slow response time and are often computationally costly to achieve large-scale, high-resolution predictions. In this study, we present a hybrid framework that incorporates the traditional hydrodynamic models with an innovative, efficient FloodTransformer framework, enabling accurate, real-time, and high-resolution flood forecasting. We first schematise a 3Di hydrodynamic model based on the region’s geographical characteristics, rigorously validating and calibrating it against real-world observations. Using this model, hundreds of simulations representing a wide range of rainfall patterns, initial water depths, and boundary conditions are then generated and used to train the AI model. To address the computational limitations preventing the adoption of advanced AI techniques for large-scale, fine-grained rasterised spatiotemporal analysis, our FloodTransformer introduces: (1) novel size embeddings to directly encode variable-sized grid cells, and (2) tokenised time-sequence encodings that capture multi-modal temporal dependencies without significant computational overhead. This temporal tokenisation mechanism also ensures efficient sequential predictions in a single run, minimising error accumulation in iterative prediction approaches. Furthermore, our physics-informed multi-task optimisation further enhances water depth prediction accuracy through integrated regularisation. Extensive experiments on both simulated datasets and real-world historical flood events are conducted using widely adopted hydrographic evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate FloodTransformer as an innovative solution for managing flash flooding risks with both high accuracy and computational efficiency."}}

Synthesising formal epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation-whilst simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued. Deliberative democracy collapses not through censorship, but through the erosion of interpretive agency. The proposed response is not technocratic regulation, nor universal access, but the reconstruction of rational autonomy as a civic mandate-codified in education, protected by epistemic rights, and structurally embedded within open cognitive infrastructure."}}

We further investigate four different mitigation approaches against adverse weather conditions and evaluate their effectiveness. Through the comparative analysis of RD-FMEA results, we find that the introduction of an intelligent water drops algorithm can significantly reduce the risk scores, by helping UAVs’ route planning to avoid heavy rainfalls. Moreover, we show that the risk scores can be further reduced by adding rules to abort missions by predefined time threshold to avoid unsafe continuous UAV operations in adverse weather conditions."}}

In East Africa, rapid population growth and climate change impacts intensify demands for water, energy, and food (WEF), fuelling resource exploitation. Sustainable development plans aim to meet resource demands while building resilience, necessitating a multi-sectoral approach. This study employs a mixed-qualitative methodology to explore the interlinkages between nationally determined contributions, national adaptation plans and regional development in East Africa. Results show implied connections between policy instruments, sustainable development, and climate action form the crux of WEF interlinkages. WEF resource insecurity is worsened by incoherent national development plans, which create competition for shared resources and tradeoffs instead of fostering collaboration. For example, the focus on food security, mostly through extensification, has created tradeoffs with water and energy security, undermining development goals. Understanding the interconnectedness and interdependencies between sector policies, climate actions, and supranational development plans could catalyse and accelerate Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 13 and goals related to the Paris Agreement. There are implicit interlinkages and, to a certain extent, in practice. Although insufficient, these are foundations for a bottom-up approach to implementing integrated climate action commitments. The WEF nexus approach provides an opportunity to break policy and action siloes in East Africa. Ultimately, a transdisciplinary approach focused on equity, social justice, sustainability, and a just transition is required to support development agendas."}}

We find that U.S. export restrictions reduce innovation incentives among U.S. firms that export to sanctioned entities. These restrictions prompt targeted foreign firms to accelerate their own innovation efforts, ostensibly with increased support from their governments-including weakening enforcement of U.S. intellectual property rights (IPR). Weaker IPR diminishes the ability of U.S. suppliers to appropriate the returns from their R&amp;D investments, leading them to reduce R&amp;D spending by 13% and R&amp;D-related hiring by 9%. Post-sanctions, suppliers to sanctioned firms also shift their IP protection strategy: patent filings decline by 10%, while mentions of trade secrets in regulatory filings rise by 47%. These effects are stronger when sanctioned entities are likely to reverse-engineer their suppliers' technology and weaker when domestic competition necessitates U.S. firms to innovate. The impact is most pronounced in patent-intensive industries and for suppliers who hold patents in sanctioned countries. Our findings suggest that export controls may unintentionally fuel foreign innovation and IP appropriation, prompting U.S. firms to scale back innovation and favor secrecy over patenting."}}

Policymakers and scholars have focused on ensuring regulatory approval and market entry of lower-priced competitors to brand drugs, but few have analyzed a subsequent stage of competition: being accessible to consumers.&nbsp; Just because a manufacturer is permitted to sell a lower-priced product does not mean that more affordable version will be made available to patients.&nbsp;<br><br> Here, the frequently-discussed pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) play a role. PBMs create and maintain formularies, lists of drugs covered by insurance plans. Because of the leading PBMs' market power, drugs not covered on formularies tend to be inaccessible to patients.

Expanding from the ‘success criteria’ of collaboration for sustainable agriculture by Velten et al. (2021), we identified five formative dimensions – governance, leadership, facilitation, group characteristics and context – influencing the outcomes of FCs, before analysing these dimensions in more detail.ResultsWe found that the five dimensions are interdependent and dynamic, affecting the functioning of the FCs, and leading to different levels of maturity. Comparing the situation of each FC regarding the five dimensions and the level of maturity we found that the FCs started in distinct contexts with diverse initial conditions across Europe – from favourable to unfavourable. This led to different dynamic trajectories on a pathway to biodiversity sensitive farming.SignificanceThe maturity assessment matrix offers a valuable tool for FCs to reflect on their progress and capacity in achieving their goals, guiding future efforts for effective FC management."}}

The study employed a multiple case study design and was underpinned by the Social Model of Disability. A mixed methods approach was adopted employing online questionnaires, in-depth interviews to gather data from university librarians, heads of the physical development office, heads of disability units and students with visual, mobile, and hearing impairments. An observation checklist for access to the library facilities and resources was conducted, and the data were analysed thematically.  Findings revealed that most of the university libraries were not universally designed to accommodate the needs of students with disabilities which impacted negatively on information access, participation, and academic performance of these students. The study found that universal design helps to eliminate discrimination and marginalization, promotes barrier-free environments which accommodate diverse individuals in university libraries, promotes equity and inclusion of persons with disabilities in higher institutions.The study recommends the redesign of university libraries’ facilities, services, and policies to conform to universal design principles to accommodate users, especially those with disabilities, and adequate budget allocation should be made for redesigning libraries for the inclusion of SWDs."}}

Those questions and concerns, particularly on the individual level, are driven by fears about the implications of the use of generative AI. This Article identifies and explores the fears that drive these regulatory responses: fear of exposing judicial fallibility, anxiety over AI replacing human lawyers, and concerns about missing out on AI’s potential benefits. Ultimately, effective regulation of the use of generative AI in legal practice needs to be attentive to the fears and hopes surrounding generative AI in law. Only by understanding the very human anxieties regarding generative AI can the profession craft effective regulatory models that address the integration of AI in legal practice."}}

Fewer jobs are needed to keep up with the growth of the labor force, and growth rates of output and consumption will fall even if per capita output and consumption hold steady. The total US population is growing at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent, down from 1 percent in late 2023. I estimate the breakeven rate of monthly payroll growth in the jobs report needed to keep up with the labor force has fallen from 166,000 jobs in early 2024 to 86,000 jobs in June 2025. Accordingly, policymakers need to lower their targets and forecasts for key economic data and put more weight on per capita and other population-invariant measures. Adjusting expectations in light of slower population growth is essential for setting monetary policy, determining whether the United States is in recession, and other data-driven decisions and interpretations. With slower population growth, any given level of monthly payroll growth, consumption growth, or output growth reflects a stronger economy than it did a year ago. Population growth is not only slowing; it has also become more volatile and harder to estimate. It is likely that current population estimates for 2025 that statistical agencies are incorporating into economic data are too high and will be revised downward; current population estimates imply much higher immigration in 2025 than is likely under current administration policy. Economic data will need to be reinterpreted and revised in line with future adjustments to population estimates."}}

Accelerator programs play an important role in supporting startups' scaling ambitions by offering in-depth entrepreneurial learning opportunities. In this study, we examine whether and how such programs can facilitate startup internationalization. To this end, we leverage a unique dataset that combines proprietary application data from the German Accelerator (GA)-a government-financed program designed to support startups' international market entry-with detailed startup-level, founder, and investment information. We find that participating startups significantly raised funding and hired more employees in the GA's target countries relative to a comparison group of startups that were admitted, but did not attend for exogenous reasons. Consistent with our theoretical considerations about an experiential learning mechanism, these effects are muted for startups that took part in online programs that were introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the results are strongest among startups with limited international experience prior to participating. We further support these mechanisms with qualitative evidence from surveying GA alumni. Our study advances the understanding of the potential and limitations of startup accelerators in supporting international market entry, a key strategy for many entrepreneurial ventures today."}}

Drawing on a translog production function and the decomposition method developed by Kumbhakar et al. in 1999, we analyze a panel dataset of 2,412 publicly listed firms in G7 countries from 1989 to 2023. The findings suggest that climate policy uncertainty does not influence total factor productivity immediately. Instead, its impact emerges over time as firms gradually respond to regulatory shifts. Technological change reacts quickly and positively, indicating that uncertainty can stimulate innovation. Allocative efficiency improves at a slower pace, reflecting the time needed for firms to adjust their resource allocations once policy direction becomes clearer. The effects on scale efficiency vary across firms and are shaped by characteristics such as size and liquidity. Companies with larger cash reserves often delay strategic input adjustments, suggesting that financial flexibility can reduce responsiveness. These outcomes highlight the dynamic and multifaceted nature of corporate adaptation to policy uncertainty. To support long-term productivity gains, climate policies should emphasize clarity, stability, and institutional credibility. Encouraging innovation is important, but helping firms reallocate resources effectively under uncertain conditions is equally essential. A predictable and gradual policy trajectory can reduce unnecessary caution, promote timely adjustments, and facilitate a more efficient transition toward sustainable practices."}}

This study examines the causal relationship between female education and multidimensional energy poverty using quasi-experimental variation from Bangladesh&apos;s Female Secondary School Stipend Program (FSSSP), implemented from 1994 to 2008. Exploiting geographic and temporal variation in program exposure, we employ a two-stage least squares approach with data from three waves (2010, 2016, 2022) of the nationally representative Household Income and Expenditure Survey covering 48,123 households. Each additional year of female education reduces energy poverty by 0.12 points on our multidimensional index, representing a 39% improvement relative to the control group mean. Female education systematically shifts household energy consumption from traditional biomass fuels toward cleaner alternatives, with particularly large effects on severe energy poverty. The impacts operate through multiple mechanisms including economic empowerment (10% increase in wealth), demographic transitions (smaller household size, fewer children), assortative mating (19.5% increase in spouse education), and enhanced infrastructure decision-making agency. Threshold analysis reveals transformative effects at eighth-grade completion, while heterogeneity analysis shows benefits are concentrated among the poorest households. These findings provide the rigorous causal evidence that investments in female education generate substantial co-benefits for energy poverty reduction beyond their direct educational impacts, supporting integrated development approaches that recognize complementarities between human capital investments and energy access objectives."}}

By constructing a multi-component hybrid model based on the CNN-BiLSTM-Transformer architecture, accurate dust concentration prediction is achieved. The system finally adaptively suppresses dust emissions and effectively inhibits dust diffusion through a gas-liquid two-phase spraying mechanism that takes into account dust particle size and concentration. The experimental results confirm the significant advantages of this method: the dust concentration prediction model achieves performance indicators of MAE: 3.4425, RMSE: 4.4319, and R²: 0.9620. The system maintains an average response delay within 5 seconds, the dust suppression efficiency reaches 90.09%, and the overall treatment cost is reduced by 35% compared with traditional methods, thus providing an efficient and cost-effective technical solution for dynamic mine dust control."}}

Our findings challenge the conventional view of slow RER adjustment by demonstrating that larger mispricings are corrected much faster, while smaller deviations persist for longer periods. We identify a valuation threshold effect, where smaller deviations behave like unit root processes, while larger discrepancies are more quickly mean-reverting. Furthermore, the magnitude of these thresholds decrease as the evaluation time horizon increases. Transaction costs play a crucial role in shaping these dynamics, with higher costs associated with wider thresholds for arbitrage activity. Additionally, the results reveal asymmetry in RER adjustments, where undervaluations are corrected more rapidly than overvaluations. These findings provide new insights into the speed and nature of RER adjustments, suggesting that product-specific price data, such as that from iPads, can offer a more granular understanding of international price convergence."}}

Key findings reveal:(1) During 2000-2020, all three ES exhibited significant supply-demand clustering: Low supply-low demand clusters dominated water yield (WY, 20%) and soil retention (SR, 22%), while carbon sequestration (CS) was characterized predominantly by high supply-low demand clusters (26%).(2) The overall ES supply-demand balance deteriorated, with the Composite Ecosystem Supply-Demand Ratio (CESDR) declining from 0.149 to 0.111. This shift manifested spatially as \"dual-core deficit expansion with peripheral surplus contraction\".(3) Primary drivers of CESDR variation were population density (POP, mean β = -0.236), gross domestic product (GDP, mean β = -0.641), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, mean β = 0.322), indicating negative anthropogenic pressures versus positive vegetation-mediated effects.(4) By integrating ES clustering patterns, CESDR dynamics, and key drivers, we delineated Core Restoration Zones, Flexible Regulation Zones, and Ecological Priority Conservation Zones at county and grid scales.

Unlike conventional estimators that dependon idealized array models or extensive calibration, our approach exploitsa tensor-based representation of the received signal to leverage its multidi-mensional structure. A key innovation is the use of a mode-2 tensor factor-ization to decouple time-delay estimation from spatial distortions, yieldinga surrogate cost function that directly measures the time-delay alignmenterror. We then apply Bayesian optimization, guided by a Gaussian processsurrogate and an expected improvement acquisition function, to efficientlynavigate the time-delay parameter space. To guard against outliers andfurther improve accuracy, we integrate a nonlinear least-squares refinementstep using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with bounds (L-BFGS-B)algorithm as a second stage. Simulation results demonstrate that the pro-posed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques such asleast square katri-rao factorization (LSKRF), achieving sub-meter accuracyeven in the presence of array calibration errors and multipath."}}

The network incorporates feeder nodes and routing shipments in the spoke–feeder segment. We also consider wave height uncertainty, which affects cargo handling duration at feeder ports, as observed in a real archipelagic network. Specifically, this involves the enforced use of ship-to-ship (STS) cargo handling in a designated calm area, as opposed to the conventional berthing method in the event of high waves near the jetty. Stochastic optimization is typically used to address this type of problem. However, we found that the stochastic solution provided does not perfectly capture the uncertainty. We thus proposed the integration of stochastic optimization and Monte Carlo simulation, in which a genetic algorithm-based solution is subsequently assessed with a Monte Carlo simulation to generate a risk-optimized solution. A real-world network is used as a case study, showcasing a risk-optimized solution that offers a better likelihood of maintaining performance under uncertainty compared to the solution provided by stochastic optimization.

Leveraging the U.S. China trade war in 2018 as a plausibly exogenous source of negative trade shocks, we find that firms more exposed to the trade shock hire more executives with overseas experience, especially those with marketing expertise and backgrounds in European markets. Consistent with increased demand for such expertise, these executives receive higher compensation following the onset of the trade war, especially through equity-based incentives. We provide suggestive evidence that these executives contribute to maintaining overseas revenue and expanding foreign subsidiaries. Moreover, the stock market responds more negatively to the unexpected departure of such executives during the trade conflict period. Similarly, we document that US firms increased non-Chinese Asia-related representation on their boards. Together, our findings highlight the role of executive human capital in the strategic response of firms to trade shocks."}}

Using high-frequency USD/JPY data and a self-controlled design that compares disclosure days to non-disclosure days, we find that official disclosure leads to a significant appreciation of ¥0.265 per dollar. The effect arises within hours and persists through the day. Market responses reflect the confirmation of intervention rather than surprise about its size, highlighting the role of credibility in FXI effectiveness. Our findings offer a clean identification strategy and underscore how central bank transparency can shape exchange rate dynamics."}}

Unlike conventional voltage balancing methods that rely on supply-side interventions, the proposed human-centric approach leverages the inherent flexibility of user-side loads across networked buildings to achieve a system-wide three-phase voltage balance, while respecting individual preferences. A mathematical model of user-side grid elements, including various classes of household appliances, energy storage systems (ESS), and distributed energy resources (DER) is developed, advancing the knowledge on how human consumption behaviors can be effectively integrated into power system operations. A novel three-phase dynamic pricing mechanism is designed to incentivize phase-specific consumption adjustments, encouraging users to adopt load patterns that contribute to a balanced three-phase voltage state without compromising comfort preferences. The proposed approach serves as a proof of concept for human-centric design in smart grids, operating entirely on the demand side while being robust, scalable, and privacy-preserving, with low computational complexity for users. Simulations illustrate that strategic load scheduling on each phase, driven by the proposed multi-agent model, significantly improves voltage balance, maintains customer comfort, and supports ancillary services such as peak shaving and frequency regulation."}}

However, existing EMT-based FS methods are often constrained by limitations such as homogeneous task generation relying on single filtering strategies and inadequate modeling of complex feature dependencies. Hence, a novel Evolutionary Multi-Task Feature Selection framework using Feature Association Graph (EMT-FAG) is proposed. Within this framework, three interrelated tasks are designed: one focusing on promising features, another exploring the entire feature space, and a third leveraging a dynamic feature association graph to capture and model complex feature interactions. A knowledge transfer mechanism is introduced, enabling efficient inter-task information sharing through particle swarm optimization, which improves optimization efficiency and mitigates premature convergence. This paper also proposes a dual-information fusion filtering method that comprehensively evaluates feature importance by integrating multiple metrics, providing a more robust and comprehensive evaluation framework for high-dimensional feature selection. The proposed framework is extensively validated through experiments on sixteen high-dimensional datasets, and the results demonstrate that EMT-FAG achieves similar or superior performance to state-of-the-art FS algorithms."}}

While most empirical research and policy frameworks emphasize R&D-driven innovation, a growing body of evidence suggests that non-R&D activities—such as organizational changes, marketing strategies, and technology acquisition—play a critical role, particularly in countries with limited R&D capacity. Using firm-level microdata from three consecutive waves (2016–2018, 2018–2020, and 2020–2022) of the Turkish Community Innovation Survey (CIS), the analysis employs a three-stage structural modeling approach: (i) the firm’s decision to engage in non-R&D innovation and the intensity of such investments, estimated using a generalized Tobit model; (ii) the conversion of these investments into non-technological innovation outputs, analyzed through an instrumented probit model; and (iii) the effect of these outputs on labor productivity, proxied by the logarithm of sales per employee. The results indicate a robust and statistically significant effect of non-R&D investment intensity on non-technological innovation outcomes, with particularly strong effects observed during the 2018–2020 period. Moreover, both non-technological innovation and the direct intensity of non-R&D investments are found to enhance firm productivity, with non-R&D intensity exerting a direct effect even after controlling for innovation outputs. These findings underscore the critical role of non-R&D innovation in boosting productivity in developing economies with constrained R&D capacity, thereby addressing the limitations of R&D-centric models."}}

We calibrate the model to the Portuguese economy and find that the type of auction used has quantitative implications. In particular, discriminatory auctions generate spreads that provide a better fit to the data. In a counterfactual, we find that switching to a uniform protocol constitutes a Pareto improvement, and that the difference in welfare is highest during crises (0.6 percent of permanent consumption). Finally, we find that accounting for dynamic effects is crucial. In a single auction setting, a risk averse government prefers the discriminatory protocol. However, with repeated auctions, the properties of the discriminatory protocol incentivize over-borrowing. The anticipatory effect it has on prices makes the uniform protocol a better option."}}

We first establish a prudent debt anchor for Ireland by calibrating CIT shocks and simulating possible debt trajectories. Second, we propose an operational rule based on multi-year expenditure ceilings. The ceilings are calibrated such as to stabilize debt at the anchor level while accounting for the economy’s cyclical position.

We find that cumulative income losses could reach up to 18.6 percent by 2050 and 50.6 percent by 2100. The analysis further shows that scaling up investments in structural resilience and adaptation can partially mitigate these losses—raising output by up to 12.3 percent by 2050 and 31 percent by 2100—while also generating long-term fiscal savings."}}

We identify monetary policy shocks using forecast errors from Brazi’s daily Focus survey of professional forecasters. We then estimate the pass-through to lending rates based on an instrumental variable application of local projections and find an aggregate pass-through of 70 percent after four months, reflecting full passthrough to market-based lending rates and 20 percent to government-directed credit interest rates. Analysis using bank-level data reveals varying degrees of pass-through across credit types, from 40 percent for payrollbacked loans to 80 percent for working capital loans, and stronger pass-through for larger banks. Estimated pass-through has increased since 2020 due to more responsive corporate loans"}}

Analyzing data from nine countries with notable MMF sectors post-pandemic, it examines three main drivers: yield differentials between MMFs and bank deposits, banking turmoils that affect perceptions of relative safety for traditional cash options, and structural characteristics (types) of MMFs. The findings indicate that MMFs attract capital during rising interest rates driven primarily by yield-seeking behavior. This pattern persisted following the 2023 banking turmoil, particularly in the U.S., where yield remained the dominant driver. After accounting for yield differentials, MMF growth was not unusually high compared to previous hiking cycles, suggesting limited evidence of widespread flight-to-safety flows. Moreover, when MMF yields rise, investors in the US and the euro area increasingly favor private debt MMFs, likely due to their higher yields. The study underscores the trade-off between safety and yield in investor behaviour, providing insights for policymakers on enhancing financial stability."}}
