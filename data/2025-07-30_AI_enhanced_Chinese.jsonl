The conditions of these coral lifeforms greatly determine fish associations and distribution. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of coral reef benthic conditions on associated with fish assemblages. This research used monitoring data in 2018. Coral data was taken using transect intercept points for corals, visual census data for coral fish, which were classified into functional fish (herbivores) and key fish species for coral fisheries (carnivores). The data had been analyzed by using principal component analysis and hierarchical classification. The results showed that there was a strong interaction between fish and coral lifeforms. The interactions occurring were more varied in space and time, which affected the composition of fish community, and the spatial pattern in coral reef ecosystem. Changes in coral lifeforms and live cover had the potential to limit reef fish populations. Furthermore, the presence of herbivore and carnivore fish was proportional in coral reef ecosystem. The future research challenge is to formulate the policies needed to maintain the condition of coral reefs as a whole."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u5e95\u6816\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9c7c\u7c7b\u7fa4\u843d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73ca\u745a\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u9c7c\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u73ca\u745a\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u9c7c\u7c7b\u79cd\u7fa4\u3002", "research_question": "\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u5e95\u6816\u6761\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9c7c\u7c7b\u7fa4\u843d\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5e03\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73ca\u745a\u5f62\u6001\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9c7c\u7c7b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e0e\u9c7c\u7c7b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u73ca\u745a\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u9c7c\u7c7b\u7fa4\u843d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282018\u5e74\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u73ca\u745a\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u622a\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73ca\u745a\u9c7c\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u666e\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "\u73ca\u745a\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u9c7c\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u73ca\u745a\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u9c7c\u7c7b\u79cd\u7fa4\uff1b\u8349\u98df\u6027\u548c\u8089\u98df\u6027\u9c7c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5747\u8861\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73ca\u745a\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u9c7c\u7c7b\u7fa4\u843d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Sustainable Life Management (SLM) system, a novel machine learning framework that quantifies task complexity (demand) and available capacity (supply) to optimize personal productivity. The system employs sentence transformers to analyze task descriptions and predict energy demands, while leveraging historical completion patterns through reinforcement learning to estimate daily supply capacity. We formalize the problem as a constrained optimization task and prove the convergence of our allocation algorithm. Preliminary results from real-world task data demonstrate that SLM achieves a 23% improvement in task completion rates and a 31% reduction in deadline violations compared to traditional urgencybased prioritization. The framework provides both numerical metrics and thematic insights, enabling users to make informed decisions in navigating life's uncertainties while maintaining sustainable productivity levels."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6d3b\u7ba1\u7406\uff08SLM\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u4eba\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u622a\u6b62\u65e5\u671f\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u4eba\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u7e41\u591a\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08\u9700\u6c42\uff09\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u4f9b\u7ed9\uff09\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u53e5\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53e5\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u65e5\u4f9b\u7ed9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "findings": "SLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8623%\uff0c\u622a\u6b62\u65e5\u671f\u8fdd\u89c4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8631%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3002"}}

In collaboration with an online education platform, this study examines the impact of hometown ties on sales performance. Using a randomized assignment of salespeople to customers via WeChat, an instant messaging app, we find that shared hometown ties between the two parties significantly improve sales performance, even in the absence of physical interaction. Customer-salesperson pairs from the same hometown achieve a conversion rate 21% higher compared to non-hometown pairs. Further analysis shows that salespeople, when communicating with customers from the same hometown, are more likely to strategically use dialects to foster stronger relational bonds and enhance persuasion. This kind of hometown effect is amplified for customers with more pronounced cultural identities and when hometown ties are more coincidental, highlighting the nuanced interplay of cultural and incidental similarities. Our findings offer valuable managerial insights for optimizing salesforce strategies in digital B2C environments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8001\u4e61\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u9500\u552e\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8001\u4e61\u5173\u7cfb\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9500\u552e\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5316B2C\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "research_question": "\u8001\u4e61\u5173\u7cfb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9500\u552e\u7ee9\u6548\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u9500\u552e\u4eba\u5458\u4e0e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u6587\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6587\u5316\u8ba4\u540c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u8425\u9500\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u4fe1\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u9500\u552e\u4eba\u5458\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8001\u4e61\u4e0e\u975e\u8001\u4e61\u5bf9\u7684\u9500\u552e\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "findings": "\u8001\u4e61\u5bf9\u7684\u9500\u552e\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u6bd4\u975e\u8001\u4e61\u5bf9\u9ad821%\uff0c\u9500\u552e\u4eba\u5458\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u8a00\u52a0\u5f3a\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u8ba4\u540c\u548c\u5076\u7136\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u9500\u552e\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5316B2C\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9500\u552e\u56e2\u961f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

However, their misuse has increasingly led to systemic inefficiencies and undue hardship, particularly for banks wrongly joined in proceedings without evidence that they hold the debtor's funds. Creditors frequently list multiple banks arbitrarily, leading to wasted judicial time, inflated legal costs, and disruption of banking operations. This practice contradicts settled legal principles and has raised concerns among courts and stakeholders. With the nationwide adoption of the Bank Verification Number (BVN) and the operational capabilities of the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), it is now possible to verify the existence of a judgment debtor's account in a specific bank before initiating garnishee proceedings. Yet, this technology remains underutilized in the legal process. This article examines the legal framework governing garnishee proceedings in Nigeria, the burdens placed on financial institutions under current practices, and relevant case law emphasizing that garnishees must not be joined without a factual basis. It further explores the potential of BVN-linked account tracing as a prelitigation verification tool. By assessing the roles of the courts, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and NIBSS, the article proposes a reform framework that balances judgment enforcement with financial system integrity."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u6263\u6b3e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6ee5\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u94f6\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53f7\u7801\uff08BVN\uff09\u548c\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u94f6\u884c\u95f4\u7ed3\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08NIBSS\uff09\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u6263\u6b3e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6539\u9769\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\uff08\u5982BVN\u548cNIBSS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u6263\u6b3e\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6ee5\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u53f8\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6263\u6b3e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6ee5\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u53f8\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3001\u94f6\u884c\u8fd0\u8425\u53d7\u963b\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u9769\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u6263\u6b3e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5224\u4f8b\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5224\u4f8b\u6cd5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\uff08BVN\u548cNIBSS\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "findings": "\u5f53\u524d\u6263\u6b3e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b58\u5728\u6ee5\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0cBVN\u548cNIBSS\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bc9\u8bbc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u52a0\u5165\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6263\u6b3e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6cd5\u9662\u3001\u592e\u884c\u548cNIBSS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5224\u51b3\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002"}}

However, these grasslands are increasingly threatened by the encroachment of woody species, particularly <em>Juniperus recurva</em>, which diminishes forage availability. This study assessed vegetation dynamics and evaluated the impact of a mechanical pruning intervention implemented in Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park to restore grassland health and support herders' needs. Using a Before After Control Impact (BACI) design, key vegetation parameters such as species richness, percent cover, palatable biomass, and woody regeneration density were measured in treated and untreated plots. The results showed that pruning significantly reduced the dominance of <em>Juniperus recurva</em> and improved the availability of palatable herbaceous species. Species richness and forage cover increased notably in treated plots compared to controls. Interviews with herders confirmed declining pasture conditions and underscored the relevance of such interventions. The study highlights the effectiveness of targeted mechanical interventions in restoring grassland condition and suggests that integrating ecological research with local herder knowledge can guide sustainable pasture management. These findings contribute to evidence-based conservation planning and offer valuable insights for enhancing the resilience of Himalayan grazing systems under changing environmental conditions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u673a\u68b0\u4fee\u526a\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u4e0d\u4e39\u4e9a\u9ad8\u5c71\u8349\u5730\u7684\u690d\u88ab\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4fee\u526a\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86Juniperus recurva\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8349\u5730\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7267\u8349\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "research_question": "\u673a\u68b0\u4fee\u526a\u5e72\u9884\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u4e0d\u4e39\u4e9a\u9ad8\u5c71\u8349\u5730\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7267\u6c11\u7684\u751f\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e9a\u9ad8\u5c71\u8349\u5730\u5bf9\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u5c71\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7266\u725b\u653e\u7267\u751f\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7Juniperus recurva\u5165\u4fb5\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7267\u8349\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8349\u5730\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7267\u573a\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528BACI\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u672a\u5904\u7406\u5730\u5757\u7684\u690d\u88ab\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u7269\u79cd\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u98df\u7528\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u4fee\u526a\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86Juniperus recurva\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7267\u8349\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7269\u79cd\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8349\u5730\u6062\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7267\u6c11\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8349\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

In response, this paper presents a problematization review that critiques and revises three widely held assumptions about digital innovations: 1) that they generate net benefits that outweigh the associated harm; 2) that their ethicality can be calculated through utility; and 3) that their harms can be mitigated through technological, corporate, or regulatory intervention. We argue that compassion provides a pluralistic ethical foundation that integrates the strengths of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. This framework prioritises serving all stakeholders, especially the most vulnerable, while avoiding harm. It sets a research agenda focused on addressing structural dysfunctions, amplifying marginalised voices, and fostering sustainable systems. By reimagining digital innovation as a force for the common good, this paper contributes to a more just and equitable digital future for all."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u5316\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u540c\u60c5\u5fc3\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u591a\u5143\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u516c\u6b63\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u672a\u6765\u3002", "research_question": "\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u60c5\u5fc3\u7684\u591a\u5143\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5371\u5bb3\u89c6\u4e3a\u201c\u610f\u5916\u540e\u679c\u201d\u800c\u975e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u4e49\u52a1\u8bba\u548c\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u591a\u5143\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u60c5\u5fc3\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u3002", "method": "\u95ee\u9898\u5316\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u73b0\u6709\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "findings": "\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u6216\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e72\u9884\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u53d8\u9769\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u540c\u60c5\u5fc3\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u591a\u5143\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u4f26\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f26\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

Through conceptual policy analysis of EU legislation, communications, and recent developments, we challenge the assumption that deregulation inherently fosters innovation. We demonstrate that eliminating harmonized liability rules creates a paradoxical outcome: increased regulatory complexity through fragmentation across 27 national regimes. This fragmentation disproportionately burdens European AI companies-particularly startups and SMEs-attempting to scale across the Single Market, while advantaging large non-EU tech companies with greater resources to navigate regulatory complexity. Drawing on empirical evidence across sectors, we argue that well-designed liability frameworks can actually catalyze innovation by establishing market certainty, building consumer trust, and creating positive incentives for safety. We propose integrating liability considerations into Europe's broader digital sovereignty strategy through targeted harmonization of specific liability aspects and innovation-enabling frameworks, including regulatory sandboxes and complianceby-design toolkits. This approach positions liability rules as enablers rather than impediments to sustainable technological advancement in the global AI landscape."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e862025\u5e742\u6708\u6b27\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u64a4\u56de\u300a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8d23\u4efb\u6307\u4ee4\u300b\uff08AILD\uff09\u5bf9\u6b27\u6d32\u6280\u672f\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u53bb\u76d1\u7ba1\u5fc5\u7136\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u8c03\u8d23\u4efb\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u76df\u64a4\u56deAILD\u5bf9\u6b27\u6d32\u6280\u672f\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u53bb\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u6b27\u6d32AI\u516c\u53f8\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\uff09\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u8c03\u8d23\u4efb\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u76d1\u7ba1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6b27\u76df\u7acb\u6cd5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u53ca\u6700\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "findings": "\u53bb\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bfc\u81f427\u56fd\u5236\u5ea6\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6b27\u6d32\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u800c\u534f\u8c03\u8d23\u4efb\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e02\u573a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u53bb\u76d1\u7ba1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d23\u4efb\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u8d23\u4efb\u6846\u67b6\u7eb3\u5165\u6570\u5b57\u4e3b\u6743\u6218\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u8c03\u8d23\u4efb\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982\u76d1\u7ba1\u6c99\u76d2\uff09\u3002"}}

The former reflects the sector\u2019s potential to pivot toward transformative technologies like hydrogen and electrification, while the latter captures the importance of public trust, funding alignment, and social legitimacy. A transition-centric Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis framework is proposed to evaluate trade-offs across technological, operational, regulatory, and sociocultural dimensions. The study also identifies Public-Private Enterprises as key organizing mechanisms to support innovation scaling, infrastructure readiness, and stakeholder coordination.

The position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments (e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work engages with objections to the love understood as concatenation, particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive components are linked.

In particular, subjective well-being was examined through community belonging and immersion among fans. Structural equation modeling yielded the following results.

Using real case studies from Rwanda's innovation hubs, Kenya's digital governance infrastructure, and Nigeria's energy transition programs, we expose deep structural misalignments between the epistemic assumptions of imported models and the systemic logic of African societies. The Moleka Grid enables a shift from imitation to ontological innovation-redesigning NIS as pluriversal ecosystems of transformation grounded in local metaphysics, communal intelligences, and systemic wisdom.

Our findings show that UPI disproportionately benefited low-infrastructure banks in expanding mobile banking activity, thereby narrowing the digital performance gap. Furthermore, we observe spillover effects, where enhanced digital engagement led to increased use of traditional banking channels such as debit card transactions. This study contributes to IS research by theorizing DPuI as a platform-based public good that reconfigures participation and value creation in digital ecosystems. We extend platform and coopetition theory by conceptualizing DPuI as an institutional equalizer and a new governance archetype, illustrating how digital public infrastructures can reshape competitive dynamics and enable inclusive innovation at the institutional level.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u652f\u4ed8\u63a5\u53e3\uff08UPI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff08DPuI\uff09\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u548c\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u663e\u8457\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f4e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u94f6\u884c\u7f29\u5c0f\u6570\u5b57\u7ee9\u6548\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u94f6\u884c\u6e20\u9053\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u6570\u5b57\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff08DPuI\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u521b\u9020\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6570\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u5e73\u53f0\u751f\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e73\u53f0\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5e73\u53f0\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5408\u4f5c\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u94f6\u884c\u9ad8\u7ba1\u8bbf\u8c08\uff09\u548c\u9762\u677f\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff082014-2023\u5e7430\u5bb6\u5370\u5ea6\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff09\u3002", "findings": "UPI\u663e\u8457\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f4e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u94f6\u884c\u6269\u5927\u79fb\u52a8\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u52a1\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u6570\u5b57\u7ee9\u6548\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5982\u589e\u52a0\u501f\u8bb0\u5361\u4ea4\u6613\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06DPuI\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u578b\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDPuI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5236\u5ea6\u5747\u8861\u5668\u548c\u65b0\u6cbb\u7406\u539f\u578b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u5b57\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

Grounded in systems thinking, chaos theory, karmic ethics, and the Moral Nash Paradox, the Wisdom Layer includes four core agents that analyze fragility, ripple effects, ethical impact, and structural drift.

The paper describes core design principles (e.g., Reverse Wisdom Entropy, mirror-not-master, agentic scaffolding) and shares qualitative insights from prototype testing. This work demonstrates that wisdom-often dismissed as intangible-can be made visible, interactive, and extensible. The result is not just a tool, but a cognitive infrastructure for thinking more wisely at scale."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u667a\u6167\u71b5\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u667a\u6167\u5c42\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316AI\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u667a\u6167\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9632\u6b62\u667a\u6167\u71b5\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5feb\u8282\u594f\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u667a\u6167\u6b63\u5728\u6084\u7136\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u7eb3\u4ec0\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5206\u6790\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u6d9f\u6f2a\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316AI\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u539f\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982IT\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u5236\u5ea6\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u667a\u6167\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u667a\u6167\u71b5\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u667a\u6167\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7AI\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Drawing on published work from major fields in business administration and economics, we examine interventions targeting consumer demand, supplier behavior, data and privacy issues, AI, and platform business models. Field experiments allow for credible causal inference in live, dynamic settings where user choices, platform design, and algorithmic logic are tightly interwoven. By reviewing findings across domains such as e-commerce, online labor, dating, and social media, we uncover recurring empirical regularities-such as trade-offs between personalization and privacy, transparency and engagement, and automation and trust.

The right to be forgotten, which came to the agenda with the Google decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014, has been the subject of many current national and international regulations and court decisions. The right to be forgotten has gained legal status as a right under the name of \"right to erasure\" for the first time with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which entered into force on 25 May 2018.

The effects of the damage done can be catastrophic in terms of financial fraud, poor customer experience, and damage to the brand. Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) face a massive challenge in this regard; they must overcome fraud while staying compliant with Department of Telecommunication (DOT) regulations. Most telecom service providers are currently using standard techniques for customer identity validation and verification, which are ineffective in detecting and controlling subscription fraud.</p>\n<p>In this project, the researchers have: (i) Assessed the risks in the current customer identity verification process, (ii) Analysed the SIM registration policies in 160 countries,&nbsp;iii) Proposed multi-channel online identification validation methods, including knowledge-based validation, phone authentication, address validation, and one-time password use. The recommendations proposed are based on a multi-layered risk-based approach that leverages intelligent analytics, predictive decision policies and knowledge-based authentication to enable real-time identity verification and regulatory compliance.

This paper selects the top five sales models from the \"Dongche Di\" platform as research subjects. It employs web scraping technology to collect online consumer review data, utilizing word cloud and semantic network analyses to identify and explore the potential correlations in consumer attention. The LDA-LSTM model is applied to classify the primary demands and opinion trends of consumers, capturing the emotional trends and dynamic characteristics of each category. The results indicate that endurance, driving experience, interior space, price range, and high-speed capability are the key considerations for consumers when purchasing new energy vehicle products. Consumers exhibit a higher level of negative emotion regarding driving experience, a lower level of negative emotion concerning interior space, and an overall lack of high satisfaction in emotional tendencies. Based on the four steps of Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE), this paper analyzes five consumer-focused aspects: range capability, driving experience, interior space, price range, and highway performance. It proposes recommendations across four dimensions:\u00a0building a brand identity to enhance salience, refining brand image to crystallize unique value, leveraging brand evaluations to guide encourage feedback, and strengthening customer stickiness loyalty foster brand resonance."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u80fd\u6e90\u6c7d\u8f66\u54c1\u724c\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\uff0c\u5229\u7528LDA-LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCBBE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u54c1\u724c\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5728\u8d2d\u4e70\u65b0\u80fd\u6e90\u6c7d\u8f66\u65f6\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u8d8b\u52bf\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u80fd\u6e90\u6c7d\u8f66\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eCBBE\uff08Customer-Based Brand Equity\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56db\u6b65\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u722c\u866b\u6280\u672f\u6536\u96c6\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u4e91\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u53caLDA-LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u7eed\u822a\u3001\u9a7e\u9a76\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u5185\u9970\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u9ad8\u901f\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4f53\u9a8c\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u5185\u9970\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9ad8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86CBBE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u80fd\u6e90\u6c7d\u8f66\u54c1\u724c\u4ef7\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u54c1\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5f62\u8c61\u5851\u9020\u3001\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7c98\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u54c1\u724c\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

We adopt the Shapley value from cooperative game theory as that benchmark and argue that an incentive-compatible protocol should allocate rewards close to its Shapley prediction. We develop a unified analytical framework that (i) models four canonical designs (pre-PBS, PBS, MP, IL); (ii) derives closed-form Shapley values for each player class; and (iii) interprets shifts in these values as changes in structural bargaining power. Applying 2024 Ethereum data to the model result under PBS, we estimate concrete Shapley shares and contrast them with observed payouts. The gap is informative: searchers are systematically over-paid, whereas relays are under-compensated-findings that align with recent market structure and rising centralization risk.

Not only has this innovation facilitated the rapid diffusion of information, but it has also given consumers the ability to engage with companies all over the world. And while this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and in most cases it is a good thing, it has become an issue with companies being able to gather more information on individuals than ever before. This has, in turn, drastically increased the cost of outside actors stealing valuable information from companies, of which they use to commit identity theft. Therefore, with companies not accounting for this cost when they collect information, it has created a negative externality within society. That is why I recommend that the Senate Committee on the Judiciary create and recommend a policy called Preemptive Measures. This policy would state that any entity that holds the critical information of 10,000 or more individuals would be required to not only share what information they are collecting, sharing, and storing, with their customers, but they would also be required to give their customers the ability to delete their critical information.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u5316\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u516c\u53f8\u6536\u96c6\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\u201d\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u516c\u53f8\u900f\u660e\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u5ba2\u6237\u5220\u9664\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u53f8\u6536\u96c6\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8d1f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u5316\u5e02\u573a\u4f7f\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u591f\u6536\u96c6\u5927\u91cf\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u4f1a\u8d1f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d1f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\u201d\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u516c\u53f8\u900f\u660e\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u5ba2\u6237\u5220\u9664\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8d1f\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

This Article investigates whether Turkish patent law currently allows for, or should allow for, the recognition of AI systems as inventors. Drawing on an interdisciplinary, doctrinal, and comparative legal methodology, it assesses the claim that AI systems, such as DABUS, can independently generate patentable inventions. Despite assertions of full autonomy, the Article finds that human input remains indispensable throughout the invention process\u2014including during the training, configuration, and problem-formulation stages\u2014undermining the basis for recognizing AI systems as inventors under existing legal definitions.&nbsp;<span>A comparative review of international case law reveals consistent legal resistance to AI inventorship: patent offices and courts in the United Kingdom, European Patent Organization, United States, Germany, and Australia have uniformly rejected DABUS-based applications. Even where statutes do not explicitly define 'inventor,' all jurisdictions agree\u2014either normatively or judicially\u2014that only natural persons can hold this status. The Article also analyzes Turkish law in light of these developments. Although the Turkish Industrial Property Code (SMK) does not define 'inventor,' it attaches personal rights and obligations to the inventorship, such as moral rights and disclosure duties, which inherently imply the need for legal personality.&nbsp;</span><span>In addressing ownership claims over AI-generated inventions, the Article evaluates whether the doctrine of </span><span>accession</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>or other </span><span>instances of involuntary legal transfer</span><span>\u2014such as inheritance upon death or&nbsp;</span>equitable subrogation<span>\u2014could justify conferring rights on a person other than the human inventor. However, none of these scenarios neatly map onto the case of AI outputs, which are not natural fruits or extensions of human labor in the traditional legal sense. The Article finds that applying the doctrine of accession to intangible, non-biological AI-generated outputs stretches the logic of the principle beyond recognition and introduces unacceptable legal uncertainty.&nbsp;</span><span>In light of these findings, the Article proposes a future-oriented solution: creating a </span><span><i>sui generis</i></span><span> category of 'machine inventions,' under which limited patent protection could be granted to natural or legal persons who materially invest in or train AI systems that produce such inventions.

It seeks to reposition GenAI from a backstage tool to a tourism actor and to present the Synthetic Experience System, a triadic framework connecting Tourist, GenAI, and Place/Community through data, content, and emotion layers.&nbsp; <br><br>Methods: The paper follows an integrative theory building approach.

Results indicate that extremely hot days (? 100\u00baF) are related to increased time spent at work not working, particularly among women in non-supervised occupations. On these days, women in non-supervised occupations spend 6.79 more minutes at work not working compared to comfortable temperature days. Men, by contrast, do not exhibit significant changes in non-work time at work. Furthermore, the results align with increased worker bargaining power during economic expansions, which facilitates labor supply adjustments on extremely hot days, and with hypotheses regarding adaptation and acclimation to high temperatures in warmer counties. These findings underscore the relevance of temperature as a determinant of worker effort, reveal a previously overlooked margin of labor adjustment, and highlight the moderating role of occupational supervision in shaping behavioral responses to environmental stressors."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u6e29\u5bf9\u5de5\u4eba\u52aa\u529b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6e29\u5bfc\u81f4\u5973\u6027\u5728\u975e\u76d1\u7763\u5c97\u4f4d\u7684\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u7537\u6027\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4eba\u8bae\u4ef7\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u6e29\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "research_question": "\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u6e29\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4eba\u52aa\u529b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u6e29\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5de5\u4eba\u8bae\u4ef7\u80fd\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u9ad8\u6e29\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ATUS 2003-2019\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0e\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u6e29\uff08\u2265100\u00baF\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u5973\u6027\u5728\u975e\u76d1\u7763\u5c97\u4f4d\u7684\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a06.79\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u7537\u6027\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4eba\u8bae\u4ef7\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u6e29\u9002\u5e94\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4eba\u52aa\u529b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u804c\u4e1a\u76d1\u7763\u5728\u73af\u5883\u538b\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6e29\u5bf9\u5de5\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Yet many low-income families face a dual digital divide: limited access to technology and limited ability to use it effectively. These gaps can undermine adults&apos; ability to support their children&apos;s education, restrict access to public services, and reduce their own employability. Despite growing policy attention, rigorous evidence on how to close these gaps\u0097especially among disadvantaged adults in high-income countries\u0097remains scarce. We evaluate the impact of a comprehensive digital inclusion program in Turin, Italy, targeting 859 low-income families with school-aged children. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment arms, each combining a free tablet with internet access and digital literacy training of different durations. One year later, treated participants reported large improvements in daily technology use and digital skills, as measured by the \"Digital Skills Indicator 2.0\" (DSI) developed by Eurostat. Parents also became more confident in guiding their children&apos;s online activities, more engaged in digital parenting, and more likely to access public services digitally. We find no effects on employment or job search behavior, but treated participants expressed greater optimism about future training prospects. The effects are statistically similar across the two training intensities, suggesting that (i) once basic barriers are removed, digital engagement can become self-sustaining, and/or (ii) that the returns to digital training are strongly diminishing. Mediation analysis confirms that digital skills \u0097 not just access \u0097 are key drivers of broader behavioral and economic outcomes. Sequential effects are particularly strong in the domains of social inclusion and parenting. The findings underscore the importance of addressing both financial and learning constraints and suggest that bundled interventions can foster inclusive digital participation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u610f\u5927\u5229\u90fd\u7075\u4e00\u9879\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5305\u5bb9\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u514d\u8d39\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u57f9\u8bad\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u65e5\u5e38\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5c31\u4e1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u7f29\u5c0f\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u9762\u4e34\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6559\u80b2\u652f\u6301\u3001\u516c\u5171\u670d\u52a1\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5c31\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5305\u5bb9\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c859\u6237\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u5206\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u57f9\u8bad\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7ec4\u3002", "findings": "\u5e72\u9884\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u65e5\u5e38\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bb6\u957f\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u80b2\u513f\u4fe1\u5fc3\u548c\u516c\u5171\u670d\u52a1\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5c31\u4e1a\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u80fd\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6280\u672f\u8bbf\u95ee\uff09\u662f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u7efc\u5408\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u8bbe\u5907+\u57f9\u8bad\uff09\u5bf9\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6570\u5b57\u5305\u5bb9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u878d\u5165\u548c\u80b2\u513f\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

We collect a new dataset which consists of all collaborative posts between 260 large beauty/clothing brands and small creators, as well as a daily panel of follower counts for creators. Leveraging the high frequency of the panel, we identify changes in creators' follower counts after the collaborative post in a difference-in-differences analysis. We address creator and post content selection through propensity score matching, using creator characteristics and LLM-derived visual content embeddings to match treatment and control posts. Our estimates suggest that exposure to a brand's audience through a collaborative post increases a creator's cumulative followers by 0.47%, or roughly one week's worth of growth. Although larger brand audiences lead to more growth all else equal, larger brands tend to have less engaged followers and lower quality collaborative posts. This leads to stable treatment effects from collaboration with brands that have between 0.7m and 8.6m followers. The top 10% of collaborations average 2.1% follower growth for the creator. Our average conversion rate from brand followers to creator followers is similar to the effect of online display ads estimated in the literature."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528Instagram\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5e16\u5b50\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5c0f\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u54c1\u724c\u53d7\u4f17\u66dd\u5149\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u5e16\u5b50\u5e73\u5747\u5e26\u67650.47%\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5c55\u793a\u5e7f\u544a\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5c0f\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u54c1\u724c\u534f\u4f5c\u5e16\u5b50\u66dd\u5149\u5bf9\u5176\u7c89\u4e1d\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u54c1\u724c\u534f\u4f5c\u5bf9\u5c0f\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5173\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u66dd\u5149\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8425\u9500\u3001\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u54c1\u724c\u5408\u4f5c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u534f\u4f5c\u5e16\u5b50\u5bf9\u7c89\u4e1d\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u5904\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "findings": "\u534f\u4f5c\u5e16\u5b50\u5e73\u5747\u5e26\u67650.47%\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e\u54c1\u724c\u7c89\u4e1d\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u54c1\u724c\u534f\u4f5c\u5bf9\u5c0f\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8425\u9500\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u5c0f\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While the continent contributes 14% of global methane emissions, only 2% of global climate finance is allocated toward addressing this potent greenhouse gas. This paper examines the Africa Methane Abatement Bond (AMAB) as an innovative financial mechanism to bridge this gap and help countries attain their Nationally Determined Contributions. Anchored in a multi-phase framework and piloted in Angola, Egypt, and Nigeria, AMAB aims to unlock sustainable finance for methane mitigation, focusing on key sectors such as agriculture, energy, and waste. Through a synthesis of financing trends, sector-specific data, and institutional frameworks, this paper proposes pathways for scaling AMAB continent-wide. It advocates for standardized project aggregation, policy coherence, and green bond certification systems aligned with global standards. The paper concludes that scaling the AMAB can position Africa as a leader in methane abatement while catalyzing its transition to a resilient, inclusive green economy."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u975e\u6d32\u7532\u70f7\u51cf\u6392\u503a\u5238\uff08AMAB\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u975e\u6d32\u7532\u70f7\u51cf\u6392\u8d44\u91d1\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u4e3b\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5728\u5b89\u54e5\u62c9\u3001\u57c3\u53ca\u3001\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u8bd5\u70b9\uff0cAMAB\u805a\u7126\u519c\u4e1a\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u5e9f\u5f03\u7269\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9879\u76ee\u805a\u5408\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u5927\u9646\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982AMAB\uff09\u586b\u8865\u975e\u6d32\u7532\u70f7\u51cf\u6392\u8d44\u91d1\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\uff1f", "motivation": "\u975e\u6d32\u5360\u5168\u7403\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\u768414%\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u83b7\u5f972%\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u65b0\u91d1\u878d\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u7532\u70f7\u51cf\u6392\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u91d1\u878d\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u878d\u8d44\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAMAB\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "findings": "AMAB\u8bd5\u70b9\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9879\u76ee\u805a\u5408\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u534f\u8c03\u662f\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5173\u952e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u521b\u65b0\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u5236\uff08AMAB\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u7532\u70f7\u51cf\u6392\u8d44\u91d1\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u51cf\u6392\u91d1\u878d\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7eff\u8272\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

Results show that the positive impact of this housing policy on housing wealth growth significantly fosters household consumption per capita by around 1275 yuan. Further, this work analyses the heterogeneous effect of consumption categories, hukou status, and year of education on household consumption and savings. The analysis finds that food consumption has been significantly encouraged; residents who hold urban hukou, have received intermediate education and high education, consume more, compared to those with low education, tend to decrease their consumption. Lastly, residents with intermediate education are likely to reduce savings, while low and high-education residents would save more."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u65ad\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u4e862006\u5e74\u4f4f\u623f\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u4f4f\u623f\u8d22\u5bcc\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u4eba\u5747\u6d88\u8d39\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u7ea61275\u5143\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6d88\u8d39\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u6237\u7c4d\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u5e74\u9650\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "research_question": "\u4f4f\u623f\u8d22\u5bcc\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u6d88\u8d39\u548c\u50a8\u84c4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f4f\u623f\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4f\u623f\u8d22\u5bcc\u8fdb\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4f4f\u623f\u8d22\u5bcc\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u5f52\u65ad\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08Regression Discontinuity Design\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u4f4f\u623f\u653f\u7b56\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bb6\u5ead\u4eba\u5747\u6d88\u8d39\uff08\u7ea61275\u5143\uff09\uff1b\u98df\u54c1\u6d88\u8d39\u589e\u957f\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u57ce\u5e02\u6237\u7c4d\u3001\u4e2d\u7b49\u53ca\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u6d88\u8d39\u66f4\u591a\uff0c\u4f4e\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u6d88\u8d39\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b\u4e2d\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u50a8\u84c4\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f4e\u53ca\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u50a8\u84c4\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4f4f\u623f\u8d22\u5bcc\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bb6\u5ead\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4f\u623f\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This systematic review investigates the emerging role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in enabling predictive maintenance (PdM) of power transformers. Drawing upon 126 peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2024, this review categorizes and synthesizes state-of-the-art techniques involving sensor integration, real-time condition monitoring, data fusion, machine learning (ML), deep learning, and digital twin frameworks. The analysis reveals a growing trend toward hybrid PdM models that leverage transformer health indices, vibration and thermal imaging, dissolved gas analysis (DGA), and partial discharge (PD) data. Neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, and ensemble methods dominate the AI approaches, while IoTbased sensor networks and cloud-edge computing architectures underpin the system infrastructures. Key challenges identified include data heterogeneity, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, high initial costs, and lack of standardization in deployment practices. This review concludes that integrating AI and IoT in transformer maintenance not only enhances fault detection and failure prediction but also supports asset lifecycle optimization and grid resilience. The findings contribute to academic research and industrial applications by providing a consolidated framework for future development, standardization, and policy formulation in smart grid systems."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\uff08IoT\uff09\u5728\u7535\u529b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\uff08PdM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86126\u7bc72015-2024\u5e74\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u529b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7535\u529b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6545\u969c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u505c\u673a\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff09\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0126\u7bc72015-2024\u5e74\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u548cIoT\u5728\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "findings": "\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u5065\u5eb7\u6307\u6570\u3001\u632f\u52a8\u3001\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u6eb6\u89e3\u6c14\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u653e\u7535\u6570\u636e\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1bAI\u548cIoT\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u652f\u6301\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This study examines the determinants of infrastructure development in Kenya using a time series data analysis framework, with data spanning from 2003 to 2024. The study's main estimates use the generalized-method-of-moments (GMM) estimator that allows us to account for the potential endogeneity of the infrastructure and explanatory variables through the use of instruments. The results of this study showed that economic growth, public debt, and foreign direct investment have a significant positive influence on infrastructure development in Kenya.

In order to promote infrastructure development, Kenya needs to achieve sustainable economic growth, manage public debt cautiously, and attract foreign direct investment.

The changes are likely to have a major impact on the overall level of capital and its distribution across banks and asset classes. This paper examines the effects of the proposed changes in capital rules on the Swiss loan market. Using primarily public information, we estimate the effects on the capital of individual Swiss banks broken down by asset class. We infer what this is likely to imply for lending rates in the Swiss market. We find that the proposed rule changes would substantially boost capital overall, affecting most severely capital for Corporate and Specialised Lending exposures. Under the BCBS 347 proposals, total bank capital would rise 39% while capital for Corporate and Specialised Lending exposures would increase by 142% and 130%, respectively. This allocation of capital across asset classes is inconsistent with the lessons of the recent financial crisis which was triggered by the collapse of the US residential mortgage market and involved relatively little impact on the quality of corporate credit. By our calculations, bank spreads for corporate loans would rise by between 63 and 103 basis points."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5df4\u585e\u5c14\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5212\u4fee\u8ba2\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u8d44\u672c\u5e95\u7ebf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u8d44\u672c\u603b\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u914d\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u672c\u89c4\u5219\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u745e\u58eb\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d44\u672c\u603b\u91cf\u5c06\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u8d37\u6b3e\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "research_question": "\u5df4\u585e\u5c14\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u89c4\u5219\u4fee\u8ba2\u5bf9\u745e\u58eb\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u8d44\u672c\u89c4\u5219\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u94f6\u884c\u8d44\u672c\u603b\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5df4\u585e\u5c14\u534f\u8bae\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u76d1\u7ba1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u745e\u58eb\u5404\u94f6\u884c\u6309\u8d44\u4ea7\u7c7b\u522b\u5212\u5206\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u5bf9\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u4fee\u8ba2\u540e\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8d44\u672c\u603b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u8d37\u6b3e\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u522b\u589e\u52a0142%\u548c130%\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u5dee\u4e0a\u534763\u81f3103\u4e2a\u57fa\u70b9\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d44\u672c\u89c4\u5219\u4fee\u8ba2\u5bf9\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u6559\u8bad\u76f8\u6096\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d44\u672c\u89c4\u5219\u4fee\u8ba2\u5bf9\u745e\u58eb\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

In this paper, we describe an approach to establishing standards and regulations for the technology, developed for a policy report we co-authored on 'Responsible innovation in self-driving vehicles'. This report was requested by the UK Government to support the process that led to the UK's Automated Vehicles (AV) Act 2024. Our approach widens the scope of regulation and standards-setting to aim for high levels of fairness as well as safety. We call our approach 'REAP' (Relational, Equitable, Adaptive and Participatory). We explain how what engineers call a Concept of Operations (ConOps) can be adapted to reflect the REAP approach. From our standpoints in social science and engineering, we outline our reasoning and highlight some of the recommendations made to the UK Government. We consider how this approach could be used to improve the standards that are and will be instrumental in the engineering and regulation of SDVs. Given the immaturity and uncertainties of SDV technologies, our hope is that our recommendations inform good governance, first through the development of goal-based standards and then in the definition of any future prescriptive regulations."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aREAP\uff08\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u6027\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5236\u5b9a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4e0a\u8def\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "REAP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u6027\uff09\u53ca\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6982\u5ff5\uff08ConOps\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51faREAP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6982\u5ff5\uff08ConOps\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5236\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u82f1\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u91c7\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u6cd5\u89c4\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u82f1\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08AV Act 2024\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

By decomposing daily returns into overnight and daytime components, we construct directed networks to capture the lead-lag relations between overnight speculations and daytime price corrections, and vice versa, across stocks. We originate a novel clustering-based framework to construct portfolios to capture the cross-stock tug of war. In order to identify disjoint leader and lagger groups in directed lead-lag networks, we develop a specialized spectral clustering algorithm. By generating trading signals exclusively from the leader stocks to predict and trade lagger stocks, we isolate pure cross-stock interactions from autocorrelation within individual stocks.

As we explain in this note, however, a combination of BCBS 303 rules, supervisory practices and ratings agencies\u2019 views of European deals mean that the positive effect on securitisation activity in Europe is likely to be slight. This is because, under proposed rules, capital for the large majority of European banks\u2019 securitisation positions would be based on a very conservative ratings based approach.</p>\n<p>(BCBS 303 suggests that a top-down purchased-receivables treatment may facilitate broader use of non ratings based approaches.

The overall thrust of his research, and his view of the role of mathematics in the discipline, have so far received little attention. Based on an unprecedented examination of his work and professional archives, this article provides a thorough analysis of Hotelling's background and contribution to economics. A self-taught economist in the 1920s, Hotelling built a research program that, despite apparently being highly technical, was primarily conceived as applied science to solve concrete social and economic issues, from spatial competition to natural resource exhaustion and public utility regulation. Although Hotelling's research was not exempt from criticism, it remains profoundly inspiring for the twenty-first century, from both a theoretical and epistemological point of view. When we remember that he trained the greatest, from Kenneth J.

Recent developments in export imputation for Brazilian municipalities allow for an analysis of the concentration profile of each municipality and its relationship with export openness. Our research makes three major contributions: we develop a novel Export-Intensive Gini Index using Monte Carlo simulations that isolates commodityspecific concentration patterns while controlling for the composition of remaining export portfolios; we apply double machine learning methodology to establish causal relationships while controlling for hundreds of municipal characteristics including geographic, infrastructural, demographic, and institutional factors; we provide the first comprehensive analysis of subnational export concentration patterns in a major developing economy using production-based rather than customs-based trade data. Our results reveal heterogeneity across commodities: coffee exhibits the strongest positive relationship between export openness and concentration, followed by corn, soybeans and sugar, while beef demonstrates negative coefficient. These findings indicate that trade integration affects agricultural specialization differently across commodities, with implications for regional economic vulnerability and policy design. For policymakers, our results suggest that coffee and corn-producing municipalities face increasing exposure to price volatility as they integrate into global markets, requiring targeted risk mitigation strategies. Conversely, the weak relationships for soybeans and beef suggest these sectors may offer more stable foundations for export-oriented development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5df4\u897f\u57ce\u5e02\u51fa\u53e3\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51fa\u53e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u519c\u4ea7\u54c1\u5bf9\u8d38\u6613\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5496\u5561\u548c\u7389\u7c73\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u725b\u8089\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u51fa\u53e3\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5df4\u897f\u57ce\u5e02\u51fa\u53e3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b8c\u5584\u4f7f\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\u51fa\u53e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u8d38\u6613\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d38\u6613\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u51fa\u53e3\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5546\u54c1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff08Export-Intensive Gini Index\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u79cd\u57ce\u5e02\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u54c1\u5bf9\u51fa\u53e3\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u5496\u5561\u548c\u7389\u7c73\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u725b\u8089\u5219\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5927\u8c46\u548c\u7cd6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u800c\u975e\u6d77\u5173\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6b21\u56fd\u5bb6\u51fa\u53e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u519c\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5496\u5561\u548c\u7389\u7c73\u4ea7\u533a\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

It presents a comparative assessment of the extent to which policy statements and debates on climate risk and climate security within these interstate institutions might indicate an emerging dominant discourse on climate security, as well as how these institutions have understood, conceptualised and recognised climate security. This book, which includes scoping interviews with leading climate security experts, examines the literature on epistemic communities, riskification, and securitisation in order to conceptualise three analytical themes as a set of tools relevant for analysing the nuances of climate and security discourses. It applies these themes to the domain of interstate climate security, highlighting important contrasts between the themes while recognising conceptual overlaps and interchange between them.

This is especially true as it relates to the protection of property rights and, ultimately, the role it plays in economic development. This study adds to this literature by considering how lynching activity across US states impacts sovereign credit. Given that lynching tends to be associated with weak public sector institutions, limited-access social orders, and the weak protection of individual and property rights, we posit that as lynchings increase so too will bond yields.

The authors describe the history of the emergence and development of the institute of alternative service in Armenia. Particular attention is paid to the influence of state institutions and religious organisations on the decision to refuse military service on grounds of conscience, as well as to the specifics of the activities of various religious organisations under martial law. The authors reveal the role of the Armenian Apostolic Church as the national church and demonstrate how the freedom of activity of other religious organisations registered in Armenia is ensured. The authors emphasise the significant impact of the decisions of international judicial institutions whose jurisdiction is recognised by Armenia, as well as the conclusions of international human rights organisations on the development of the institute of alternative service in this country.<br><br>Based on Armenia's experience, the authors offer a number of recommendations for Ukraine seeking to improve its national egislation on alternative (non-military) service. Based on the results of a detailed analysis of the peculiarities of the procedure for performing two different forms of alternative service (alternative military service and alternative labour service) in Armenia, the authors show that this approach allows for a more complete consideration of the interests of both the state and citizens who have religious beliefs incompatible with traditional military service.<br><br>The authors conclude that it is possible to amend the legislation of Ukraine on alternative (non-military) service to introduce several types of alternative service for different categories of citizens depending on the specifics of their religious beliefs. This is extremely relevant for Ukraine, given the Russian-Ukrainian war. The institutional expansion of the range of forms for the Motherland\u2019s defence can significantly strengthen the defence capability of the state and at the same time guarantee the exercise of everyone's right to freedom of conscience and religion.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e9a\u7f8e\u5c3c\u4e9a\u66ff\u4ee3\uff08\u975e\u519b\u4e8b\uff09\u670d\u52a1\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u73b0\u884c\u7acb\u6cd5\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56fd\u5bb6\u673a\u6784\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u826f\u5fc3\u62d2\u670d\u5175\u5f79\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e9a\u7f8e\u5c3c\u4e9a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e3a\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u7acb\u6cd5\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e9a\u7f8e\u5c3c\u4e9a\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u7acb\u6cd5\u7684\u542f\u793a\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e9a\u7f8e\u5c3c\u4e9a\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u5728\u4fc4\u4e4c\u6218\u4e89\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdb\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u7acb\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u5236\u5ea6\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u81ea\u7531\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u56fd\u9645\u4eba\u6743\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7acb\u6cd5\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u4e9a\u7f8e\u5c3c\u4e9a\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u5236\u5ea6\u80fd\u591f\u517c\u987e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5229\u76ca\u4e0e\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u81ea\u7531\uff0c\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u5f62\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u56fd\u5bb6\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e92\u52a8\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u7acb\u6cd5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u66ff\u4ee3\u670d\u52a1\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6218\u4e89\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

The result has been high lending spreads and the rejection of many loan applications for SMEs particularly in Eurozone periphery countries.The financing constraints on SMEs could be solved in part by reviving the European SME-loan-backed securitisation market. This would permit banks to increase lending while still meeting Basel III capital requirements.

As a result, although there is a sense of the importance of global value chains (GVCs), these are invisible to the disciplinary gaze. This is not limited to international law; neo-formalist contract law and private international law suffer the same fate. There is for some a turn to 'the global' to understand alterity. In this paper, I argue that understanding the time-spaces created by the practice of contracting can offer important reflection on, amongst other things, what 'the global' is. The paper explores the practice of exercising authority through contractual relations at the level of the individual contract, the chain as a whole, and the use of standardised contractual clauses and model contracts. The article suggests these contractual relations are constitutive not only of spatiality but of territoriality. As such, it is possible to reterritorialize global phenomena, and 'the global', that have until now been understood to have deterritorialized from state or international legal orders."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u975e\u56fd\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u4f53\u7684\u6743\u5a01\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6b63\u7edf\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c2\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u540c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7406\u89e3\u201c\u5168\u7403\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5408\u540c\u5173\u7cfb\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u548c\u9886\u571f\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u540c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7406\u89e3\u201c\u5168\u7403\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u7a7a\u91cd\u6784\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6743\u5a01\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6b63\u7edf\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c2\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u7403\u4ef7\u503c\u94fe\uff08GVCs\uff09\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u91ce\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u3001\u65b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u5408\u540c\u6cd5\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u79c1\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5408\u540c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u9886\u571f\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u4f53\u5408\u540c\u3001\u6574\u4f53\u94fe\u6761\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5408\u540c\u6761\u6b3e\u548c\u6a21\u677f\u5408\u540c\u7684\u6743\u5a01\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "findings": "\u5408\u540c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6784\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u91cd\u6784\u9886\u571f\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u9886\u571f\u5316\u5168\u7403\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u540c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7406\u89e3\u201c\u5168\u7403\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u548c\u5408\u540c\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5168\u7403\u4ef7\u503c\u94fe\u548c\u5408\u540c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The unequal distribution of unpaid care responsibilities significantly limits women's labor force participation, perpetuating gender disparities in employment and economic outcomes. Using the McCall-Mortensen macroeconomic job search framework, this paper models the potential impacts of policy interventions on female labor force participation rates (LFPR). A key contribution of the paper is to derive quantitative estimates via model simulation. We find that formalizing part-time employment contracts and equalizing the time burden of unpaid care work between genders predict a 6-percentage point increase in female LFPR, raising the current rate from 37% to 43%. The findings underscore the critical need for formalizing part-time employment contracts in India. Flexibly implemented part-time employment can empower women to balance labor force participation with domestic caregiving responsibilities, by providing greater control over their working hours. Equalizing the burden of unpaid care would require raising public investment in childcare and eldercare infrastructure, and policies promoting paid parental leave and tax incentives for shared care. Drawing on best practices from the advanced world, the study emphasizes the role of flexibility in enabling women to balance professional and domestic responsibilities."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u65e0\u916c\u7167\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u517c\u804c\u5c31\u4e1a\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ca\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5973\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u5728\u65e0\u916c\u7167\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u517c\u804c\u5c31\u4e1a\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u5bf9\u5370\u5ea6\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65e0\u916c\u7167\u62a4\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u5206\u914d\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5973\u6027\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "McCall-Mortensen\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5f97\u51fa\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "findings": "\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u517c\u804c\u5c31\u4e1a\u5408\u540c\u548c\u6027\u522b\u95f4\u65e0\u916c\u7167\u62a4\u65f6\u95f4\u8d1f\u62c5\u5747\u7b49\u5316\u9884\u8ba1\u53ef\u5c06\u5973\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad86\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff08\u4ece37%\u5347\u81f343%\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u65e0\u916c\u7167\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u517c\u804c\u5c31\u4e1a\u5408\u540c\u548c\u516c\u5171\u6295\u8d44\u7167\u62a4\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u9274\u56fd\u9645\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

The RTS is designed to clarify an important component of the Basel 3 rules for securitisation capital as applied to banks in Europe. The PuRA would be used by banks to calculate inputs to the SEC-IRBA, the most advanced of the hierarchy of approaches that banks are permitted to employ when calculating regulatory capital for securitisation exposures in the banking book.</p>\n<p>To illustrate the implementation of the PuRA, we estimate a set of models based on European Data Warehouse (ED) data for residential mortgages. We estimate models for 8 European countries using loan level data for the pools of 504 Residential Mortgage Backed Security deals. We are able to formulate models at country, originator and deal levels. We examine how data from these different models may be combined to estimate PDs for a single notional deal. We discuss how adjustments may be made for originator underwriting standards and for different Margins of Conservatism. The exercises we perform help us to identify ways in which the EBA\u2019s RTS could be helpfully extended or made more precise.</p>\n<p>We conclude that there are three areas in which the RTS could be clarified. First, the RTS state that the data hierarchy for banks implementing the PuRA is the inverse of what would normally hold for an IRB model implementation in that external data on exposures resembling those of the securitisation pool in question should be preferred to the bank\u2019s internal data on loans that it has originated itself. This implies that PuRA modelling should be considered as the development of a methodology that can be applied to multiple datasets in a dynamic way as securitisation deals present themselves. It would be helpful for the EBA to acknowledge this as it represents a significant departure from the usual IRB modelling practice and has multiple important implications.</p>\n<p>Second, the EBA has provided little guidance in the crucial area of what data is acceptable. A key question is whether aggregate performance data of the sort contained in securitisation market investor reports and used by ratings agencies in risk analysis of securitisations may serve as the basis for analysis or whether loan level data is essential to obtain supervisory approval. This study employs loan level data but we are aware that ratings agencies often analyse securitisations on the basis of cumulative default curves broken down by vintage.</p>\n<p>Third, the EBA\u2019s 2017 guidelines on IRB modelling require banks implementing IRB models to develop Margins of Conservatism and to allow for the impact of underwriting standards. While significant in other IRB exercises, these two requirements are central to PuRA modelling involving as it does multiple data sources used in a varied and dynamic way. Making all aspects of these activities fully statistical and data driven (without judgmental input) appears scarcely feasible.

Using large panel data in Japan and an event-study design that accounts for staggered treatment timing, I find sizable and persistent employment penalties for females after childbirth. Mothers' employment decreases by 36 percentage points one year after childbirth and stays lower five years later by approximately 19 percentage points. These effects vary by job characteristics, contract type, and co-residence status, highlighting substantial heterogeneity. In contrast, eldercare has smaller, at most 5 percentage points, and often statistically insignificant average effects on employment. However, eldercare penalties are larger and statistically significant, reaching up to 10 percentage points, for females with certain pre-event characteristics: those in low-teleworkability jobs, those in high physical proximity jobs, those on non-regular contracts, and those employed in small firms."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u7167\u62a4\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u80b2\u513f\u548c\u517b\u8001\uff09\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5973\u6027\u5728\u751f\u80b2\u540e\u5c31\u4e1a\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u517b\u8001\u7167\u62a4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e14\u56e0\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7167\u62a4\uff08\u80b2\u513f\u548c\u517b\u8001\uff09\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bb6\u5ead\u7167\u62a4\u5bf9\u5c31\u4e1a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4ea4\u9519\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "findings": "\u751f\u80b2\u5bfc\u81f4\u5973\u6027\u5c31\u4e1a\u7387\u4e00\u5e74\u540e\u4e0b\u964d36\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4e94\u5e74\u540e\u4ecd\u4f4e19\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u517b\u8001\u7167\u62a4\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff08\u6700\u591a5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u4f4e\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u5408\u540c\u7b49\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff08\u8fbe10\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u7167\u62a4\u5bf9\u5c31\u4e1a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6027\u522b\u4e0e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb6\u5ead\u7167\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This paper develops statistical methods for forecasting AUM and applies them to data for 2,494 UK, French, German and Italian-domiciled funds. The results allow one to project forward AUM under different assumptions about market conditions and in a way that is customised for the age, size and fund flow and return histories of the funds in question.</p>\n<p>Building on an extensive academic literature, we employ an approach that splits the dynamics of AUM into the contributions of returns and of fund flow (defined as the change in AUM less the effects of returns). We use statistical methods to model these two components separately and then combine the models to generate forecasts of AUM itself.</p>\n<p>The effects implied by our estimates are broadly intuitive (in a qualitative sense) for the four domiciles of funds that we analyse. Lagged fund flow and lagged returns imply higher (percentage) growth as does being a young or a small fund. However, the (quantitative) sensitivities of fund flow to different effects and, in particular to lagged returns and lagged fund flow, are much greater for UK funds than for those from other domiciles we consider. Italian funds are least sensitive in this regard.

We also analyse capital from a bottom up perspective, allocating Solvency II capital for asset pools to securitisation tranches using the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA) employed in the Basel III rules.

While the GloBE rules operate as a \"common approach\" without a binding multilateral convention, their uncoordinated application and interpretation across jurisdictions are highly likely to generate significant tax controversies and double taxation. The OECD acknowledges this, yet concrete guidance on dispute resolution remains elusive. The paper classifies potential GloBE disputes into \"internal\" (e.g., conflicts over GloBE income calculation or UTPR allocation) and \"external\" (e.g., clashes with existing tax treaty principles like the arm's length principle). It analyzes various proposals for dispute resolution, focusing on the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) under bilateral tax treaties. While MAP offers a familiar framework, its limitations include incomplete treaty networks, the absence of legislative MAP clauses in many treaties, and its inherent opaqueness, which hinders dispute prevention. Alternative approaches, such as domestic law mechanisms based on reciprocity (as seen in Italy) and a dedicated multilateral convention for GloBE MAP, are also explored. While a dedicated dispute resolution mechanism in a multilateral convention is deemed preferable for its comprehensive scope and potential for transparency, its political feasibility remains a significant hurdle. The paper concludes that without a cogent and legally authoritative dispute resolution mechanism, the \"coordinated unilateralism\" of the GloBE regime may struggle to deliver the necessary legal certainty for taxpayers amidst inevitable cross-border tax controversies."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86OECD\u5168\u7403\u6700\u4f4e\u7a0e\u89c4\u5219\uff08Pillar Two\uff09\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u6548\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u8fb9\u516c\u7ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u60f3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728OECD\u5168\u7403\u6700\u4f4e\u7a0e\u89c4\u5219\uff08Pillar Two\uff09\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7a0e\u6536\u4e89\u8bae\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u5f81\u7a0e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eGloBE\u89c4\u5219\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u516c\u7ea6\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53f8\u6cd5\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\u7684\u65e0\u534f\u8c03\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a0e\u6536\u4e89\u8bae\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u5f81\u7a0e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fd\u9645\u7a0e\u6536\u6cd5\u548c\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8GloBE\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5185\u90e8\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u8fb9\u7a0e\u6536\u534f\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u534f\u5546\u7a0b\u5e8fMAP\uff09\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "findings": "\u73b0\u6709MAP\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u8fb9\u516c\u7ea6\u867d\u4e3a\u7406\u60f3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u653f\u6cbb\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3aGloBE\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u8fb9\u516c\u7ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u53ca\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Using a novel news-based measure of community engagement, we find that larger, federally-chartered community banks operating in a single state are more likely to participate in local activities. Engaged banks originate more loans to small businesses and more mortgage loans in their local communities, especially in low-income areas. Using natural disasters as an exogenous shock, we provide evidence that the relation is causal. Furthermore, we find that counties with a larger fraction of engaged community banks experience faster recoveries from natural disasters. Finally, we document that engaged banks have faster deposit growth, lower deposit volatility, better asset quality, and were less likely to experience large deposit withdrawals during the recent regional banking crisis The results suggest that establishing local ties with the community helps banks mitigate information asymmetries that are common in small business lending and can be a way for such banks to mitigate adverse effects of increased competition and maintain an edge in a digital age."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u793e\u533a\u548c\u94f6\u884c\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5927\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u7279\u8bb8\u4e14\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u5dde\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5730\u533a\u53d1\u653e\u66f4\u591a\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d37\u6b3e\u548c\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u751f\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u53bf\u5728\u707e\u540e\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u8fd1\u671f\u533a\u57df\u6027\u94f6\u884c\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "research_question": "\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u8fd9\u79cd\u53c2\u4e0e\u5bf9\u793e\u533a\u548c\u94f6\u884c\u81ea\u8eab\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u672c\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u94f6\u884c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u672c\u5730\u8054\u7cfb\u5e94\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u538b\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u89d2\u8272\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5916\u751f\u51b2\u51fb\uff08\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\uff09\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u751f\u51b2\u51fb\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "1. \u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5927\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u7279\u8bb8\u7684\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u6d3b\u52a8\uff1b2. \u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5730\u533a\u53d1\u653e\u66f4\u591a\u8d37\u6b3e\uff1b3. \u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u53bf\u707e\u540e\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b4. \u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u8054\u7cfb\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u7ade\u4e89\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u793e\u533a\u94f6\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672c\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u5371\u673a\u3002"}}

Using the R 2 decomposed connectedness approach for the period 1/1/2012-1/31/2025, the analysis reveals moderate volatility spillovers, notably amplified by geopolitical conflict more than the health crisis. Key findings identify gold and equities as primary shock emitters, while currency and bonds function as major receivers. Shipping generally displays neutral behavior within the network. Portfolio analysis shows that most sampled assets significantly reduce risk for shipping investors. Conversely, shipping effectively minimizes risk for bitcoin and natural gas portfolios. Significant heterogeneity in hedging effectiveness is documented across distinct crisis episodes. These results underscore the imperative for shipping investors to employ tailored hedging strategies and offer policymakers insight into shipping's contained systemic footprint on contagion dynamics."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6ce2\u7f57\u7684\u6d77\u5e72\u6563\u8d27\u6307\u6570\uff08BDI\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u91d1\u878d\u53ca\u5546\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ec4\u91d1\u548c\u80a1\u7968\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u51b2\u51fb\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u8d27\u5e01\u548c\u503a\u5238\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u3002\u822a\u8fd0\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ec4\u5408\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u51b2\u6548\u679c\u3002", "research_question": "\u6ce2\u7f57\u7684\u6d77\u5e72\u6563\u8d27\u6307\u6570\uff08BDI\uff09\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u53ca\u5546\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u822a\u8fd0\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8d38\u6613\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u5173\u952e\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u8054\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eR2\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e02\u573a\u95f4\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528R2\u5206\u89e3\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u67902012\u5e741\u67081\u65e5\u81f32025\u5e741\u670831\u65e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u9ec4\u91d1\u548c\u80a1\u7968\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u51b2\u51fb\u6e90\uff0c\u8d27\u5e01\u548c\u503a\u5238\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u63a5\u6536\u8005\uff1b\u822a\u8fd0\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ec4\u5408\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u51b2\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u822a\u8fd0\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8054\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u4f20\u67d3\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u822a\u8fd0\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5bf9\u51b2\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u822a\u8fd0\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Furthermore, I test to see if the Discount rate, reserve requirements, and interest on reserves set by the Federal Reserve are effective policy tools for indirectly controlling the money supply.

Rooted in centuries-old cultural traditions and ecological wisdom, their practices emphasize harmony with nature, resource conservation, and community-based governance. This paper explores tribal perspectives on sustainability through an interdisciplinary lens, focusing on traditional ecological practices, community resource management, legal frameworks such as the Forest Rights Act (2006) and PESA (1996), and contemporary challenges including land alienation, climate change, and socio-political marginalization. By examining case studies from tribes like the Dongria Kondh, Apatani, and Baiga, the study highlights successful models of indigenous conservation and resistance. It argues for the integration of tribal knowledge into mainstream policy, education, and environmental planning, and recommends participatory governance mechanisms and support for indigenous livelihoods. The findings underline the urgent need to shift from exploitative development paradigms toward inclusive and ecologically sound frameworks, positioning tribal communities as pivotal agents in India's pursuit of sustainable development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u90e8\u843d\u793e\u533a\u5728\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6d3b\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u667a\u6167\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u4e3b\u6d41\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5370\u5ea6\u90e8\u843d\u793e\u533a\u7684\u751f\u6001\u667a\u6167\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u8df5\u878d\u5165\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u90e8\u843d\u793e\u533a\u62e5\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u751f\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u571f\u5730\u6d41\u5931\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5c06\u5176\u667a\u6167\u7eb3\u5165\u4e3b\u6d41\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u793e\u533a\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u300a\u68ee\u6797\u6743\u5229\u6cd5\u300b\u548cPESA\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5982Dongria Kondh\u3001Apatani\u548cBaiga\u90e8\u843d\uff09\u5206\u6790\u90e8\u843d\u7684\u751f\u6001\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "findings": "\u90e8\u843d\u793e\u533a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7684\u672c\u571f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u652f\u6301\u751f\u8ba1\u5c06\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u571f\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u793e\u533a\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u91c7\u7eb3\u90e8\u843d\u667a\u6167\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u6001\u53cb\u597d\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u6cbb\u7406\u3002"}}

In conjunction with Robinson's (1953) critique of the neoclassical production function, these critiques of the neoclassical theory of capital and interest became known as the Cambridge Capital Controversies. Samuelson (1966) capitulates to the Neo-Ricardian attack, admitting reswitching theoretically refutes the neoclassical theory of capital and defense of capitalist distribution, but New Keynesian economics largely ignores the controversy without providing a satisfactory solution in the eyes of Neo-Ricardian economists. I propose an alternative theory of capital as solution to the reswitching conundrum by recasting interest rates as an expression of time-preference rather than the marginal productivity of capital. I synthesize insights from Robinson, Bliss, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, Kirzner, and Murphy to provide a new foundation for capital theory."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5251\u6865\u8d44\u672c\u4e89\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u518d\u8f6c\u6362\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u5251\u6865\u8d44\u672c\u4e89\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u518d\u8f6c\u6362\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65b0\u53e4\u5178\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u201c\u518d\u8f6c\u6362\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u51ef\u6069\u65af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u672a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6ee1\u610f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408Robinson\u3001Bliss\u3001B\u00f6hm-Bawerk\u3001Kirzner\u548cMurphy\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "findings": "\u5c06\u5229\u7387\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u201c\u518d\u8f6c\u6362\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u65b0\u53e4\u5178\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u5229\u7387\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Drawing on methodologies from environmental economics, particularly categories such as option and existential values, the approach addresses less obvious outcomes of space activities that nonetheless significantly shape public perceptions and judgments of program effectiveness. Current institutional developments in space activities demonstrate the relevance of economic goods and value epistemology as a framework for understanding and designing space policy."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5546\u54c1\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u603b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503cTEV\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u592a\u7a7a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5546\u54c1\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u592a\u7a7a\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u542f\u793a\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5546\u54c1\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u603b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\uff08TEV\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u592a\u7a7a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u592a\u7a7a\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u975e\u663e\u6027\u6210\u679c\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5171\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5224\u65ad\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5546\u54c1\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u603b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\uff08TEV\uff09\u3001\u73af\u5883\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u671f\u6743\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u592a\u7a7a\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u592a\u7a7a\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5546\u54c1\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u79c1\u4eba\u5546\u54c1\u5411\u516c\u5171\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\uff09\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u592a\u7a7a\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5546\u54c1\u548cTEV\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u592a\u7a7a\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The investor only observes the current trades made in the market with his securities to estimate the current return, variance, and risks of his unchanged portfolio. We show how the time series of consecutive trades made in the market with the securities of the portfolio can determine the time series that model the trades with the portfolio as with a single security. That establishes the equal description of the market-based variance of the securities and of the portfolio composed of these securities that account for the fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. We show that Markowitz's (1952) variance describes only the approximation when all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are assumed constant. The market-based variance depends on the coefficient of variation of fluctuations of volumes of trades. To emphasize this dependence and to estimate possible deviation from Markowitz variance, we derive the Taylor series of the market-based variance up to the 2 nd term by the coefficient of variation, taking Markowitz variance as a zero approximation. We consider three limiting cases with low and high fluctuations of the portfolio returns, and with a zero covariance of trade values and volumes and show that the impact of the coefficient of variation of trade volume fluctuations can cause Markowitz's assessment to highly undervalue or overestimate the market-based variance of the portfolio.

Using causal mediation analysis, we compare pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and funded pension structures across 18 advanced economies and individual-level data from 2,241 respondents in 9 European countries. We find that private pension funding enhances well-being by strengthening financial security, while PAYG systems are linked to lower security and reduced well-being-especially in ageing societies where demographic pressures heighten the relevance of pension design.

By systematically writing call options on underlying stock positions, these products generate option premiums that are distributed as income. However, this income comes with structural tradeoffs: upside participation is capped, performance is path dependent, and distributions may include a return of capital (ROC) component that reduces principal over time. This primer offers a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding the mechanics, risk characteristics, and real-world implementations of covered call ETFs, with a focus on their role in diversified portfolios.

Second, RIP extends beyond the commonly reviewed studies on regional innovation systems (RIS) and smart specialization strategies (S3), encompassing other underexplored issues. Third, RIP topics are framed across all three innovation policy paradigms, not just within the innovation systems tradition.

Departing from conventional models that assume either sparse or dense structures ex ante, our approach learns the probability of sparsity in both mispricing (alphas) and factor loadings (betas) directly from the data. Empirically, we find that alphas are considerably sparser than betas, and that sparsity varies systematically with asset complexity, pricing difficulty, and macroeconomic conditions. By allowing model complexity to emerge endogenously, our method yields interpretable, adaptive, and high-performing predictions, offering a principled bridge between sparse selection and dense shrinkage approaches."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u201d\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u5f85\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9884\u5148\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9a\u4ef7\u9519\u8bef\uff08alphas\uff09\u548c\u56e0\u5b50\u8f7d\u8377\uff08betas\uff09\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6982\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0calphas\u6bd4betas\u7a00\u758f\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u4e14\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u968f\u8d44\u4ea7\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6761\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u751f\u5730\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u6536\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u67b6\u8d77\u4e86\u6865\u6881\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9884\u5148\u5047\u8bbe\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u5bc6\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9884\u5148\u5047\u8bbe\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u5bc6\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60alphas\u548cbetas\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6982\u7387\u3002", "findings": "alphas\u6bd4betas\u7a00\u758f\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u4e14\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u968f\u8d44\u4ea7\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6761\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The research highlights how CIN's PPE model balanced government oversight with private innovation under conditions of low technological readiness, geopolitical tension, and systemic uncertainty. The findings reveal that successful PPEs require adaptive governance, inclusive stakeholder coordination, and pragmatic foresight.

This study advances a Scripture-anchored, interdisciplinary framework that reunites scientific inquiry with a Christian worldview and empirically tests its influence on student learning. Methodology: Adopting a qualitative-dominant mixed-methods design, we executed an AI-assisted meta-synthesis of 180 peer-reviewed sources (2019-2025) and triangulated those insights with multi-site case studies of Wheaton College (USA), Daystar University (Kenya), and Redeemer University (Canada). Data-curricula, alumni surveys, and classroom artefacts-underwent thematic coding and cross-case pattern matching, generating testable propositions linking faith-based instruction, epistemic coherence, and learning outcomes. Results: Across contexts, faith-integrated STEM programmes exhibited markedly greater cognitive engagement, deeper ethical reasoning, and heightened spiritual formation than secular comparators. Meta-synthesised effect sizes (Hedges g = 0.35-0.55) show that explicit biblical framing elevates moral-reasoning and purpose metrics, with the most pronounced gains among students previously unfamiliar with faith-learning integration. Key mediators include faculty integration skill, mission-aligned accreditation standards, and culturally attuned pedagogy. Conclusions: Positioning sola Scriptura as the ultimate epistemic authority does not dilute scientific rigour; it re-humanises STEM by welding empirical facts to transcendent purpose. The proposed framework supplies educators, policymakers, and accreditation bodies with a scalable roadmap for producing technically competent, ethically resilient graduates equipped to steward AI, biotechnology, and green-tech frontiers. Future research should deploy longitudinal, multi-institutional designs and neurocognitive measures to further validate the model's causal pathways and global applicability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5723\u7ecf\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0e\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4fe1\u4ef0\u6574\u5408\u7684STEM\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7075\u6027\u5851\u9020\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e16\u4fd7\u9879\u76ee\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5723\u7ecf\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0e\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9STEM\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403STEM\u6539\u9769\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fa7\u91cd\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u9053\u5fb7\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4eba\u751f\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u601d\u8003\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5723\u7ecf\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fe1\u4ef0\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u62ecAI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5143\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u548c\u591a\u5730\u70b9\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u7f8e\u56fd\u3001\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u3001\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u4fe1\u4ef0\u6574\u5408\u7684STEM\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u7075\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u91cf\u663e\u8457\uff08Hedges g = 0.35-0.55\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u4fe1\u4ef0\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u57f9\u517b\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4e14\u9053\u5fb7\u575a\u97e7\u7684\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u3002"}}

Rather than splitting earnings into cash flows and accruals, the overlapping model splits earnings and cash flows into \"overlaps\" (cash transactions included in earnings) and two types of accruals: (1) \"inclusions\" (non-cash transactions included in earnings) and (2) \"exclusions\" (cash transactions excluded from earnings). We demonstrate that the two models may produce contradictory inferences on the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) assertion that earnings are more informative than cash flows about future cash flows.

The existence of a private market for insurance such as contingent capital can eliminate the overinvestment incentives, leading to efficient outcomes. However, it does not eliminate fire sales. A central bank that can infuse liquidity cheaply may be motivated to intervene in the face of fire sales. If so, it can crowd out the private market and, if liquidity intervention is not priced at higher-than-breakeven rates, induce overinvestment. We examine various forms of public intervention to identify the least distortionary ones.

Unlike earlier forms of digital innovation, genAI has the potential to support and possibly take over at least some of the diagnostic and analytical functions performed by human lawyers. It thus adds a new dimension to the debate over how (and how much) AI will be a substitutive technology, displacing humans from knowledge work, and how it might serve to augment and enhance human expertise in performing knowledge roles. At present, however, we have relatively little objective understanding of how it is being used and the scale of its impact on what lawyers in Australia actually do. This paper takes a two-pronged approach to this question. First, we explore the potential and prospective impact of emerging AI technologies through a new taxonomy of four ideal types (archetypes) that seek to capture different, emergent, substitutive and augmentative patterns of AI-enabled legal knowledge work. Secondly, we examine the current impact of genAI on legal work from three perspectives: the limited data on its current deployment in Australia; an analysis of the nature of legal competence, and activity analysis drawing on empirical studies of lawyers' use of time. On the basis of this analysis, we argue that, by virtue of a mix of cultural, economic, and technical constraints, genAI is both unevenly distributed across the legal ecosystem, and currently over-hyped, operating chiefly as a kind of 'digital law clerk', substituting for and augmenting human work on only a limited range of lower level diagnostic tasks. Looking to the future, our analysis indicates that whether genAI and later AI iterations can become more broadly augmentative and transformative of the legal function, will depend on the technology's capacity to move safely through our more complex archetypes, taking on more sophisticated analytical and inferential tasks, and demonstrating a wider range of skills that reflect the more human qualities of lawyering.

In this paper, an evolutionary game theory is constructed to analyze the strategic interactions between city governments regarding the adoption of climate policies, integrating both synergistic and spillover effects across categories. And a structural equation model (SEM) is utilised to elucidate the mediating mechanisms of innovation and green efficiency on the transmission pathways from climate policy to sustainability results. Empirical findings suggest that punitive climate policies, such as environmental taxes or emission charges, are positively associated with improvements in green innovation and green efficiency, thereby advancing sustainable development. If innovation can effectively converts into increased green efficiency, supportive climate policies, such as fiscal incentives and subsidies, are more efficacious in fostering innovation, which can further augment sustainability either directly or indirectly. However, subsidies may lead to rent-seeking behavior or resource misallocation, failing to stimulate innovation and potentially undermining sustainability outcomes. Specifically, in eastern cities or leading cities with higher levels of sustainability, punitive climate policies are more effective at improving green innovation, while supportive policies are better suited to promote general innovation. Conversely, in western or lagging cities, punitive policies may suppress innovation due to limited absorptive capacity, and supportive policies fail to deliver meaningful improvements in green efficiency. These findings underscore the need for context-specific policy design and differentiated adjustments. Furthermore, for cities identified by the early warning system as being at risk of sustainability, climate policies should be promptly recalibrated."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6f14\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u57ce\u5e02\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u60e9\u7f5a\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u7eff\u8272\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u652f\u6301\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u521b\u65b0\u8f6c\u5316\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u57ce\u5e02\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6f14\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff08SEM\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u6f14\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\uff0cSEM\u63ed\u793a\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "\u60e9\u7f5a\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7eff\u8272\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u521b\u65b0\u8f6c\u5316\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u8d44\u6e90\u9519\u914d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u5236\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We introduce DEVISE-the Depth-Aware Vegetation Indexing System-an endto-end pipeline that combines Mask2Former panoptic segmentation, MiDaS monocular depth estimation, and HSV filtering to compute distance-weighted canopy, grass, and understory shares from Google Street View (GSV) images. Applied to 1,441,746 panoramas collected every 20 m along the road networks of 60 U.S. swing counties (2004-2024), DEVISE produces the first county-month panel of street-level greenness spanning two decades. DEVISE improves on prior approaches in three key respects. First, relative to the Panorama-View Green View Index (PVGVI) of Zhang et al. (2023), it replaces a CNN backbone with a transformer, introduces depth weighting, and disaggregates vegetation classes, thereby eliminating far-field bias and reducing color-based false positives. Second, compared with the scalable Green View Index framework of Xia et al. (2021), DEVISE restores semantic precision in cluttered scenes and reduces over-estimation by pairing depth cues with spectral post-processing. Third, unlike the tree-species detector of Choi and Lee (2022), which is accurate but computationally demanding, DEVISE prioritizes longitudinal scalability, processing the national panel in six months of cloud compute while preserving perceptual realism. This study also offers a quantitative demonstration of DEVISE 's capabilities. Regression analyses show that a one-percentage-point increase in the most recent Democratic presidential vote share is linked to a 0.52-0.71 percentage-point gain in depth-adjusted total greenness after controlling for climate and socioeconomic covariates; this association remains robust with county and month fixed effects (R 2 \u2248 0.91-0.99). These findings imply that partisan alignment translates into observable street-level environmental benefits, highlighting the political significance of urban forestry. To facilitate replication and extension, all code, trained weights, and a commandline interface will be released as the open-source devise Python package. By integrating transformer segmentation, depth-aware weighting, and rigorous social science validation, DEVISE establishes a new benchmark for scalable, policy-ready audits of perceptual equity in urban environments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86DEVISE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8857\u9053\u7ea7\u7eff\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5173\u8054\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DEVISE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u8857\u9053\u7ea7\u7eff\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7eff\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8857\u666f\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u884c\u4eba\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7eff\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eMask2Former\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u3001MiDaS\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548cHSV\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u690d\u88ab\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6784\u5efaDEVISE\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Google\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u6811\u51a0\u3001\u8349\u5730\u548c\u4e0b\u5c42\u690d\u88ab\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u751f\u621020\u5e74\u7684\u53bf\u7ea7\u6708\u5ea6\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "DEVISE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u8fdc\u573a\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u989c\u8272\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a\u5f97\u7968\u7387\u4e0e\u7eff\u5316\u7387\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u690d\u88ab\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8857\u9053\u7ea7\u7eff\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "practical_contributions": "DEVISE\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Framed against a backdrop of historical and ongoing caste-based oppression, the analysis posits that these dropouts are not isolated failures but symptoms of pervasive \"social toxicity\" and systemic marginalization that impacts individuals from prenatal stages to posthumous rites. The study aims to critically deconstruct the conventional narrative that attributes these dropouts primarily to financial constraints or individual academic shortcomings, arguing that such explanations are often a \"policy polemic\" that obscures the more profound challenges of caste-based discrimination, social alienation, and a non-inclusive institutional climate. Employing a multifaceted approach, the article synthesizes quantitative data on dropout rates and entrance examination performance with qualitative analysis of case studies, institutional practices, and policy critiques. Key findings reveal that over 13,600 reserved category students dropped out between 2018 and 2023. Analysis of JEE and CAT entrance scores demonstrates that while performance gaps persist, they are often narrower than portrayed and are decreasing, challenging the simplistic narrative of \"lack of merit.\" The paper identifies the primary drivers of attrition as systemic issues, including persistent microaggressions, social and academic isolation, inadequate and culturally insensitive support systems, and institutional apathy. Evidence is drawn from the struggles of faculty from marginalized backgrounds, discriminatory practices such as mess hall segregation, and the stark contrast between these issues and institutional priorities. The article concludes that attributing dropouts to superficial causes allows institutions to evade the necessary work of dismantling systemic barriers. It calls for a paradigm shift from focusing solely on access to ensuring retention through proactive measures, including fostering genuine inclusivity, implementing robust and empathetic support systems, and holding institutional leadership accountable for creating equitable environments where all students can thrive."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u9876\u5c16\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u6765\u81eaSC\u3001ST\u548cOBC\u80cc\u666f\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9ad8\u8f8d\u5b66\u7387\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8f8d\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u6216\u4e2a\u4eba\u5b66\u672f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u5ea6\u9876\u5c16\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e2dSC\u3001ST\u548cOBC\u5b66\u751f\u9ad8\u8f8d\u5b66\u7387\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u8f8d\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5c06\u8f8d\u5b66\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u8d22\u52a1\u6216\u4e2a\u4eba\u5b66\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u59d3\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u8f8d\u5b66\u7387\u548c\u5165\u5b66\u8003\u8bd5\u6210\u7ee9\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u6279\u5224\uff09\u3002", "findings": "2018\u81f32023\u5e74\u95f4\u6709\u8d85\u8fc713,600\u540d\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u5b66\u751f\u8f8d\u5b66\uff1b\u5165\u5b66\u8003\u8bd5\u6210\u7ee9\u5dee\u8ddd\u5728\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6b67\u89c6\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5b64\u7acb\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u8f8d\u5b66\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u4e8e\u8f8d\u5b66\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u547c\u5401\u4ece\u5355\u7eaf\u5173\u6ce8\u5165\u5b66\u673a\u4f1a\u8f6c\u5411\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u751f\u7559\u5b58\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u63aa\u65bd\u5982\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Boko Haram that was formerly known to be a machete yielding group with no arms sophistication now poses as a threat to global security. It has been argued that Boko Haram is now more ruthless compared to AlQaeda terrorist group due to their violent activities like the kidnapping of 276 Chibok girls, the killing of both Christians and Muslims, bombing of the United Nations structure in Abuja, kidnapping and killing of foreigners in Nigeria and have even extended attacks to neighbouring countries like Chad, Cameroun and Niger. An extensive argument has been established on the level of threat that Boko Haram poses to global security. Though some persons see Boko Haram as a regional threat, others regard it as an existential threat to the society particularly global security. In order to foster global security in the international scene, multilateral organisations were created with a collective agreement to aid with global issues and security with organisations like the U.N, however, these organisations have failed to help Nigeria to completely end Boko Haram violent activities in Nigeria. The realism theory helps to explain why idealism has failed to curb out terrorism in the international arena, this is due to the selfish nature of the international system. Boko Haram has adversely impacted Nigeria and global security, the global community ought to come together to end Boko Haram\u2019s violent activities and possibly end terrorism altogether to foster global security."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u535a\u79d1\u5723\u5730\u6050\u6016\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u66b4\u529b\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u56fd\u9645\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u535a\u79d1\u5723\u5730\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u535a\u79d1\u5723\u5730\u7684\u66b4\u529b\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u53ca\u5168\u7403\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6839\u6e90\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u56fd\u9645\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u53cd\u6050\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u535a\u79d1\u5723\u5730\u7684\u66b4\u529b\u6d3b\u52a8\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u535a\u79d1\u5723\u5730\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u904f\u5236\u5176\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56fd\u9645\u53cd\u6050\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u547c\u5401\u5168\u7403\u793e\u4f1a\u52a0\u5f3a\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u5e94\u5bf9\u535a\u79d1\u5723\u5730\u53ca\u6050\u6016\u4e3b\u4e49\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

Green bonds play a crucial role in financing the transition to a carbon-neutral economy, and while the ECB cannot directly finance sustainable projects, its strategy and communication are key tools to influence market expectations. Using an event study combined with Structural Topic Modeling (STM), we examine 40 climate-related ECB announcements between 2019 and 2023. Our results show that green bond returns respond to these announcements, with significant variation in both direction and magnitude. The STM analysis further reveals that Green finance\u00a0and Climate-related risk\u00a0topics are associated with the most pronounced negative abnormal returns, while Sustainable growth\u00a0topics cause modest positive responses. The findings underscore the importance of clear and well-targeted communication to avoid unintended market volatility and support the broader green transition."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u592e\u884c\uff08ECB\uff09\u4e0e\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u5bf9\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u53cd\u5e94\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u6d32\u592e\u884c\u4e0e\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u7684\u56de\u62a5\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u78b3\u4e2d\u6027\u7ecf\u6d4e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u6b27\u6d32\u592e\u884c\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u671f\u95f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\uff08STM\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5e02\u573a\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u4e3b\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\u548cSTM\u5206\u6790\u4e862019\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u95f440\u9879\u6b27\u6d32\u592e\u884c\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u516c\u544a\u3002", "findings": "\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u56de\u62a5\u5bf9\u516c\u544a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u201c\u7eff\u8272\u91d1\u878d\u201d\u548c\u201c\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u201d\u4e3b\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8d1f\u5f02\u5e38\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u800c\u201c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u201d\u4e3b\u9898\u5f15\u53d1\u5c0f\u5e45\u6b63\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u592e\u884c\u6c9f\u901a\u5bf9\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u7eff\u8272\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u592e\u884c\u9700\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6c9f\u901a\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5e02\u573a\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7eff\u8272\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

Sharing origins and often functions and specialists, both concepts have run parallel paths that have merged on multiple occasions. This evolution has been studied from different points of view. Initially, marketing experts included PR techniques as an additional tool to grant it a greater specific instrumental relevance over time. On the other hand, PR scholars have tried to dissociate themselves from marketing in order acquire an independent position within the field of communication. In Spain, these conceptual differences are currently blurred due to the creation of new university degrees and double degrees combining both disciplines. This trend is evidenced within the Spanish university market which, throughout this article, will be compared to other markets, namely the American and the British ones, as a scientific reference for both concepts, and to the Portuguese one, given its geographical proximity. We will reflect on the reasons that have led the Spanish university market to combine both concepts and to offer official studies that include them in their nomenclature, far from the historical tradition in this country, where studies in public relations have been related to the&nbsp;&nbsp;field of communication, while those in marketing have been related to the field of economics. The identification of this trend in the job market of organisational communication professionals poses new challenges to training institutions, especially to universities. <b>Spanish Abstract:</b> Presentamos una reflexi\u00f3n sobre los estudios universitarios espa\u00f1oles que combinan los&nbsp;<span>conceptos de marketing y relaciones p\u00fablicas.

We focus on the case that the DM's risk preference is not completely known and would consider all the distortion functions that meet some criteria, such as preferring certain lotteries over other lotteries and having some confidence intervals for the risks of a list of lotteries when making decision. Under the expectedvalue premium principle, the DM picks the robust insurance indemnity function that minimizes its risk exposure based on the worst-case distortion risk measure. By assuming that the DM's risk preferences have certain curvature, such as being concave or inverse S-shaped, we disentangle the structure of the optimal indemnity function and the worst-case distortion function in an analytical way, and give the tractable reformulations to determine the later when the underlying loss is discretely distributed. Moreover, several extensions to our framework are presented and discussed.

Contrary to conventional economic explanations (e.g., individual income constraints), we argue that formalization is a collective decision: when most street vendors sell in informal markets, formalized market spaces are not a competitive place to sell. Exposure to the effects of climate change, however, can disrupt this equilibrium of persistent labor informality. Unpredictable weather limits informal sellers' ability to protect their goods and sell in the streets, increasing demand for stability, shelter, and coordination with peers. We argue that demand for social capital-trust and coordination with peer sellers-drives labor formalization in response to climate shocks. Evidence from focus groups and a survey experiment with 2,400 street vendors in urban Liberia reveal that labor formalization is (a) a critical form of adaptation to climate change and (b) more appealing when informal vendors view formalized peers as more trustworthy. In particular, informal sellers' perceptions that formalized sellers are \"good citizens\" who follow the law is a strong mechanism that induces formalization. These findings suggest that beyond economic incentives, peer effects and the sociopolitical context of markets play a central role in shaping patterns of labor formalization."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u57ce\u5e02\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u4f1a\u6253\u7834\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u52b3\u52a8\u7684\u5747\u8861\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u52b3\u52a8\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\uff08\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u540c\u884c\u534f\u8c03\uff09\u662f\u52b3\u52a8\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u57ce\u5e02\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff1f\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u52b3\u52a8\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u5982\u4e2a\u4eba\u6536\u5165\u9650\u5236\uff09\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7126\u70b9\u5c0f\u7ec4\u8ba8\u8bba\u548c\u9488\u5bf92400\u540d\u5229\u6bd4\u91cc\u4e9a\u8857\u5934\u644a\u8d29\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "findings": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u63a8\u52a8\u52b3\u52a8\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\uff1b\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u540c\u884c\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u201c\u597d\u516c\u6c11\u201d\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u644a\u8d29\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u540c\u884c\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u540c\u884c\u4fe1\u4efb\u63a8\u52a8\u52b3\u52a8\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In addition to the effects of corruption on economic growth and development, the environmental and distributional consequences of corruption are strong themes in scholars' motivation for studying corruption. Personal background and intellectual curiosity are also important drivers, as is a desire to develop effective anti-corruption initiatives that are informed by careful examination of the costs, beneficiaries, and victims of corruption. We also summarise the other chapters of the book, each of which sets out the theory and evidence linking corruption to the targets and indicators of the Sustainable Development Goal in question. Chapters also note gaps in the existing literature and in many cases offer a critique of the targets and indicators used to define and track progress towards the sustainable development agenda. We conclude by noting some general principles for anti-corruption for sustainable development but note that more research, and funding, is required in many cases to develop and test effective sector specific interventions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8150\u8d25\u7684\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2a\u4eba\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8150\u8d25\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cd\u8150\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u5219\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "research_question": "\u8150\u8d25\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8150\u8d25\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2a\u4eba\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u5174\u8da3\u9a71\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8150\u8d25\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u7ae0\u8282\u603b\u7ed3\u3002", "findings": "\u8150\u8d25\u5bf9\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8150\u8d25\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5173\u8054\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cd\u8150\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Using new data on preferences for an international tax and transfer program in 29 countries, I first show a strong negative correlation across countries between income and preferences for international redistribution.

Conventional approaches often apply market-derived or statistically inferred rates across asset classes that monetize fundamentally different types of scarcity. This practice leads to valuation distortions and undermines the interpretability of intertemporal pricing. We propose that the discount rate c should be benchmarked to an external asset that monetizes a similar form of constraint, such as algorithmic, physical, or legal scarcity. This reframes discounting as an economic judgment rather than a regression output. The framework addresses the circularity of self-referential estimation methods and corrects for category mismatches in valuation. We formalize a scarcityaligned benchmarking principle, derive implications for inter-asset comparability, and illustrate benchmark selection across asset classes including Bitcoin, Ethereum, gold, equities, and derivatives. The result is a coherent, structurally grounded approach to valuation that aligns the logic of discounting with the logic of monetization."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u4ea7\u4f30\u503c\u4e2d\u7684\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u7c7b\u578b\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u8d44\u4ea7\u4f30\u503c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e02\u573a\u6216\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d44\u4ea7\u7c7b\u522b\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u503c\u5931\u771f\u548c\u8de8\u671f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff08Scarcity-Aligned Framework\uff09\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u5e94\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7269\u7406\u6216\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u3001\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u3001\u9ec4\u91d1\u3001\u80a1\u7968\u548c\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u7b49\u8d44\u4ea7\u7c7b\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u591f\u7ea0\u6b63\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06\u8d34\u73b0\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u4ece\u56de\u5f52\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u53c2\u8003\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8d44\u4ea7\u4f30\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u8d44\u4ea7\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u548c\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Non-cooperative harvesters prioritize short-term extraction, overlooking biodiversity's contribution to productivity and allowing extraction to accumulate. In contrast, cooperative regimes internalize ecological values and dynamically adjust harvest effort, resulting in improved ecological and economic outcomes. Cooperative management moderates harvesting intensity, enhances biodiversity, and increases overall welfare compared to non-cooperative approaches. Implementing mechanisms-such as fees, taxes, or regulations-that align private incentives with social values helps decentralize cooperation and buffers outcomes against parameter variability. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that cooperative regimes consistently influence ecological changes and tend to promote more stable long-term dynamics.

The decade we live in now, the year 2025, has brought challenges to education. Digital transformation, artificial intelligence, intelligent technologies, and industrial robotics ensure that learners search for answers with less effort and do not delve deeper into the subject matter. We see a generation with less consistent, structured, and analytical thinkers, as solutions and answers are delivered quickly and easily through technology. The tendency to make things very easy is just around the corner, and the vitality of learning how things are formed fundamentally is at stake.\n</div>\n<div>\n I believe that our societies, especially in our age of technology boom, digital transformation, and increasing artificial intelligence, need more and more systematic and consistent education in all parts of today's world. To a certain extent, digitization, which changes education towards technological reactions and responses, weakens traditional education, but acquires and promotes an advanced education, especially in terms of andragogy (self-learner through teacher or mentor guided) and heutagogy (self-autonomous, independent, and self-determined learner), striving for better and making progress by using the improved existing skills, intellectual capital, and artificial intelligence to obtain knowledge and answers to problems.\n</div>\n<div>\n This statement will focus on classical pedagogy, emphasizing the fundamentals of comprehension processes and the development of knowledge. While learners can easily understand concepts through Artificial Intelligence and other responsive applications, they still need to learn the methods and strategies for conducting research. Educators play a crucial role in providing guidance and mentoring to ensure that knowledge is conveyed systematically and appropriately for their developmental stage. Learners need to understand how artificial intelligence functions and how to conduct systematic research. This includes defining research objectives, applying research methods, and identifying needs and problems without relying solely on pre-programmed applications that may not accurately reflect willingness or conscious thought. These applications are merely tools. Learners must learn to synthesize information and develop creative solutions.\n</div>\n<div>\n Societies are now at the center of the educational frameworks, creating politically affordable and economical offers (decision-making bodies), influencing stakeholders (educational institutions, teachers, learners, and parents) to act as well, quickly, and purposefully as possible, considering what is necessary for their school development and in the public interest.\n</div>\n<div>\n I am enthusiastic and passionate about my desire to continue to be an inspirational and professional educator in business and engineering. I aim to apply my acquired knowledge and experience through the continuity of current teaching and vision methods, and to help the students learn progressively, achieve their goals, and experience their lives through success stories.\n</div>\n<div>\n This statement of pedagogical philosophy is organized on the roles of the actors that factorize education. The roles of education, institutions, educators, and the learners.\n</div>\n<div>\n I hope this paper helps you define your teaching philosophy statement.

Unlike the U.S. market, the Chinese market\u2019s data missingness has received less attention, where differences in data sources, market maturity, and regulations affect data completeness. Using a dataset of 106 firm characteristics from 1992 to 2022, we find that missing data in China follows a \u201ccliff-shaped\u201d pattern, with significant improvements post-2000. We compare two imputation methods, Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Mean Imputation (MN), and evaluate their effects on asset pricing using portfolio analysis and machine learning. Results indicate that, in univariate analysis, both imputation methods have minimal impact on stock return predictions due to high similarity in extreme deciles before and after imputation.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when combining all characteristics in machine learning models, the EM method slightly improves return prediction accuracy compared to MN imputation. This study provides insights into handling missing data in emerging markets and emphasizes the importance of appropriate imputation methods for machine learning-based asset pricing.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u80a1\u5e02\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u8d22\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u516c\u53f8\u5c42\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u5448\u73b0\u201c\u60ac\u5d16\u5f0f\u201d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c2000\u5e74\u540e\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08EM\u548cMN\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0EM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u80a1\u5e02\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u8d22\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u80a1\u5e02\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u5e02\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6570\u636e\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08EM\u548cMN\uff09\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281992\u5e74\u81f32022\u5e74\u7684106\u4e2a\u516c\u53f8\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83EM\u548cMN\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u6790\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u5448\u73b0\u201c\u60ac\u5d16\u5f0f\u201d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c2000\u5e74\u540e\u6539\u5584\uff1bEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528EM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using Bitcoin's return as a hurdle rate for equities, real estate, or decentralized finance protocols introduces a misalignment between risk structure and valuation logic. We formalize this critique through five illustrative cases of discount rate misapplication and propose an alternative: scarcity-aligned discounting.

Employing an interdisciplinary approach that combines economic analysis and legal review, the study examines whether farmers' resistance is rooted in actual economic threats or driven by status quo bias-a psychological preference for the familiar, even when change brings measurable gains. By analysing trade flows, subsidy structures, and the legal safeguards embedded in EU trade agreements, the paper shows that Polish agriculture has maintained strong export performance and positive trade balances, while protective mechanisms mitigate potential competition risks. The findings suggest that perceived threats and cognitive biases play a greater role than material disadvantages. The study concludes that understanding this paradox is crucial for designing policies that balance rural political preferences with the EU's strategic goals for trade liberalisation and sustainability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6ce2\u5170\u519c\u6c11\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u8d38\u6613\u534f\u5b9a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u5bf9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u6b27\u6d32\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u548c\u5171\u540c\u519c\u4e1a\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u76ca\u8005\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u519c\u6c11\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u66f4\u591a\u6e90\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u9645\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "research_question": "\u6ce2\u5170\u519c\u6c11\u4e3a\u4f55\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u8d38\u6613\u534f\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u76ca\u8005\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u519c\u6c11\u53cd\u5bf9\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u519c\u6751\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u6b27\u76df\u6218\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u73b0\u72b6\u504f\u89c1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8d38\u6613\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u8865\u8d34\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6b27\u76df\u8d38\u6613\u534f\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "findings": "\u6ce2\u5170\u519c\u4e1a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u8d38\u6613\u987a\u5dee\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u519c\u6c11\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u66f4\u591a\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fc3\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u519c\u6c11\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e73\u8861\u519c\u6751\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u6b27\u76df\u8d38\u6613\u81ea\u7531\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We propose a monetary policy framework in which the central bank accounts for de-anchoring risks using a regime-switching model. First, we derive the optimal monetary policy strategy, which balances the trade-off between the welfare costs of a stronger response to inflation and the benefits of preserving the central bank\u2019s credibility. Next, we apply this framework in a medium-scale regime-switching DSGE model and develop a method to assess de-anchoring risks in real time. Using the post-COVID inflation episode in the euro area as a case study, we find that an explicit \u201dlooking-through\u201d strategy would have only modestly increased de-anchoring risks.

Grounded in behavioral finance theory and enriched by empirical data from a quantitative survey of 210 respondents, the research examines emotional responses across four investor types: manual, automated, hybrid, and non-investors. A key contribution of this study is its nuanced disaggregation of emotional triggers and their effects on decision-making, combined with a comparative analysis of emotional discipline between users and non-users of automated tools. The findings demonstrate that while traditional emotional biases like loss aversion and risk aversion play a lesser role than previously assumed, overconfidence, familiarity bias, and herd behavior remain prominent. Importantly, the study shows that automated tools effectively reduce susceptibility to impulsive or emotionally driven investment behaviors, enhance long-term orientation, and promote strategy adherence. By integrating psychological and technological dimensions of investing, this investigation contributes to the literature on behavioral and digital finance and provides empirical support for the potential of automation in improving financial decision quality.

There have been significant international institutional climate change policy drivers to harness a global effort to reduce adverse anthropogenic (humaninduced) effects on the climate system. Following the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and then the Paris Agreement (2015) many countries have adopted carbon pricing policies with various mechanisms that in combination had achieved coverage of some 28 per cent. of global carbon emissions by 2025 according to the World Bank. There are both mandatory and voluntary carbon markets that are effectively specialised human-construct commodity markets. Carbon pricing has encouraged structured financial engineering based on measured carbon emissions in different jurisdictions. Further research will be necessary to assess whether the progress in carbon pricing and carbon markets is sufficiently effective in achieving positive outcomes at national and global levels. Governments may face increasing pressure to consider the balance between carbon pricing policies and promotion of carbon management technologies especially if the latter prove to be more effective and/or acceptable to businesses and the wider public.

In the special case of exponential utility function and normality of stock returns, we show that, if options are fairly priced, investors are indifferent to call overwriting. However, even a small option overpricing makes call overwriting optimal whatever the magnitude of equity premium. This conclusion is no more valid when we depart from normality assumption adopting a more realistic distribution of stock returns. In the typical case when downside volatility exceeds the upside one, the investor demands a certain minimum implied volatility premium for call overwriting, which we derive analytically. Using actual bid prices of at-themoney call options on S&amp;P 500 index, we find that current levels of implied volatility premium are not high enough to justify call overwriting unless one has bearish-to-neutral view on equities."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u6307\u6570\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u80a1\u7968\u6536\u76ca\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u82e5\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u4f46\u5373\u4f7f\u671f\u6743\u8f7b\u5fae\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u80a1\u7968\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79bb\u6b63\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u518d\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u5728\u5178\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u884c\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\u4e8e\u4e0a\u884c\u6ce2\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u8981\u6c42\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u6ea2\u4ef7\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e00\u6ea2\u4ef7\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u6ea2\u4ef7\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u80a1\u5e02\u6301\u4e2d\u6027\u6216\u770b\u8dcc\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u80a1\u7968\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u80a1\u7968\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u6b63\u6001\u4e0e\u975e\u6b63\u6001\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff08\u6307\u6570\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\u3001\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff08S&P 500\u6307\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u671f\u6743\u6570\u636e\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u5728\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u80a1\u7968\u6536\u76ca\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u671f\u6743\u9ad8\u4f30\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u975e\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u9700\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u6ea2\u4ef7\u652f\u6301\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6ea2\u4ef7\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u671f\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u6ea2\u4ef7\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5728\u671f\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

Rather than predicting returns directly, FA-SOP decomposes them into three components-dividend-price ratio, earnings growth, and price-earnings multiple growth (gm)-and models each separately. We emphasize that gm is a more promising target for forecasting due to its stronger connection with macroeconomic conditions and greater variability over time. FA-SOP forecasts gm using latent macroeconomic factors extracted from high-dimensional data, capturing the underlying state of the economy while avoiding overfitting. Applied to S&amp;P 500 returns from 1960 to 2022, FA-SOP outperforms predictive regressions, factor-augmented regressions, and traditional decomposition approaches, yielding robust out-of-sample gains in both statistical and economic terms. Simulations based on a present-value model further show that FA-SOP's advantage stems from its ability to track the true data-generating process more closely.

This study examines the Egypt Green Hydrogen project-a multinational strategic alliance in an emerging market-to analyze how such collaborations align strategic objectives, governance structures, and national development agendas. Using Chandler's Strategy-Structure Paradigm and institutional theory, the research employs a qualitative case study approach, drawing on secondary data from corporate reports, policy documents, and academic literature. The findings reveal that the consortium, comprising Scatec ASA, Fertiglobe, Orascom Construction, and Egyptian public entities (the Sovereign Fund of Egypt and EETC), leverages complementary capabilities: renewable energy expertise, ammonia production, local infrastructure development, and policy alignment. The alliance's governance structure, characterized by defined roles, majority-minority equity participation, and hybrid public-private oversight, effectively balances commercial agility with national priorities under Egypt Vision 2030. Key outcomes include technology transfer, risk mitigation through joint financing models (e.g., DFI-backed concessional loans), and contributions to sustainable energy transition, economic diversification, and foreign direct investment (FDI) attraction. The study underscores the critical role of public-sector anchoring in legitimizing projects and aligning them with institutional frameworks, while private partners drive innovation and scalability. Derived actionable recommendations-including structured public-private governance models, de-risking frameworks, and localized capacity-building strategies-are proposed to guide policymakers and firms in designing scalable green hydrogen alliances. By demonstrating how strategic-structural alignment fosters sustainable industrialization, the Egypt Green Hydrogen project offers a replicable model for emerging markets seeking to harness green hydrogen's potential.

The study used an online survey to compare perspectives on campus and social media expressions. Findings reveal that, generally, academic staff showed stronger support for political freedom of expression, while students favoured more restrictive approaches. Both groups supported harsher responses to pro-Hamas compared to pro-Israeli statements, with students showing stronger preferences. Students also perceived controversial statements on social media as more deserving of harsh responses than equivalent campus statements. The study utilised social identity theory to interpret how professional roles and group identities shaped attitudes towards controversial political expressions during the war. The findings highlight the complex dynamics of balancing free speech with security concerns in academia during wartime, underscoring the need for nuanced policies that consider varied stakeholder perspectives and the role of social media."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86570\u540d\u72b9\u592a\u88d4\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u57282023-2025\u5e74\u4ee5\u54c8\u6218\u4e89\u671f\u95f4\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u66f4\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7531\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u800c\u5b66\u751f\u503e\u5411\u9650\u5236\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4eb2\u54c8\u9a6c\u65af\u8a00\u8bba\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u4e25\u5389\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u4ee5\u8272\u5217-\u54c8\u9a6c\u65af\u6218\u4e89\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u72b9\u592a\u88d4\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u6709\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6218\u65f6\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u5e73\u8861\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u540c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u804c\u4e1a\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u653f\u6cbb\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6821\u56ed\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u8a00\u8bba\u6001\u5ea6\u3002", "findings": "\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u66f4\u652f\u6301\u653f\u6cbb\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u503e\u5411\u9650\u5236\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\uff1b\u4e24\u8005\u5bf9\u4eb2\u54c8\u9a6c\u65af\u8a00\u8bba\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u4e25\u5389\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6001\u5ea6\u66f4\u5f3a\u786c\uff1b\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8a00\u8bba\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e94\u53d7\u4e25\u5389\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u540c\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6218\u65f6\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u6001\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u804c\u4e1a\u8eab\u4efd\u5bf9\u6001\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6218\u65f6\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u5236\u5b9a\u517c\u987e\u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6027\u3002"}}

The ULCRA imposed ceilings on landholdings and restricted land transfers, potentially leading to land misallocation and hindering creative destruction. We find that the repeal of the ULCRA reduced land misallocation by allowing previously more productive firms to increase their land use by 17%. As a result, treated firms expanded their production capacity and became more productive. The liberalization also influenced firm dynamics. Following the repeal, treated firms exhibited a 15% increase in product turnover, introducing more new products and phasing out old ones. Moreover, the liberalization improved firm selection by facilitating the exit of unprofitable firms and attracting more innovative entrants.

We hypothesize that women are more likely to apologize than men, conditional on having the same ability. Apologies could be seen as a signal of incompetence, which might hold women back in the labor market. We first provide evidence for the gender apology gap and explore confidence as a reason behind it. We find that while the gender confidence gap plays a role, it cannot fully explain the apology gap. Regarding the labor market consequences of the gender apology gap, we show that employers infer lower ability from workers' apologies and do not take gender differences into account when making ability inferences.

We characterize the optimal designs as non-degenerate deductible-cap policies: costs above a strictly positive deductible are fully reimbursed up to a finite cap. As a corollary, offering no subsidy is never optimal. When negative subsidies (i.e., entry fees) are allowed, optimal transfer policies maintain a simple structure while cream-skimming low-cost agents. We show how parameters of the optimal policies are shaped by whether agents benefit from or are harmed by additional participants. The former case of strategic complementarity is illustrated through selling with one-and two-sided network externalities; the latter case of strategic substitutability through Cournot competition, Tullock contests, and auctions.

The measures in BCBS 424 introduce two major innovations. First, they revised the Risk Weights for credit risk exposures under the Standardised Approach (SA) and, second they impose floors on the capital of Internal Ratings Based (IRB) banks based on SA capital calculations. The Committee's objective in implementing these changes has been to reduce the influence of internal models that advanced banks use to calculate capital and to change the relative capital burden across regulatory exposure classes. The impact of the changes is less transparent than that of some earlier post-crisis rule changes (such as changes in target ratios of the introduction of a leverage ratio).

Using a sample of 27 European Union Member States from 2000 to 2021, we find that welldesigned national fiscal targets positively correlate with overall compliance with the SGP's numerical fiscal rules. However, the interaction between these domestic targets and supranational rules negatively affects compliance.

We propose a new framework to standardise corporate carbon intensity benchmarks that remains statistically robust, disclosure-resilient, and aligned with net-zero transition pathways. The three-step approach derives firm-specific baseline intensities from an EEIO database (Exiobase), imputes missing emissions via a variance-preserving, revenue-weighted estimator, and calibrates the distribution to sectoral decarbonisation targets from the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI). Applied to ~3,000 MSCI ACWI firms, the resulting benchmark distribution is nearly normal-reducing skewness from ~8.7 to 0.44 and kurtosis from ~100 to 0.87. A cross-validation test for non-disclosing firms reveals a 30%+ improvement in estimation accuracy compared to common vendor approaches. The standardised benchmark retains sector and regional granularity, clearly distinguishing decarbonisation leaders from laggards, and remains stable even when disclosure rates vary.

While prior research highlights the influence of CEO media appearances on market perceptions, their role in managing reactions to earnings surprises \u2013 especially negative ones \u2013 remains underexplored. Analyzing 1,869 earnings announcements (2023\u20132024), we find that the probability of a CEO holding an interview rises with the magnitude of the earnings surprises, particularly negative ones. These interviews help mitigate short-term stock price declines but correlate with weaker future firm performance. Notably, interviews that closely echo earnings conference calls (ECCs) improve returns more than those introducing new information as measured by our approach involving large language models and topic modelling. CEOs also tailor their messaging by focusing on external and global topics after negative surprises, while highlighting firm-specific information after positive surprises. This pattern aligns with strategic expectation management and attribution tendencies.

To do this requires that they devise an approach to estimating PDs for securitisation pool loans in a way that satisfies regulators. Given pool PD estimates, they can calculate Basel on-balance sheet capital for the securitisation pool, the key input to the SEC-IRBA.</p>\n<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) has recently published Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) clarifying how banks may implement the SEC-IRBA using an approach that already appears in the Basel framework and in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) which translates Basel rules into European law. This approached, termed the Purchased Receivables Approach or PuRA allows banks to employ proxy data and to apply a \u201cretail standards\u201d approach even when loans are corporate.</p>\n<p>In this note, we implement a \u201cTop Down\u201d PD estimation approach for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan included in the securitisation pools of a single bank, Caixabank. \u201cTop Down\u201d is the term used in the Basel documents which corresponds to what in the CRR is labelled \u201cretail standards\u201d. The approach consists of calculating PDs for loans buckets into different categories. When banks implement this approach, categories are typically defined based on indicators such as region, vintage, bank internal rating and loan product type.</p>\n<p>We compare the results of the Top Down estimation with an alternative that uses pool performance data. Performance data records what fraction of a loan pool fall into categories based on whether they are performing or are in different ranges of number of days in arrears. Such data are widely available because they are commonly included in securitisation investor reports and are often emphasised in ratings agency evaluations of pool credit quality. It is not clear from the EBA\u2019s RTS on PuRA whether regulators will approve banks\u2019 use of performance data in the estimation of PDs for SEC-IRBA implementation.

Using a dynamic panel of 56 countries from 1985 to 2015, we estimate the impact of escape clauses on both domestic bank credit and sovereign bond spreads during crises. Our results show that escape clauses significantly soften the contraction in credit and reduce sovereign borrowing costs when crises occur. In contrast, discretionary fiscal deviations-those not supported by legal clauses-fail to produce similar benefits. These findings suggest that institutionalized fiscal flexibility plays a stabilizing role in periods of financial distress by supporting market confidence and access to finance.

As such, they seek new materials, configurations, and other design elements to meet this objective. This paper compares the cost, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of using clad or solid stainless steel versus using traditional epoxy-coated traditional steel for reinforcing bridge decks. For each material, it is assumed that all other structural elements in the bridge superstructure and substructure are reinforced with traditional steel. The evaluation methodology incorporates multiple criteria such as the initial and life-cycle costs borne by the agency and the users, and the service life of the bridge deck. Then a rank matrix comparison framework was established to identify the best material based on the multiple criteria. The results show that using stainless steel as reinforcement material for the bridge deck can lead to significantly higher initial costs but drastically reduced costs over the bridge life cycle. The reduced costs are a result of less frequent and intense rehabilitation. In harsher environments where bridges are more vulnerable to corrosion, the relative benefits of stainless steel are expected to be even higher. Recognizing that the evaluation parameters are not deterministic, sensitivity analysis of the decision outcome was carried out using ranges of values for traffic volume, material prices, discount rates, life-cycle profiles, and user cost percentages. The results of this paper suggest the superior long-term costeffectiveness of stainless steel as a reinforcement material for highway bridge decks, compared to traditional (epoxy-coated traditional) steel."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5728\u6865\u9762\u677f\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u5c42\u6216\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u73af\u6c27\u6d82\u5c42\u94a2\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u867d\u7136\u521d\u59cb\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u6865\u9762\u677f\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u73af\u6c27\u6d82\u5c42\u94a2\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u54ea\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6865\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u4e14\u7ef4\u4fee\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6210\u672c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6210\u672c\u5206\u6790\u3001\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u521d\u59cb\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6210\u672c\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u5bff\u547d\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6392\u540d\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "findings": "\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u521d\u59cb\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7ef4\u4fee\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6865\u9762\u677f\u6750\u6599\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6865\u9762\u677f\u52a0\u56fa\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u671f\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

To address this, we study how accounting software adoption by private firms responds to labor market conditions. We first show that adoption is increasing in accounting wages and decreasing in the number of accountants in a given market. We confirm this finding in a Bartik-style estimation that exploits the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and differences in states' pre-Act exposure to public company accounting labor markets.

The trend analysis indicates that oil prices and government investment on infrastructure exhibit concurrent fluctuations. The impulse response indicated that the effect of crude oil price shocks is significant in the near term yet maintains constant and increases in the long term, suggesting that the influence of crude fluctuations in oil prices may last into the future.

It argues that conventional approaches to innovation have been shaped by Eurocentric epistemologies and colonial legacies, often marginalizing or rendering invisible the diverse innovation pathways rooted in non-Western, indigenous, and grassroots knowledge systems. Drawing on postcolonial theory, critical race studies, and the sociology of knowledge, the article outlines the theoretical and methodological foundations of Innovationology, which is built upon the principles of epistemic decolonization and cognitive justice. Through in-depth case studies from the Global South, the article demonstrates how Innovationology can catalyze the recognition and valorization of pluriversal innovation epistemologies, fostering more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable innovation ecosystems. The article concludes by mapping out a research and action agenda for the institutionalization of Innovationology within academic, policy, and practitioner domains, as a means of driving transformative change in the field of innovation studies and praxis."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u521b\u65b0\u5b66\uff08Innovationology\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53bb\u6b96\u6c11\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u521b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4e49\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u975e\u897f\u65b9\u3001\u571f\u8457\u548c\u57fa\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u6b96\u6c11\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u521b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u7eb3\u5165\u975e\u897f\u65b9\u548c\u571f\u8457\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u521b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u6b27\u6d32\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u6b96\u6c11\u5386\u53f2\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u5143\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53bb\u6b96\u6c11\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u540e\u6b96\u6c11\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6279\u5224\u79cd\u65cf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u5168\u7403\u5357\u65b9\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "findings": "\u521b\u65b0\u5b66\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u5143\u521b\u65b0\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5305\u5bb9\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u521b\u65b0\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53bb\u6b96\u6c11\u5316\u521b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u884c\u52a8\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u521b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u3002"}}

To explain this divergence, this study argues that internal authority structures condition the trade-off between these capacities. Distinguishing between routine tasks and pressure-induced tasks such as tax extraction, the analysis shows that decentralized configurations allow local officials to engage in rent-seeking and reduce the mobilization costs of campaign-style enforcement. In contrast, political centralization enhances discipline but weakens incentives, increasing the organizational burden of implementing top-down directives. Drawing on a unique panel of actual tax ratios and fiscal planning data, the study demonstrates that prefectural responses to provincial deterrence varied sharply across periods of decentralization and centralization; in provinces with stricter disciplinary enforcement, deterrent signals became increasingly ineffective. These findings reveal a structural tension between extraction and discipline, offering new insights into power-sharing dynamics in non-electoral regimes."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d22\u653f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5b98\u50da\u7eaa\u5f8b\u901a\u5e38\u540c\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u56fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53cd\u4f8b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5206\u6743\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\uff0c\u5730\u65b9\u5b98\u5458\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfb\u79df\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u52a8\u5458\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u653f\u6cbb\u96c6\u6743\u867d\u589e\u5f3a\u7eaa\u5f8b\u4f46\u524a\u5f31\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0e\u6536\u6bd4\u7387\u548c\u8d22\u653f\u89c4\u5212\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7701\u7ea7\u5a01\u6151\u6548\u679c\u5728\u5206\u6743\u4e0e\u96c6\u6743\u65f6\u671f\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u8d22\u653f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5b98\u50da\u7eaa\u5f8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff1f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u56fd\u5728\u8d22\u653f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5b98\u50da\u7eaa\u5f8b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u56fd\u5bb6\u80fd\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5206\u6743\u4e0e\u96c6\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7a0e\u6536\u6bd4\u7387\u548c\u8d22\u653f\u89c4\u5212\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9762\u677f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6743\u4e0e\u96c6\u6743\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u7701\u7ea7\u5a01\u6151\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u5206\u6743\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u5730\u65b9\u5b98\u5458\u66f4\u6613\u5bfb\u79df\uff0c\u96c6\u6743\u867d\u589e\u5f3a\u7eaa\u5f8b\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u6fc0\u52b1\uff1b\u7701\u7ea7\u5a01\u6151\u6548\u679c\u5728\u96c6\u6743\u65f6\u671f\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d22\u653f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5b98\u50da\u7eaa\u5f8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u9009\u4e3e\u653f\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u529b\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5728\u5206\u6743\u4e0e\u96c6\u6743\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u56fd\u5bb6\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u8bbe\u3002"}}

This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the key principles, frameworks, and case studies of frugal innovation in Africa, exploring its transformative potential in driving inclusive development and sustainable progress. Drawing on extensive research and illustrative examples, the article examines the defining characteristics of frugal innovation, such as affordability, functionality, sustainability, and adaptability, which distinguish it from traditional innovation models. The article delves into the theoretical foundations that underpin frugal innovation, including the Jugaad Innovation framework, the Empathic Design approach, the Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) framework, the Reverse Innovation concept, and the Frugal Innovation framework. These conceptual models provide valuable insights into the drivers, manifestations, and applications of frugal innovation in Africa. Through a detailed examination of sectoral case studies, the article showcases the diverse ways in which frugal innovations are addressing pressing social, economic, and environmental challenges in areas such as healthcare, energy, agriculture, water, and sanitation. These case studies illustrate the ingenuity, resourcefulness, and community-driven nature of frugal innovation, highlighting its potential to create affordable, accessible, and adaptable solutions that empower marginalized populations. The article further explores the barriers and enablers of frugal innovation, drawing on the insights of prominent African scholars, such as Mvemba Phezo Dizolele and Carlos Lopes. It examines critical issues, including policy and regulatory frameworks, financing mechanisms, innovation ecosystem development, and capacity-building efforts. It outlines strategies for fostering enabling environments that nurture the growth and scaling of frugal innovations. Finally, the article delves into the challenges and approaches to measuring the impact and scaling of frugal innovations, emphasizing the need for comprehensive impact metrics, data-driven decision-making, and the alignment of frugal innovation initiatives with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

We determine the form of the firm equity function with respect to the buyout extent. We obtain a closed-form solution for the optimal proportion of pension liabilities to be transferred to the insurance company. We find that a necessary condition for a buyout to be conducted is that the no-buyout return rate is higher than the buyout return rate, the counterintuitive nature of this condition being related to the negative sign of an involved variable. If additionally, the difference in these two return rates is strong enough, or the horizon is long enough, a decision to conduct a buyout is made. Overall, our results contradict the literature's finding that only healthy sponsors decide to de-risk. Also, we find that the effect of the pension plan relative size on the probability to conduct an annuity buyout can be positive, negative, or non-monotone, contrary to the view of the literature that this effect is positive. In general, the model shows that the most frequent decision is no buyout, and that the decision to conduct a partial buyout is almost never optimal. Thus, the paper's understanding is that, in the majority of cases, partial buyouts can be considered as advisable only if they constitute one of the steps in the de-risking process, with full buyout as the final objective."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\uff08\u5e74\u91d1\u4e70\u65ad\uff09\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e70\u65ad\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u672a\u4e70\u65ad\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e70\u65ad\u56de\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u51b3\u7b56\u901a\u5e38\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4e0d\u4e70\u65ad\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u4e70\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u90e8\u5206\u4e70\u65ad\u3002", "research_question": "\u9a71\u52a8\u5e74\u91d1\u4e70\u65ad\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u6743\u76ca\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u8d1f\u503a\u8f6c\u79fb\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "findings": "\u4e70\u65ad\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u672a\u4e70\u65ad\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e70\u65ad\u56de\u62a5\u7387\uff1b\u51b3\u7b56\u901a\u5e38\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4e0d\u4e70\u65ad\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u4e70\u65ad\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u4e70\u65ad\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u8d5e\u52a9\u5546\u624d\u9009\u62e9\u53bb\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u8ba1\u5212\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u4e70\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u90e8\u5206\u4e70\u65ad\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u4e70\u65ad\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

We find wide variation in sentiment across commenter types, industries, and geographic locations, with investor groups and Democratic-leaning states showing more support. Our results support the rulemaking process's input legitimacy but raise concerns about throughput legitimacy, as politically connected stakeholders exhibit greater influence. Additional analyses reveal that market reactions to the rule differ by industry and often diverge from public sentiment. Comparisons with comment letters submitted to the ISSB suggest less polarization outside the U.S. toward climate disclosure.

It challenges traditional corporate governance models by introducing an integrated framework that centres around the long-term flourishing of people, the resilience of the planet, and the dignity of posterity. Drawing from behavioural economics, regenerative design, intergenerational ethics, and post-growth theory, this study advocates for financial architectures that are not only efficient but emotionally intelligent, morally grounded, and structurally inclusive. Empathy, in this context, is not a sentiment but a strategic modality for embedding ethical foresight into fiscal frameworks. Governance with empathy is proposed as a principle for redesigning decision-making power, risk valuation, and institutional responsibility. The paper culminates in a call for a new form of financial stewardship: one that listens forward, acts equitably, and builds systems capable of bearing the weight of both justice and joy across generations."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u6218\u7565\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u518d\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4ee3\u9645\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u540e\u589e\u957f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91d1\u878d\u6cbb\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u7c7b\u957f\u671f\u7e41\u8363\u3001\u5730\u7403\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u540e\u4ee3\u5c0a\u4e25\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u5730\u7403\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u76ca\u6df1\u8fdc\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53d8\u9769\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u518d\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4ee3\u9645\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u540e\u589e\u957f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u6743\u529b\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u673a\u6784\u8d23\u4efb\u3002", "findings": "\u6218\u7565\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u4f26\u7406\u524d\u77bb\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5305\u5bb9\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6218\u7565\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7406\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u6b63\u4e49\u548c\u8de8\u4ee3\u798f\u7949\u3002"}}

These great revolutions throughout history have always been triggered by the combination of new production, communication and energy technologies, and the material basis of a new world order has emerged. Over time, this material transformation has also affected symbolic and mental structures, including beliefs, values, attitudes, ways of thinking and ideologies. In this sense, revolutionary transformations constitute a multi-layered, structural rupture. Today, we are confronted with a new form of this historical threshold. After the transition from the Agricultural Age, which is defined as \"World 1.0\", to the Industrial Age, which is \"World 2.0\", in the Digital Age, which we define as \"World 3.0\", disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, synthetic biology do not only affect economic processes; It radically transforms the structure of the state, the function of democratic institutions, social norms, environmental sustainability and the individual's perception of reality. * The precariat , or precary, is a class of workers defined in the 20th century. Mainly; It is the class that does business in the labor markets with limited-contract, part-time, project-based contracts. The main factor in the definition is that it is seen as a class that works in jobs that do not have permanent job security and continuity."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u9769\u547d\u6027\u53d8\u9769\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u5851\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\uff08World 3.0\uff09\u4e2d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u9769\u547d\u6027\u53d8\u9769\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u5851\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\uff1f\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9769\u547d\u6027\u53d8\u9769\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u98a0\u8986\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u9769\u547d\u6027\u53d8\u9769\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "findings": "\u9769\u547d\u6027\u53d8\u9769\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u5851\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u6c11\u4e3b\u5236\u5ea6\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u73b0\u5b9e\u611f\u77e5\u4ea7\u751f\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9769\u547d\u6027\u53d8\u9769\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This study examines how policy domains\u2014specifically immigration and redistribution\u2014interact with territorial identities to structure support for the European Union (EU). We develop a theoretical framework that compares individual-level utilities of EU membership with the counterfactual scenario of exiting the supranational union. Our argument emphasizes the role of discrepancies between national and EU-level policies, and introduces a novel account of how regional, national, and European attachments shape opinions on the goodness of the EU. Using cross-sectional survey data from a broad sample of EU member states, we find that pro-immigration attitudes robustly predict support for continued EU membership, while preferences for redistribution exert a more modest influence. Importantly, territorial identities emerge as powerful predictors: individuals with strong regional identification, particularly when paired with anti-immigration views, are significantly more likely to express eurosceptic attitudes. These findings highlight the increasing importance of cultural and identity-based cleavages in shaping public support for European integration, pointing to a shift away from purely economic explanations.\n</div>\n<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u516c\u4f17\u610f\u89c1\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u653f\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u79fb\u6c11\u548c\u518d\u5206\u914d\uff09\u4e0e\u9886\u571f\u8eab\u4efd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79fb\u6c11\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u5f3a\u70c8\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u518d\u5206\u914d\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u9886\u571f\u8eab\u4efd\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f3a\u70c8\u5730\u533a\u8ba4\u540c\u4e0e\u53cd\u79fb\u6c11\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u7684\u6000\u7591\u6001\u5ea6\u3002", "research_question": "\u653f\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff08\u79fb\u6c11\u548c\u518d\u5206\u914d\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u9886\u571f\u8eab\u4efd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u6b27\u6d32\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u5316\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2a\u4eba\u4ece\u6b27\u76df\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u9000\u51fa\u6b27\u76df\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e0e\u6b27\u76df\u653f\u7b56\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u9886\u571f\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6b27\u76df\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u7684\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u652f\u6301\u79fb\u6c11\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u5f3a\u70c8\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u518d\u5206\u914d\u504f\u597d\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b\u5f3a\u70c8\u5730\u533a\u8ba4\u540c\u4e0e\u53cd\u79fb\u6c11\u89c2\u70b9\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u7684\u6000\u7591\u6001\u5ea6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9886\u571f\u8eab\u4efd\u5728\u5851\u9020\u6b27\u6d32\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u516c\u4f17\u610f\u89c1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u5316\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u6b27\u76df\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

For instance, company earnings are typically reported as a dollar figure alongside categorizations, such as whether earnings beat or missed market expectations. We study the hypothesis that when a decision is harder, people rely more on easier-to-process signals: people still discriminate between coarse categories but distinguish less granularly within them, creating higher sensitivity around category thresholds but lower sensitivity elsewhere. Using stock market reactions to earnings announcements, we document that hard-to-value stocks are associated with a more pronounced S-shaped response pattern around category thresholds. Experiments that exogenously manipulate the problem difficulty provide supporting causal evidence in individual investor behavior. We then exploit variation in investor familiarity with earnings surprises of different sizes to show that returns exhibit greater sensitivity in regions with more historical density."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51b3\u7b56\u8d8a\u96be\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u8d8a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6613\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u9608\u503c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u533a\u5206\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "research_question": "\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5b9a\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65b0\u95fb\u6545\u4e8b\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5b9a\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u76c8\u5229\u516c\u544a\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u96be\u4ee5\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u9608\u503c\u9644\u8fd1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u7684S\u5f62\u53cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

The most critical area is in the area of pensions. In just about every country, the defined benefit (DB) is being replaced with a defined contribution (DC) scheme where the risk and the decisions are being laid at the feet of the individual investor. This poses an interesting challenge as most individuals are not financially sophisticated and will struggle to make the right decisions to ensure an ideal retirement outcome. There are other goals that are also placed at the feet of financially unsophisticated individuals from retirement health, saving for a home to saving to a child\u2019s college education. This new trend, called \"Goals-based Investing\" or GBI has a number of challenges to overcome, because effective goal achievement will not be possible without new financial instruments and methods. This book seeks to address this challenge by focusing on new instruments that would greatly simplify this problem and then simple investment approaches that do not require high fees or expensive advisors to achieve a range of goals.

Yet existing research has paid limited attention to how the fiscal value of such connections evolves following formal institutional reforms. In China, informal state-business coalitions-often described as local growth coalitions-have long underpinned sub-national development. This article examines how the tax bureau merger reform disrupted these coalitions by altering the fiscal returns to political connections. Leveraging a difference-indifference in differences (DDD) design and panel data on Chinese listed firms from 2012 to 2021, the study finds that the reform significantly reduced the tax advantages enjoyed by politically connected firms previously supervised by local tax bureaus. Supplementary evidence from a regression discontinuity design and year-by-year propensity score matching further illustrates the shifting administrative foundations and long-term decline in the fiscal value of political connections. While this shift may promote greater transparency and curb rent-seeking, it also introduces institutional uncertainty by dismantling informal channels that previously compensated for weak formal governance."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u7a0e\u52a1\u673a\u6784\u5408\u5e76\u6539\u9769\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u7684\u8d22\u653f\u56de\u62a5\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u65b9\u589e\u957f\u8054\u76df\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6539\u9769\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7531\u5730\u65b9\u7a0e\u52a1\u5c40\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u7a0e\u6536\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "research_question": "\u7a0e\u52a1\u673a\u6784\u5408\u5e76\u6539\u9769\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u8d22\u653f\u4f18\u52bf\uff1f", "motivation": "\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u5728\u4ea7\u6743\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u653f\u4f01\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u6b63\u5f0f\u5236\u5ea6\u6539\u9769\u540e\u7684\u8d22\u653f\u4ef7\u503c\u6f14\u53d8\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5730\u65b9\u589e\u957f\u8054\u76df\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4e0e\u8d22\u653f\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff08DDD\uff09\u548c\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff082012-2021\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u65ad\u70b9\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9010\u5e74\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u3002", "findings": "\u6539\u9769\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7531\u5730\u65b9\u7a0e\u52a1\u5c40\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u7a0e\u6536\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u8d22\u653f\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b63\u5f0f\u5236\u5ea6\u6539\u9769\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u8054\u8d22\u653f\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5730\u65b9\u589e\u957f\u8054\u76df\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5236\u5ea6\u6539\u9769\u5bf9\u653f\u4f01\u5173\u7cfb\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

As a result, corporate behavior reflects a derivative representation of public utility, mediated through the politician's utility function.&nbsp;\n<div>\n At equilibrium, firms select a bundle of societal and private contributions that equate the marginal return to each, weighted by the politician's corruption index and the relative cost to the firm. This endogenizes social welfare in the firm's optimization problem and provides a utilitytheoretic rationale for CSR expenditures. The model thus formalizes how lobbying-like mechanisms can yield socially beneficial outcomes, and under certain conditions, ESG spending emerges as a derivative of the CSR preferences adopted by government.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5171\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u975eGAAP\u652f\u51fa\uff08\u5982ESG\u548cDEI\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9884\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u6548\u7528\u7684\u884d\u751f\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u653f\u6cbb\u5bb6\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "research_question": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u975eGAAP\u652f\u51fa\uff08\u5982ESG\u548cDEI\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u975eGAAP\u652f\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u5316\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6548\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52a8\u6001\u5171\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u5bb6\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6b63\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "findings": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u79c1\u4eba\u8d21\u732e\u7ec4\u5408\u4f1a\u5e73\u8861\u8fb9\u9645\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u653f\u6cbb\u5bb6\u7684\u8150\u8d25\u6307\u6570\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3aCSR\u652f\u51fa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6548\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u6e38\u8bf4\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86ESG\u652f\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u653f\u5e9cCSR\u504f\u597d\u7684\u884d\u751f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While some recent literature has addressed the selection bias, there are no studies that address both problems. Our paper contributes to the study of the effect of exchange rate volatility on international trade by applying the recent model of firm selection to control for both biases. We find that effect of exchange rate volatility on trade that appears to be weak under the standard gravity model or those that only correct for sample selection bias, emerges as a strong negative effect as the two biases get controlled."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u4f01\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bf9\u8d38\u6613\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "research_question": "\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\uff1f\u4f20\u7edf\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u95ee\u9898\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u4f01\u4e1a\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u95ee\u9898", "findings": "\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bf9\u8d38\u6613\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u540e\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bf9\u8d38\u6613\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This review includes the most recent papers discussing the impact of AI tools, including ChatGPT and other technologies, in the educational landscape. It explores the benefits of AI integration, such as personalized learning and increased efficiency, highlighting how these technologies contribute to the learning experiences of individual student needs and administrative processes to enhance educational delivery. Adaptive learning systems and intelligent tutoring systems are also reviewed. Nevertheless, it is known that important responsibilities and ethical considerations intrinsic to the deployment of AI technologies must be included in such an integration. Therefore, a critical analysis of AI's ethical considerations and potential misuse in education is also carried out in the present chapter. By presenting real-world case studies of successful AI integration, the chapter offers evidence of AI's potential to positively transform educational outcomes while cautioning against adoption without addressing these ethical considerations. Furthermore, this chapter's novelty relates to exploring emerging trends and predictions in the fields of AI and education. This study shows that, based on the success cases, it is possible to benefit from the positive impacts of AI while implementing protection against detrimental outcomes for the users. The chapter is significantly relevant, as it provides the stakeholders, users, and policymakers with a deeper understanding of the role of AI in contemporary education as a technology that aligns with educational values and the needs of society."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u6210\u679c\u7684\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982ChatGPT\uff09\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6539\u5584\u6559\u80b2\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9\u5176\u4f26\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u4f26\u7406\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "AI\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u80b2\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86AI\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u6574\u5408\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f26\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86AI\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

This externality is internalized in the collusive equilibrium. When the financial impact of triggering regulation is sufficiently large, the collusive outcome yields lower prices (and higher welfare) than the non-cooperative Bertrand-Nash outcome. Collusive behavior is efficient under these conditions because it facilitates a type of self-regulation that yields lower prices and reduces the likelihood that costly regulatory regimes will have to be implemented."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76d1\u7ba1\u5a01\u80c1\uff08\u76d1\u7ba1\u53ef\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u65bd\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u663e\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u81ea\u5f8b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e02\u573a\u7eaa\u5f8b\u3002\u5728\u53cc\u5be1\u5934\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u76d1\u7ba1\u53ef\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u53cc\u65b9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u56e0\u63d0\u4ef7\u800c\u89e6\u53d1\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u5728\u5408\u8c0b\u5747\u8861\u4e2d\u88ab\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u3002\u5f53\u89e6\u53d1\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u5408\u8c0b\u7ed3\u679c\u6bd4\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4f2f\u7279\u5170-\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u798f\u5229\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u76d1\u7ba1\u53ef\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53cc\u5be1\u5934\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u798f\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76d1\u7ba1\u5a01\u80c1\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e02\u573a\u81ea\u5f8b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4ef7\u683c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u798f\u5229\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7ba1\u53ef\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u548c\u53cc\u5be1\u5934\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5408\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5408\u8c0b\u5747\u8861\u4e0e\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u4f2f\u7279\u5170-\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u5f53\u89e6\u53d1\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u5408\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u5747\u8861\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u798f\u5229\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u53ef\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4e0b\u5408\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u81ea\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7ba1\u5a01\u80c1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e02\u573a\u81ea\u5f8b\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To implement these incentives, we used a cardscanning technology that tracks biowaste sorting in real time. To interpret our findings, we introduced a theoretical model that formalizes prosocial decision-making in contexts where cheating can occur. The model reveals how the removal of incentives creates an opportunity to isolate the roles played by the extrinsic motivation to recycle or cheat in this context, thus making it possible to identify the effect of incentives on intrinsic motivation. On the basis of an evaluation of the effects of incentives over a long-time horizon, we observe that they initially increased recycling; however, this effect declined over time even when the incentives remained in place. Ultimately, the effect vanished after approximately 50 weeks. Crucially, we observe no discontinuity following the removal of incentives. In light of the theoretical model used in this research and several robustness checks, we interpret this pattern as evidence indicating that incentives did not influence extrinsic motivation-either to recycle or to cheat-but rather crowded in intrinsic motivation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=1,579\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6fc0\u52b1\u63aa\u65bd\u5bf9\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5783\u573e\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u63aa\u65bd\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u589e\u52a0\u56de\u6536\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5f71\u54cd\u5916\u5728\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "research_question": "\u6fc0\u52b1\u63aa\u65bd\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5783\u573e\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u548c\u5916\u5728\u52a8\u673a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6fc0\u52b1\u63aa\u65bd\u5bf9\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u5f0a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5361\u7247\u626b\u63cf\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u751f\u7269\u5783\u573e\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "\u6fc0\u52b1\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u589e\u52a0\u56de\u6536\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u6fc0\u52b1\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6fc0\u52b1\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u201c\u6324\u5165\u6548\u5e94\u201d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5916\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u73af\u4fdd\u6fc0\u52b1\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u957f\u671f\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Dedicated CSR and business ethics reports are published by corporations annually and committed ESG funds are one of the fastest-growing funds in recent times. Business ethics stands as a major component of marketing and a differentiating factor in today\u2019s competitive market. However, in a capitalistic society, businesses work on the principle of profit and shareholder maximization, often conflicting with the interests of all other stakeholders, which includes the employees, consumers, and the society at large. The fact is that businesses are not created to benefit the society, but only the owners.&nbsp; \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Hence, the question arises, have businesses adhered to the ethical principles or is it just a deception? The paper \u201cBusiness Ethics: An Oxymoron?\u201d, provides an extensive analysis of CSR and ESG, and examines the rhetoric of business ethics.

In an era of chronic and acute disruptions, durable financial stability will require not just accounting for financial hazards but also engaging in promoting a structural transition. Given the weaknesses of the current approach to financial regulation and oversight, changes in institutional and financial structure should be considered that would reduce the use of \u201crunnable\u201d short-term debt, create more transparency and better incentives for all players, and hence lessen the need for complicated rules, explicit and implicit State guarantees, and interventions in markets. With time running out and the world approaching critical ecological thresholds, central banks and financial regulators will have to integrate environmental considerations into their operations and policies and collaborate more closely with other government agencies.

Unlike standard geopolitical risk indices, \u0394\u00b2PRI isolates events that represent exogenous shifts in diplomatic relationships. Using quantile IV-local projections, the paper studies the causal and asymmetric impact of these shocks on global oil prices. An improvement in US\u2013China relations reduces oil prices by 0.2% in the short run and raises them by 0.3% in the medium run, with effects varying across the oil price distribution. The extension to the Japan\u2013China dyad supports external validity.

These differences persist after controlling for individual wallet-level characteristics such as trading volume, profitability, and collateral use. Agents anticipating Powell's removal also anticipate higher long-term Treasury yields, concordant with concerns about reduced policy credibility and long-run inflation risk as pointed to by the literature on the time inconsistency of optimal policy. These findings suggest that political events shape expectations about future monetary policy, in this case through perceived threats to central bank independence."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573aPolymarket\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u4e3b\u5e2d\u88ab\u89e3\u804c\u7684\u9884\u671f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u653f\u6cbb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7\u5a01\u80c1\u592e\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5851\u9020\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u3002", "research_question": "\u653f\u6cbb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5a01\u80c1\u592e\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u9884\u671f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u653f\u6cbb\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u592e\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u53ca\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u901a\u80c0\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Polymarket\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u9e70\u6d3e-\u9e3d\u6d3e\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u8054\u5176\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u3002", "findings": "\u9884\u671f\u7279\u6717\u666e\u89e3\u804c\u9c8d\u5a01\u5c14\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6301\u66f4\u9e3d\u6d3e\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u77ed\u671f\u5229\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u56fd\u503a\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7\u592e\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This selective approach significantly reshapes the digital asset landscape, altering competitive dynamics and demand patterns. Bitcoin, once the leader in the cryptocurrency movement, is now \"politically orphaned\" in the American regulatory discourse, reflecting a policy preference for \"useful, tame, and trackable\" digital assets aligned with federal oversight and payment modernization goals. This paper investigates how the legislative emphasis on stablecoins over Bitcoin affects Bitcoin's demand as a payment vehicle, enhances the competitive standing of smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana, and explores the long-term implications for innovation and market structure within the U.S. digital asset sector. The regulatory pivot highlights a fundamental reorientation of policymakers' views on digital assets' role in the American financial system, favoring controllable and dollar-pegged stablecoins that bridge traditional finance and digital assets. Bitcoin's exclusion stems from its decentralized and censorship-resistant nature, which conflicts with traditional regulatory frameworks and makes integration into regulated payment systems challenging. This shift may solidify Bitcoin's role as a store of value, while stablecoins and smart contract platforms gain prominence in payments and programmable applications due to their regulatory alignment and technological versatility."}, "AI": {"tldr": "2025\u5e74\u901a\u8fc7\u7684GENIUS\u6cd5\u6848\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u91cd\u5851\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "research_question": "GENIUS\u6cd5\u6848\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u504f\u597d\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4f5c\u4e3a\u652f\u4ed8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u53d8\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5730\u4f4d\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u76d1\u7ba1\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u53ca\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cd5\u6848\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u683c\u5c40\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u56e0\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7279\u6027\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u5728\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u5916\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5de9\u56fa\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff1b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5e73\u53f0\u56e0\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u652f\u4ed8\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5d1b\u8d77\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u76d1\u7ba1\u504f\u597d\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This research evaluates the large-scale LED retrofitting of street lighting in Mesa, AZ, which started in 2019 and is anticipated to be completed by 2026. By using eight years of incident-level data and a staggered difference-in-differences model, it assesses its impacts on public safety. Evidence indicates a decrease in crime, driven by a decline in theft and low-level offenses, with no detectable changes in violent crimes. The effects concentrated on the street segment of the intervention, with limited spatial displacement. Residential, commercial, and industrial zones seem to be affected differently by the LED lighting. An increase in foot traffic may have contributed to the changes in crime.

Employing a dual-methodological approach that combines interdisciplinary expertise with an integrative literature review, the chapter explores how AI technologies are reshaping student identity, emotional regulation, motivation, autonomy, and interpersonal relationships. Drawing on developmental psychology, educational theory, and empirical research, it interrogates the unintended consequences of algorithmic surveillance, pedagogical automation, and AI-mediated social interactions. The analysis highlights both the affordances and risks of AI in education, including its impact on emotional resilience, self-directed learning, and the construction of academic identity. Reframing the discourse away from purely technical efficiency toward developmental integrity makes visible the deeper human stakes of AI integration in education.

After graduating in 1942, he received a fellowship to study in the United States. He initially spent time in Chicago before moving to Harvard, where he attended Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s lectures from 1948 to 1950. During this period, Sylos Labini read Schumpeter\u2019s <em>Business Cycles</em> and decided to record his impressions, which he later shared with his former professor in February 1949. Schumpeter discussed these notes during a couple of his lectures. Though still unpublished, Sylos Labini gave me a copy during our first meeting in 2002, expressing his belief that the time had come to make them public. This paper analyzes the content of those unpublished notes, with a particular focus on the critical observations Sylos Labini made regarding Schumpeter\u2019s theory of business cycles.

This paper proposes economist Hyman Minsky's financial stability hypothesis as a more sophisticated framework for digital asset regulation, one that analyzes assets based on their cash-flow characteristics and systemic-risk profiles rather than their technological features or promotional language. The current \"regulation by enforcement\" approach by the SEC has drawn criticism for lacking clarity, and while the CLARITY Act attempts to delineate oversight between the SEC and CFTC, its binary system fails to differentiate between varied digital assets like fully backed stablecoins and speculative meme coins. This technological divergence leads to fundamentally different risk profiles that current securities laws, developed in the 1930s, struggle to address.

This phenomenon, largely catalyzed by the accessibility of digital trading platforms, represents a significant stride in financial inclusion. However, this report posits that the very mechanisms driving this inclusion-specifically, the gamification of trading applications-present a profound challenge to investor welfare. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the intersection between behavioral economics, gamified user interface design, and the evolving regulatory framework in India. It establishes a theoretical foundation grounded in Prospect Theory and a taxonomy of cognitive biases to deconstruct how platform design leverages predictable human irrationality. Through a comparative analysis of platform design philosophies and case studies, including instances of catastrophic investor loss and examples of responsible design, the research demonstrates how gamified elements can amplify risk-taking by reframing investing as a competitive game. This trend has culminated in the proliferation of \"dark patterns\"-manipulative design choices that prioritize platform engagement over investor protection. The paper critically examines the regulatory response from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), tracing its strategic evolution from issuing behavioral warnings to implementing direct infrastructural interventions, such as restricting real-time data feeds to fantasy trading platforms. The central finding is that while gamification has been a powerful engine for market democratization, it simultaneously creates a high-risk environment for the burgeoning class of novice investors. The report concludes that safeguarding the future of Indian retail investing requires a multi-stakeholder commitment to a new paradigm of responsible financial innovation, where ethical design and investor education are paramount."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5370\u5ea6\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u56e0\u6570\u5b57\u4ea4\u6613\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u8fce\u6765\u96f6\u552e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea4\u6613\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u201c\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u201d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u798f\u5229\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u653e\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u591a\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "research_question": "\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u4ea4\u6613\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5370\u5ea6\u96f6\u552e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u798f\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u63a8\u52a8\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u589e\u52a0\u6295\u8d44\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u524d\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u54f2\u5b66\u4e0e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u635f\u5931\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6848\u4f8b\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6295\u8d44\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6e38\u620f\u653e\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u76d1\u7ba1\u9700\u4ece\u8b66\u544a\u8f6c\u5411\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u547c\u5401\u591a\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f26\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper examines the effects of sanctions through the lens of a stylized model and the empirical analysis of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s exports to Russia in the aftermath of Western measures imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. As sanctions force many exporters to discontinue or reduce their sales in the target country, firms responding to profit opportunities in that market face (i) a rise in the risk of nonpayment, (ii) higher costs of established trading practice, such as making payments in international currencies through international circuits and (iii) reputational risks and the threat of punitive measures, if their trading with the sanctioned country is exposed. We show that, in response to Western sanctions, Turkish firms sharply raised their exports to Russia, charging higher markups and prices, but also increased their reliance on cash-in-advance transactions and invoicing in Turkish liras instead of dollars. In contrast, Turkish affiliates of Western MNCs responded significantly less, if at all, suggesting a desire to avoid reputational costs. For these firms, a back-of-the-envelope calculation points to annualized foregone revenues of $50 million, with a reputational-risk effect equivalent to tariffs of up to 376%."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u897f\u65b9\u5bf9\u4fc4\u5236\u88c1\u540e\u571f\u8033\u5176\u5bf9\u4fc4\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u571f\u8033\u5176\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u4ed8\u4ea4\u6613\u589e\u52a0\u51fa\u53e3\uff0c\u800c\u897f\u65b9\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u5219\u56e0\u58f0\u8a89\u98ce\u9669\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "research_question": "\u897f\u65b9\u5bf9\u4fc4\u5236\u88c1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u571f\u8033\u5176\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u4fc4\u51fa\u53e3\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u88c2\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5236\u88c1\u5bf9\u51fa\u53e3\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5236\u88c1\u5bf9\u51fa\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff08\u4ee5\u571f\u8033\u5176\u5bf9\u4fc4\u51fa\u53e3\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u571f\u8033\u5176\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u4ed8\u4ea4\u6613\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u4fc4\u51fa\u53e3\uff0c\u800c\u897f\u65b9\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u56e0\u58f0\u8a89\u98ce\u9669\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5236\u88c1\u4e0b\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u5236\u88c1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8c03\u6574\u8d38\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

We analyse equilibrium dynamics when social preferences exert a positive externality in green consumption, creating complementarity between policy and preferences.

The specific objectives were: to determine types of risks commonly found in DUWASA and TANESCO, to examine coping strategies taken by DUWASA and TANESCO to manage risk and to determine how risk management practices contribute to organizational performance in DUWASA and TANESCO. The study employed a cross-sectional design, covering 40 respondents drawn from 20 DUWASA and 20 TANESCO respondents. When confirming the normal distribution of answers and the validity and reliability of the tool, a descriptive analysis is conducted between the variables investigated. Data were analyzed using descriptive and multiple response analysis using IBM-SPSS 20. This study has also shown that most public institutions recognize risk management practices for improving organizational performance. It is recommended by the researcher that public institutions should take cost-effective measures to identify risks promptly and effectively measures to mitigate risks continuously to ensure that they are still able to remain in a changing work environment. However, the researchers recommended that future research collect more data on the effect of risk management practices in improving organizational performance among public institutions in Tanzania. The study model has been developed from various sources to develop and increase awareness of public institutions on the importance of risk management practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u529e\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ee9\u6548\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u53ef\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u63aa\u65bd\u53ca\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u7f13\u89e3\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "research_question": "\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u529e\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ee9\u6548\uff1f", "motivation": "\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u7ee9\u6548\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bf940\u540d\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u53ef\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u529e\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5728\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Proper use of organic and inorganic fertilizers enhances soil fertility, boosts plant growth, and supports long-term soil health. Organic manures like farmyard manure, compost, and oil cakes contribute to soil structure and microbial activity, while inorganic fertilizers provide immediate nutrient availability. Nutrient requirements vary between annual and perennial crops, with timing and method of application playing a critical role in nutrient uptake.

We set up a two-region, multi-sector model with production networks, sticky prices and wages, and trade in consumption, investment, and intermediate goods.

In contrast, tariffs on intermediate inputs lead to larger GDP losses, given the limited substitutability of foreign inputs and their role in global supply chains. Moreover, inflation persistence is lower under tariffs on final goods, whereas tariffs on intermediate goods amplify cost pressures through production linkages.

In such contexts, ensuring an efficient and equitable public transportation system is essential to reduce inequalities, broaden access, and support sustainable urban development. The city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, characterized by its geographical diversity and complex mobility demands, exemplifies these challenges. This study explores metro users\u2019 perceptions of service quality, particularly how the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped expectations regarding safety and trust in public transportation. The central hypothesis is that satisfaction and the importance attributed to service attributes vary significantly across sociodemographic profiles such as age, gender, income, and frequency of use. A structured questionnaire was applied to 473 metro users, assessing satisfaction and perceived importance across nine service attributes: fare, safety, information, cleanliness, speed, operating hours, punctuality, comfort, and proximity. Data were collected through QR codes in stations and analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by K-means clustering. The results reveal that mobility experiences are shaped by the interaction of various factors rather than a single attribute. Four distinct user profiles emerged, each with differing priorities and satisfaction levels.

The theory begins with the axiom that all entities seek to sustain their existence, defining this drive as their&nbsp;<i>a priori</i>&nbsp;morality. It establishes a model where social systems are composed of subsystems (individuals) and supersystems (societies), each with a corresponding moral domain (IMD and SMD). The theory posits that the perceived moral domain (eSMD) always lags behind the actual, expanding or contracting SMD, creating a dynamic space for what is defined as \"immorality.\"&nbsp;<span>By analogizing systemic change to a logistic growth curve, the theory maps distinct historical phases\u2014identified as Communism (stasis), Capitalism (growth), and Socialism (decline)\u2014to the mathematical relationship between the actual (SMD) and perceived (eSMD) moral domains. It argues that Marx was correct about the sequence of these phases but not their content, which is determined by the underlying infrastructure and the SMD/IMD ratio (the Morality Multiplier). The theory re-interprets modern phenomena, proposing that the post-1971 credit era is an analogue for socialism and that neoliberalism functions as a high-ratio analogue for primitive communism. Ultimately, the Morality Multiplier offers a new lens for analyzing historical cycles and predicting future systemic shifts, including the potential impacts of artificial intelligence and transhumanism on social morality.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9053\u5fb7\u4e58\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ef4\u6301\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8d85\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9053\u5fb7\u57df\u6ede\u540e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5386\u53f2\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u5171\u4ea7\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u9053\u5fb7\u4e58\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8d85\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u57df\uff08IMD\u548cSMD\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6ede\u540e\u73b0\u8c61\uff08eSMD\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u516c\u7406\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5386\u53f2\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff08SMD/eSMD\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u5386\u53f2\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5171\u4ea7\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\uff09\u7531SMD/IMD\u6bd4\u4f8b\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u540e1971\u4fe1\u8d37\u65f6\u4ee3\u7c7b\u6bd4\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\uff0c\u65b0\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u7c7b\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u5171\u4ea7\u4e3b\u4e49\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9053\u5fb7\u4e58\u6570\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u5386\u53f2\u9636\u6bb5\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5386\u53f2\u5468\u671f\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982AI\u548c\u8d85\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u4e49\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Vis-\\'a-vis no network effects, product-specific network effects amplify foreclosure and steering incentives, as a rival\u2019s growth directly undermines the platform\u2019s&nbsp; product value. Conversely, ecosystem-specific effects dampen foreclosure incentives, since rivals contribute to the overall value of the platform ecosystem. We develop a formal model illustrating how this distinction shapes platform behavior and competitive outcomes. We apply this distinction to real-world examples to illustrate its potential usefulness. Our distinction implies that regulators may want to adopt a stricter standard with no presumption of efficiencies where product-specific effects dominate. In contrast, when ecosystem-specific effects prevail, merger evaluation should mirror traditional vertical merger analysis.&nbsp; Thus, offering a more nuanced approach to merger evaluation by presenting a practical screening tool to identify problematic vertical mergers in markets featuring network effects."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u5b57\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u4ea7\u54c1\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ea7\u54c1\u7279\u5b9a\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u6392\u4ed6\u6027\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u5219\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u533a\u5206\u4ea7\u54c1\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ea7\u54c1\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5f62\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "findings": "\u4ea7\u54c1\u7279\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\uff0c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e94\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\uff1b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u6cbf\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u5782\u76f4\u5408\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5782\u76f4\u5408\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u5782\u76f4\u5408\u5e76\u3002"}}

Using a supply-side approach based on marginal cost pricing, combined with the quantity theory of money (QTM) and Moore's Law, we propose an equilibrium pricing model (EPM) for Bitcoin. The model identifies four determinants of Bitcoin's price: a time factor reflecting technological progress, an M2 factor capturing inflation, a mining difficulty factor reflecting market consensus, and a unit production time factor encapsulating scarcity. Under specific conditions, the EPM reduces to the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) and CPM models, explaining Bitcoin's cyclical price patterns and persistent premium. Empirical analysis confirms a cointegration relationship among the model's variables, with residuals forming a stationary time series. Regression analysis establishes a statistically significant long-term equilibrium, while an error correction model (ECM) elucidates the drivers of short-term price fluctuations and the reversion mechanism. Granger causality analysis reveals that the logarithmic difference of price drives the logarithmic differences of difficulty and scarcity, while the logarithmic differences of M2 and difficulty, the previous period's EPM residual, and the current ECM residual are Granger causes of the logarithmic difference of price."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u56de\u987e\u4e862013\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bef\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u6210\u672c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u4f9b\u7ed9\u4fa7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d27\u5e01\u6570\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff08QTM\uff09\u548c\u6469\u5c14\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff08EPM\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u53cd\u6620\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u6355\u6349\u901a\u80c0\u7684M2\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u53cd\u6620\u5e02\u573a\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u6316\u77ff\u96be\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f53\u73b0\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u751f\u4ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cEPM\u7b80\u5316\u4e3aStock-to-Flow\uff08S2F\uff09\u548cCPM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6ea2\u4ef7\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u6574\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f62\u6210\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u800c\u8bef\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\uff08ECM\uff09\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u77ed\u671f\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5236\u3002\u683c\u5170\u6770\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u9a71\u52a8\u4e86\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800cM2\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u524d\u4e00\u671f\u7684EPM\u6b8b\u5dee\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u7684ECM\u6b8b\u5dee\u662f\u4ef7\u683c\u5bf9\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u683c\u5170\u6770\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "research_question": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff08EPM\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u4ef7\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7ea0\u6b63\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8fb9\u9645\u6210\u672c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001\u8d27\u5e01\u6570\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff08QTM\uff09\u3001\u6469\u5c14\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3001Stock-to-Flow\uff08S2F\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3001CPM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f9b\u7ed9\u4fa7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5747\u8861\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff08EPM\uff09\u3001\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff08\u534f\u6574\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u683c\u5170\u6770\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u534f\u6574\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u683c\u5170\u6770\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff08EPM\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4ef7\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u76d1\u7ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We combine theory and empirical analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of our hedging strategy in mitigating risks exposed by the Federal Reserve's rapid rate hikes in 2022. Using detailed data from bank security portfolios, we show that implementing our self-financing swaption-based hedge could have reduced peak aggregate unrealized portfolio losses by at least 30%, with an average quarterly cost under 10 basis points on long-duration securities. Unlike conventional methods, our approach dynamically protects against extreme downside risk without significantly reducing net interest margins (NIM), preserving banks' maturity transformation capabilities in stable conditions. Using a novel measure of technical bank runs, we estimate that our hedge significantly lowers the likelihood of such events. Our findings provide the first market-based evidence that integrating swaption hedging into bank asset-liability management (ALM) can stabilize margins, reduce losses, and help prevent depositor runs during volatile rate environments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u6362\u671f\u6743\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u51b2\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u671f\u9650\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u5bf9\u51b2\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7f13\u89e32022\u5e74\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u5feb\u901f\u52a0\u606f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5c06\u5cf0\u503c\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3\u5c1130%\uff0c\u4e14\u5b63\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e10\u4e2a\u57fa\u70b9\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u62a4\u6781\u7aef\u4e0b\u884c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u51c0\u606f\u5dee\uff08NIM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6280\u672f\u6027\u94f6\u884c\u6324\u5151\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u6362\u671f\u6743\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u51b2\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u671f\u9650\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u52a0\u606f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u98ce\u9669\uff1f", "motivation": "2022\u5e74\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u5feb\u901f\u52a0\u606f\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u6781\u7aef\u4e0b\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u53c8\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u51c0\u606f\u5dee\u7684\u5bf9\u51b2\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u671f\u9650\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e92\u6362\u671f\u6743\u5bf9\u51b2\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8d44\u4ea7-\u8d1f\u503a\u7ba1\u7406\uff08ALM\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u94f6\u884c\u8bc1\u5238\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u51b2\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u65bd\u8be5\u5bf9\u51b2\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5c06\u5cf0\u503c\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3\u5c1130%\uff0c\u5b63\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e10\u4e2a\u57fa\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6280\u672f\u6027\u94f6\u884c\u6324\u5151\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u4e92\u6362\u671f\u6743\u5bf9\u51b2\u6574\u5408\u5230\u94f6\u884cALM\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e02\u573a\u5316\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u5229\u6da6\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9632\u6b62\u6324\u5151\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u51b2\u6781\u7aef\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u671f\u9650\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6ce2\u52a8\u5229\u7387\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

It traces the evolution of the doctorate from a medieval rite of scholarly passage to a contemporary arena in which machines can generate text, map knowledge gaps, and synthesise apparent novelty at scale. The discussion references the seminal work 'Attention is All You Need', which introduced the Transformer architecture underlying modern LLMs. Far from diminishing the doctoral enterprise, these developments raise the bar: they compel researchers to cultivate originality, epistemic integrity, and discernment that no algorithm can replicate. The argument centres on the enduring value of mathematics-especially symmetry-as a language of clarity and rigour in an era of synthetic fluency. Finally, the paper considers Africa's unique position: a continent challenged to rediscover the existential urge to know that defined its preindependence aspirations, before post-independence turmoil created the institution of 'grab-andrun'. Doctoral research, it concludes, must reawaken that deep existential meaning of knowing.

Employing a timevarying parameter vector autoregression model, we find that the expectation of expansionary monetary policy is associated with economic downturns or inflation declines. Furthermore, monetary policy expectation is more responsive to GDP during downturns and more sensitive to CPI during economic booms."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u53d9\u4e8b\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u6307\u6570\uff08MPE^N\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u67e5\u6307\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u3001\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5f20\u6027\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8870\u9000\u6216\u901a\u80c0\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u671f\u5bf9GDP\u548cCPI\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u968f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5468\u671f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u6307\u6570\uff08MPE^N\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efaMPE^N\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u6269\u5f20\u6027\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8870\u9000\u6216\u901a\u80c0\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u9884\u671f\u5bf9GDP\u548cCPI\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u968f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5468\u671f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u671f\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Using a panel of 69 banks in advanced economies that acquired at least one fintech firm between 2013 and 2021, we examine how these transactions affect deposits growth, credit supply, asset allocation, and risk of the acquiring bank compared to non-acquiring ones. Following the acquisition, banks experience a significant increase in deposits and a moderate expansion in lending. However, a large share of the incremental funding is allocated to securities and other interest-earning assets rather than loans. We also find that loan quality deteriorates post-acquisition: non-performing loans rise disproportionately relative to total lending, and bank-level default risk increases. These effects appear driven by the integration of fintech lending practices-specifically, looser credit standards and weaker monitoring. Our findings highlight both the benefits and unintended consequences of fintech integration. They suggest that while acquisitions may enhance digital capabilities and market reach, they can also amplify risk exposures, with implications for bank supervision and financial stability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u94f6\u884c\u6536\u8d2d\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6536\u8d2d\u540e\u5b58\u6b3e\u589e\u957f\u4f46\u8d37\u6b3e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "research_question": "\u4f20\u7edf\u94f6\u884c\u6536\u8d2d\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u5bf9\u5b58\u6b3e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u4fe1\u8d37\u4f9b\u5e94\u3001\u8d44\u4ea7\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u5d1b\u8d77\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u94f6\u884c\u6784\u6210\u7ade\u4e89\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u8d2d\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u6574\u5408\u5bf9\u94f6\u884c\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282013-2021\u5e74\u95f469\u5bb6\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6536\u8d2d\u4e0e\u975e\u6536\u8d2d\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "findings": "\u6536\u8d2d\u540e\u5b58\u6b3e\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u8d37\u6b3e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e0d\u826f\u8d37\u6b3e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u6574\u5408\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u94f6\u884c\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u653f\u7b56\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u6536\u8d2d\u540e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Under MMAs, a platform can threaten the seller to flood the market demand by pricing low and capturing a guaranteed profit.

We focus on two key channels-divestment from high-emitting borrowers and engagement through screening and monitoring-while differentiating between relationship (existing) and non-relationship (new) lending, sectoral exposures, and carbon pricing regimes. We find strong evidence of divestment but limited engagement. Financed emissions from new energy-sector borrowers fell by over 20%, driven by both reduced lending volumes and a shift toward lower-emitting firms. In contrast, emissions in relationship lending portfolios remained largely unchanged, indicating banks' reluctance to sever ties with existing, profitable borrowers. Banks' responses varied by borrower regulatory environments. All banks curtailed financing to non-relationship borrowers in regulated countries, while Brown-regulated banks also divested from relationship borrowers in unregulated countries. Engagement was evident mainly in energy-sector relationship lending to borrowers located in countries with carbon pricing regimes. Borrowers' broader financing environments also influenced outcomes. Brown banks reduced financed emissions in energy-sector relationship portfolios only when borrowers lacked ESG-oriented investors. In contrast, when borrowers had ESG stakeholders, relationship lending sometimes saw increased emissions. Overall, the Paris Agreement induced selective portfolio decarbonization, with divestment concentrated in new, high-emitting borrowers rather than through deeper engagement with existing clients. These findings highlight the limits of voluntary bank-led engagement and reveals that banks' climate strategies depend critically on lending relationships, borrower characteristics, and the surrounding regulatory and investor contexts."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u300a\u5df4\u9ece\u534f\u5b9a\u300b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u94f6\u56e2\u8d37\u6b3e\u7ec4\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u94f6\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u64a4\u8d44\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u4e0e\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u501f\u8d37\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u78b3\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5236\u5ea6\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "research_question": "\u300a\u5df4\u9ece\u534f\u5b9a\u300b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u94f6\u56e2\u8d37\u6b3e\u7ec4\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u6392\u653e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u300a\u5df4\u9ece\u534f\u5b9a\u300b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u94f6\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u878d\u8d44\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u94f6\u56e2\u8d37\u6b3e\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u501f\u8d37\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u78b3\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5236\u5ea6\u3002", "findings": "\u94f6\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u64a4\u8d44\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u65b0\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e1a\u878d\u8d44\u6392\u653e\u51cf\u5c1120%\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u501f\u8d37\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u6392\u653e\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u9650\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u94f6\u884c\u6c14\u5019\u6218\u7565\u5bf9\u501f\u8d37\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u94f6\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u81ea\u613f\u53c2\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast, physical risks' unpredictability and mitigating factors like insurance or government interventions may explain their limited market impact."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8f6c\u578b\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u6b27\u6d32\u671f\u6743\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u8f6c\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5de6\u5c3e\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u659c\u73870.002\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53f3\u5c3e\u659c\u73870.001\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0b\u884c\u4fdd\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u8f6c\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7a81\u51fa\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u4fdd\u9669\u6216\u653f\u5e9c\u5e72\u9884\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8f6c\u578b\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6b27\u6d32\u671f\u6743\u5e02\u573a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u671f\u6743\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u6d32\u671f\u6743\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u7269\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8f6c\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u5de6\u5c3e\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u659c\u73870.002\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u53f3\u5c3e\u659c\u73870.001\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f6c\u578b\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u671f\u6743\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This clause plays a key role in ensuring the effectiveness of sanctions and, ultimately, the objectives of EU external action. This article intends to shed light on the obligations arising from the anti-circumvention clause, with a specific focus on financial restrictive measures against designated individuals (which essentially entail asset freeze measures against them). First, the scope of the anti-circumvention clause under EU law is defined. Second, the actors involved in uncovering and countering circumvention practices within the territory of the Union are presented, illustrating the central role of the Member States in coordinating national and supranational efforts to ensure compliance with EU restrictive measures, through constant dialogue and cooperation with financial operators and the European Commission. Third, one specific circumvention strategy is explored, namely circumvention through family members. More precisely, the article investigates whether there is a presumption of circumvention when family members are involved. To this end, it considers the case law of the ECJ on the legality of family members\u2019 designations under EU sanctions. Throughout the analysis, the article emphasizes how the exceptional circumstances in relation to the war in Ukraine have progressively changed the design of EU restrictive measures as well as the commitment of the Union to tackle circumvention. In this context, the unprecedented emphasis on circumvention is complemented by the Union\u2019s unprecedented desire to resort to criminal enforcement. Accordingly, the effectiveness of EU restrictive measures has become a call for effective criminal enforcement.

Their publicly traded stock is ignored and left to languish, slowly fading into obscurity. This fate can be avoided if the corporation can connect to a new external source of information-energy. Opportunities to do so are only available during a transition phase in the economic system, when an old order is disrupted by the creative destruction initiated by entrepreneurial innovation and the process of reconstituting a new equilibrium begins. Corporate managers know this, or sense it at least. During transition phases we witness the eagerness of the quicker ones among them to be associated, no matter how tenuously, with the innovation of the day. Bitcoin is different from other innovations. It is egalitarian by nature, open to any corporation seeking to bring itself in from the cold.

These approaches typically rely on restrictive parametric assumptions and are often vulnerable to model misspecification. To address this issue, we introduce a novel nonparametric prediction method for the future intraday instantaneous volatility process during trading hours, which leverages both previous days' data and the current day's observed intraday data. Our approach imposes an interday-by-intraday matrix representation of the instantaneous volatility, which is decomposed into a low-rank conditional expectation component and a noise matrix. To predict the future conditional expected volatility vector, we exploit this low-rank structure and propose the Structural Intraday-volatility Prediction (SIP) procedure. We establish the asymptotic properties of the SIP estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness through an out-of-sample prediction study using real high-frequency trading data."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SIP\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u6613\u65e5\u5185\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9891\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u636e\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u6613\u65e5\u5185\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eIt\u00f4\u534a\u9785\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u77ac\u65f6\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\uff08\u4f4e\u79e9\u6761\u4ef6\u671f\u671b\u5206\u91cf\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u77e9\u9635\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6761\u4ef6\u671f\u671b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "findings": "SIP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u9891\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u77ac\u65f6\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u4ea4\u6613\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We show that (i) optimal protection, measured by infant industry output, declines over time and is less than that under public information and (ii) eventual viability of the infant industry is not necessary for optimal protection under private information."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e7c\u7a1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ea7\u4e1a\u521d\u59cb\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5916\u56fd\u7ade\u4e89\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u5e72\u4e2d\u5b66\u201d\u968f\u673a\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002\u4ea7\u4e1a\u662f\u5426\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u662f\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4ea7\u4e1a\u771f\u5b9e\u63ed\u793a\u6210\u672c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(i) \u4ee5\u5e7c\u7a1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4ea7\u51fa\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u62a4\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4f4e\u4e8e\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1b(ii) \u5e7c\u7a1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u6700\u7ec8\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u6d3b\u5e76\u975e\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "research_question": "\u5e7c\u7a1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e7c\u7a1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea7\u4e1a\u521d\u59cb\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "findings": "(i) \u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u62a4\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u9012\u51cf\u4e14\u4f4e\u4e8e\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1b(ii) \u5e7c\u7a1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u6700\u7ec8\u5b58\u6d3b\u4e0e\u5426\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7c\u7a1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e7c\u7a1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4fdd\u62a4\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To quantify the extent to which rising housing cost contributed to this decline, a heterogeneous-agent life cycle model is constructed in which individuals endogenously choose fertility and housing tenure over the life cycle. Housing cost is captured through three channels: house prices, mortgage leverage regulation, and mortgage interest repayment burdens. Using a model calibrated to the Korean economy in 2015, counterfactual experiments reveal that approximately one-third of the observed fertility decline-equivalent to 0.17 fewer births per woman-can be attributed to the increase in housing cost. Among the three components, tighter borrowing constraints and higher interest rates are particularly influential in delaying childbirth, providing a structural explanation for the rising age at first birth and its contribution to Korea's fertility decline."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u97e9\u56fd\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u4ece2015\u5e74\u76841.24\u964d\u81f32023\u5e74\u76840.72\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5f02\u8d28\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff08\u7ea60.17\u4e2a\u5b69\u5b50\uff09\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u501f\u8d37\u7ea6\u675f\u6536\u7d27\u548c\u5229\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u751f\u80b2\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "research_question": "\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u5bf9\u97e9\u56fd\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u591a\u5927\uff1f", "motivation": "\u97e9\u56fd\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u91cf\u5316\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u5bf9\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5f02\u8d28\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5185\u751f\u5316\u751f\u80b2\u548c\u4f4f\u623f\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6821\u51c6\u81f32015\u5e74\u97e9\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "findings": "\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff08\u7ea60.17\u4e2a\u5b69\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u501f\u8d37\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5229\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u53ef\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u5bf9\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u501f\u8d37\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5229\u7387\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

Additional cross-sectional evidence suggests that reduced transition risks contribute to the lower cost of loans.

Evaluating the economic and ecological outcomes of easements with different restrictions is crucial for achieving conservation goals and promoting resilient forest management. This study applies a Markovian forest growth model to simulate the dynamics of naturally regenerated mixed loblolly pine-hardwood forests under different management regimes, which can reflect different levels of land-use restrictions within conservation easements. The regimes include an intensive one with frequent, aggressive harvests and a conservative one that restricts harvesting to prioritize ecological preservation. The analysis evaluates trade-offs between reduced timber revenues and enhanced ecological benefits from carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Results show that adopting a conservative management regime increases species diversity by 3.9% and size diversity by 21.4%. This leads to a carbon benefit of $463 per acre but comes with a $373 per acre reduction in timber revenue, yielding a benefit-cost ratio of 1.24.

Yet, empirical evidence remains scarce on who adopts agroecological practices and on what types of farms. A widely accepted narrative suggests that smallholders are more rooted in agroecological systems, while larger, better-endowed farms follow \u201cconventional\u201d models. This paper challenges that dualistic view by examining the relationship between farm structure and the diversity of agroecological practices across multiple African contexts. For this purpose it informs the diversity of existing patterns of farms structure and starting points of agroecological transition \u2013 defined as current state of agroecological principles implemented by farms along their trajectories. These starting points offer valuable insights into how transitions might unfold and how policies can support them. Using harmonized data from 2,721 farms across nine study areas in six African countries, the article shows that starting points of agroecological transitions are highly diverse and influenced by farm structures. Three patterns emerge:\u00a0smallest farms mostly combine autonomy and income diversification while larger farms tend to combine conventional intensification with crop-livestock integration. Other small to medium scale farms are characterised by more land allocated to legume contributing to soil health. Future agricultural policies should consider this diversity of patterns in providing locally-relevant support to promote sustainable transitions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u5b9e\u8df5\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u8f6c\u578b\u8d77\u70b9\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u5b9e\u8df5\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u519c\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u7eff\u8272\u9769\u547d\uff09\u5728\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u548c\u519c\u573a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u8f6c\u578b\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u516d\u4e2a\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e5d\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u533a\u57df\u76842,721\u4e2a\u519c\u573a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u8f6c\u578b\u8d77\u70b9\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u53d7\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u6700\u5c0f\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u6536\u5165\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u7ea6\u5316\u4e0e\u519c\u7267\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b\u519c\u573a\u5219\u6ce8\u91cd\u571f\u58e4\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u8c46\u7c7b\u79cd\u690d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8f6c\u578b\u8def\u5f84\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u519c\u4e1a\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u519c\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u672c\u5730\u5316\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

We conducted a large-scale controlled experiment across three categories of SPs: primary care doctors, course instructors, and fitness trainers. Participants ranked quality-related attributes (experience, communication, compassion) and then made selections among hypothetical SPs, some of whom displayed a rainbow flag<span>\u2014</span>a widely recognized LGBTQ+ safety cue. We find that, on average, SPs displaying the flag were 16.4% less likely to be selected, a statistically significant effect. However, this aggregate effect masks important heterogeneity: LGBTQ+ participants showed a positive preference for SPs displaying the flag; whereas, the flag\u2019s negative effect was more pronounced for men vs. women.&nbsp; In terms of age, younger participants perceive the flag more positively; however, further analysis suggests that this is likely driven by a higher LGBTQ+ identification among them. Moreover, individuals with higher LGBTQ+ awareness or greater openness-to-experience scores responded more favorably to the flag. Our findings underscore the nuanced trade-offs involved in signaling LGBTQ+ inclusivity within service settings. Although displaying such safety cues in the SP selection process can enhance trust and comfort for LGBTQ+ clients, they can deter some non-LGBTQ+ clients, particularly those who are older, male or less familiar with LGBTQ+ concepts. As such, managers should carefully consider the demographic and ideological composition of their clientele when deciding on implementing such cues."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u5c55\u793aLGBTQ+\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u5f69\u8679\u65d7\uff09\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5f69\u8679\u65d7\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u88ab\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e16.4%\uff0c\u4f46LGBTQ+\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u5176\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u7537\u6027\u4e2d\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u548c\u5bf9LGBTQ+\u66f4\u719f\u6089\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u3002", "research_question": "\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u5c55\u793aLGBTQ+\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u9009\u62e9\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\uff0c\u800cLGBTQ+\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u7c7b\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\uff08\u533b\u751f\u3001\u6559\u5e08\u3001\u5065\u8eab\u6559\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u5c55\u793a\u5f69\u8679\u65d7\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "findings": "\u5c55\u793a\u5f69\u8679\u65d7\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u88ab\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e16.4%\uff0c\u4f46LGBTQ+\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u5176\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u7537\u6027\u4e2d\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u548c\u5bf9LGBTQ+\u66f4\u719f\u6089\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LGBTQ+\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u6839\u636e\u5ba2\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u8c28\u614e\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u91c7\u7528LGBTQ+\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

However, widely used activation functions such as ReLU, ELU, Swish, and GELU still have certain limitations. Issues such as exploding gradients, vanishing gradients, and dead neurons can negatively affect stability and overall performance, especially in very deep architectures. In this study, a novel activation function called CahLU (Cauchy Hazard Linear Unit), inspired by survival analysis literature, is proposed to overcome these limitations. By combining logarithmic and arctangent components, CahLU aims to regulate gradient magnitudes and improve numerical stability while ensuring smoother gradient flow.The effectiveness of CahLU was tested on a wide range of datasets with varying levels of complexity (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, COCO128, Brain Tumor MRI, African Wildlife, VisDrone, etc.) and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNet, SENet18, GoogLeNet, YOLOv8). The models were evaluated based on classification metrics (accuracy, loss, standard deviation) as well as object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding boxes (precision, recall, mAP@50, mAP@50-95).Experimental results demonstrated that CahLU achieves superior or highly competitive accuracy compared to functions like ReLU, Swish, Mish, and GELU, while maintaining gradient stability even in networks as deep as 700 layers. Moreover, time-based performance analyses showed that despite a modest increase in computational time compared to some built-in optimized functions, the accuracy and stability gains offered by CahLU effectively balance this cost. Successful integration into YOLOv8-based object detection tasks further supports its practical applicability. The findings suggest that CahLU provides a promising and robust alternative for deep learning activation functions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570CahLU\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u548c\u53cd\u6b63\u5207\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982ReLU\u3001Swish\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u6d88\u5931\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6b7b\u4ea1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCahLU\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982ReLU\u3001Swish\u7b49\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u6d88\u5931\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6b7b\u4ea1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6570\u548c\u53cd\u6b63\u5207\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1CahLU\uff0c\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u68af\u5ea6\u5e45\u5ea6\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\uff08VGG16\u3001ResNet50\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5CahLU\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u3002", "findings": "CahLU\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6781\u6df1\u7f51\u7edc\uff08700\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728YOLOv8\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "CahLU\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Interaction between higher education institutions and communities requires the implementation of partnership mechanisms and overcoming challenges to their practical strategic cooperation. The article outlines the mechanisms, challenges and prospects of interaction between higher education institutions and communities in the context of the public administration system. The article aims to identify the most promising strategies for interaction between these entities and assess their implementation's effectiveness. The research was conducted using analytical methods, questionnaires, comparison of the results obtained and statistical assessment of the effectiveness of implementation of the strategies of interaction between higher education institutions and communities, which were identified as the most effective. To select the most effective strategies for cooperation between higher education institutions and communities, criteria and indicators for their evaluation were developed. Improving the quality of management decisions based on the provision of expert advice, applying the principles of digitalisation and public-private partnerships, developing and forming clusters and start-up incubators to support businesses and communities, conducting advanced training and courses at higher education institutions, and using scientific developments of higher education institutions to address infrastructure and sustainable development issues were identified as the most effective and require further implementation during the expert assessment. The statistical assessment of the effectiveness of interaction between higher education institutions and communities before and after implementing the proposed strategies showed a positive effect of their implementation. In the context of sustainable and long-term implementation of the outlined strategies, higher education institutions can perform educational and scientific functions and be full-fledged subjects of public administration, contributing to the socioeconomic development of all participants in such interaction."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u3001\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u3001\u516c\u79c1\u5408\u4f5c\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u5728\u57f9\u517b\u4eba\u624d\u3001\u79d1\u7814\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u5408\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u516c\u5171\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u516c\u79c1\u5408\u4f5c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u6bd4\u8f83\u53ca\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u3001\u516c\u79c1\u5408\u4f5c\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u4e92\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u548c\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5982\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Consistency criteria \u00e0 la Hommes and Zhu (2014) between perceived and actual laws of motion of inflation might allow for multiple expectational equilibria. Unfortunately, multiple equilibria models pose challenges for empirical validation. This paper proposes a latent Markov chain process to dynamically separate such equilibria. Moreover, an original Bayesian inference approach based on hierarchical priors is introduced, which naturally offers the possibility of incorporating equilibrium-identifying constraints with various degrees of prior beliefs. Finally, an inference procedure is proposed to assess a posteriori the probability that the theoretical constraints are satisfied and to estimate the equilibrium changes over time. We show that common prior assumptions regarding structural parameters favor the separation of equilibria, thereby making the Bayesian inference a natural framework for Markov-switching Phillips curve models. Empirical evidence obtained from observed inflation, output gap, and the consensus expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters supports multiple equilibria, and we find evidence of temporal variation in over-and under-reaction patterns, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously documented. Specifically, we observe that agents tend to underreact to shocks when inflation is high and persistent, whereas they behave substantially as fully informed forecasters when the inflation level is low and stable, i.e., after the mid-nineties. We also find that the model does not suffer from the missing disinflation puzzle during the Great Recession."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65b0\u51ef\u6069\u65af\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u975e\u7406\u6027\u9884\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u591a\u91cd\u9884\u671f\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u91cd\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u65b0\u51ef\u6069\u65af\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u66f2\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u91cd\u9884\u671f\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u591a\u91cd\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u80c0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u65b0\u51ef\u6069\u65af\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u66f2\u7ebf\u3001Hommes\u548cZhu\uff082014\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u3001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5747\u8861\u8bc6\u522b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u591a\u91cd\u5747\u8861\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u591a\u91cd\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5728\u9ad8\u901a\u80c0\u65f6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4f4e\u901a\u80c0\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u6027\u9884\u671f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u591a\u91cd\u5747\u8861\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u65b0\u51ef\u6069\u65af\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u9884\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u80c0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

The contribution of this research is mainly twofold. First, it considers different dimensions of loneliness and accounts for its predetermined component stemming from social isolation in childhood and adverse childhood experiences. Second, it disentangles the effects of loneliness and trust by incorporating actual trust behaviour from a large-scale trust game experiment conducted in 27 European member states, involving more than 25,000 individuals. The richness of the data allows to account for and disentangle the impact of competitive explanatory factors such as emotions, objective social isolation, social media use and economic preferences. The main findings suggest the following: (i) social loneliness significantly impacts populist voting, particularly on the extreme right, whereas the emotional dimension of loneliness is associated with more left-leaning, but non-populist, voting preferences; (ii) higher levels of actual trust are associated with lower support for right-wing populist parties; (iii) loneliness and trust operate through distinct channels: loneliness exerts a greater impact on women and older individuals, while trust plays a more significant role among men and middle-aged individuals, and (iv) the effect of social loneliness on support of populist parties is significantly attenuated in contexts with a history of recurrent economic crises, suggesting a potential experience-based learning mechanism."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b64\u72ec\u611f\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u6295\u7968\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u5b64\u72ec\u611f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u53f3\u7ffc\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u800c\u60c5\u611f\u5b64\u72ec\u4e0e\u975e\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u5de6\u7ffc\u6295\u7968\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u9ad8\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u53f3\u7ffc\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u653f\u515a\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002", "research_question": "\u5b64\u72ec\u611f\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u6295\u7968\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5b64\u72ec\u611f\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5bf9\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u6295\u7968\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u53ca\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u5b64\u72ec\u611f\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u5b64\u72ec\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u7ae5\u5e74\u793e\u4f1a\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u752827\u4e2a\u6b27\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d85\u8fc725,000\u4eba\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u4efb\u6e38\u620f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "findings": "\u793e\u4f1a\u5b64\u72ec\u611f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u53f3\u7ffc\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5b64\u72ec\u4e0e\u975e\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u5de6\u7ffc\u6295\u7968\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u9ad8\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u53f3\u7ffc\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u652f\u6301\uff1b\u5b64\u72ec\u611f\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b64\u72ec\u611f\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5bf9\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u6295\u7968\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u6295\u7968\u503e\u5411\u3002"}}

Mechanism analysis using firm-level event studies reveals that negative reallocation effects are caused by high-productivity firms taking up the funds and subsequently becoming more liquidity constrained, leading to slowdowns in employment growth."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u5171\u540c\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5411\u4f4e\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u3002", "research_question": "\u5730\u65b9\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6b27\u76df\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u65b9\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u57dfGDP\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d1f\u503a\u8868\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5411\u4f4e\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4f01\u4e1a\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5730\u65b9\u6027\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

The original study found underplacement - the majority of their sample apparently expected to perform worse than others - in difficult tasks with monetary incentives, contradicting the widely held assumption of a general human tendency toward overconfidence. This paper challenges the comparability of the two payment schemes, arguing that differences in outcome structures and non-monetary motives may have influenced participants' choices beyond misconfidence. In an online replication of their experiment, a fixed-outcome distribution lottery mechanism with interdependent success probabilities and no variance in the number of winners - designed to better align with the performance-based payment scheme - is compared against the probabilistic-outcome distribution lottery used in the original study, which features an independent success probability and a variable number of winners. The results align more closely with traditional overplacement patterns than underplacement, as nearly three-fourths of participants prefer the performance-based option regardless of lottery design. Key predictors of voting behavior include expected performance, group performance estimations, and sample question outcomes, while factors such as social comparison tendencies and risk attitudes play no significant role. Self-reported voting rationales highlight the influence of normative beliefs, control preferences, and feedback signals beyond confidence.

We introduce the AI Education Passport (AIP), a blockchain-secured global credentialing system, to certify these competencies and enable transitions, like data clerks becoming validators, with scalability and trust (Takakubo et al., 2024). Since 2010, STEM jobs grew 50% while retail fell 25%, with 260 million jobs projected to churn by 2030, netting 78 million, and 67% of employers prioritizing AI skills (World Economic Forum, 2025; Deming et al., 2025).

The current Irish tax system, which remains partially joint since the early 2000\u0092s, provides a financial advantage to married couples by allowing them to to share tax bands and credits. However, it also creates a financial disincentive for secondary earners (who are typically women) to work. Using the microsimulation model, SWITCH, we estimate the distributional effect of moving to a fully individualised tax system in Ireland. We find that this would result in income losses, which increase with the level of income. Linking SWITCH to a discrete choice labour supply model, we then estimate the behavioural response of married couples to a fully individualised tax regime. We find that a shift to individualised taxation would result in increased labour supply of married women, and a reduction in the hours worked by married men due to intra-household labour substitution effects. We explore the implications of this for a range of outcomes linked to womens\u0092 financial independence."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u4ece\u8054\u5408\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u5b8c\u5168\u4e2a\u4eba\u5316\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5236\u7684\u518d\u5206\u914d\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e2a\u4eba\u5316\u7a0e\u5236\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u5165\u635f\u5931\uff08\u968f\u6536\u5165\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u5df2\u5a5a\u5973\u6027\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5df2\u5a5a\u7537\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "research_question": "\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u4ece\u8054\u5408\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u5b8c\u5168\u4e2a\u4eba\u5316\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u5236\u5bf9\u518d\u5206\u914d\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7a0e\u5236\u4e3a\u5df2\u5a5a\u592b\u5987\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d22\u52a1\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6b21\u8981\u6536\u5165\u8005\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5973\u6027\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6291\u5236\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u7a0e\u5236\u6539\u9769\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0e\u6536\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bb6\u5ead\u5185\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578bSWITCH\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u9009\u62e9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u4e2a\u4eba\u5316\u7a0e\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u5165\u635f\u5931\uff08\u6536\u5165\u8d8a\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u8d8a\u5927\uff09\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5df2\u5a5a\u5973\u6027\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5df2\u5a5a\u7537\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7a0e\u6536\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead\u5185\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u7a0e\u5236\u6539\u9769\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u8d22\u52a1\u72ec\u7acb\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Variations in rates of return to years of schooling across migrant workers working in the same urban labor market but having different sites of basic education provide for direct estimation of provincial school quality. Corroborating this approach, these school quality estimates prove to be highly correlated with provincial cognitive skill test scores for the same demographic group. Returns to quality increase with economic development level of destination cities. Importantly, quality appears higher and provincial variation appears lower for younger cohorts, indicating at least partial effectiveness of more recent policies aimed at improving rural school quality across provinces. Surprisingly, however, provincial variations in quality are uncorrelated with teacher-student ratio or per student spending."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u6751\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u519c\u6c11\u5de5\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6536\u5165\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e86\u5404\u7701\u519c\u6751\u5b66\u6821\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u56de\u62a5\u968f\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u57ce\u5e02\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5e74\u8f7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u7701\u9645\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd1\u5e74\u653f\u7b56\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u6548\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e08\u751f\u6bd4\u6216\u751f\u5747\u652f\u51fa\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u6751\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u6751\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7701\u9645\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u519c\u6c11\u5de5\u6536\u5165\u5dee\u5f02\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u519c\u6c11\u5de5\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u57ce\u5e02\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u7701\u4efd\u57fa\u7840\u6559\u80b2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6536\u5165\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u7701\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "findings": "\u5b66\u6821\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u56de\u62a5\u968f\u57ce\u5e02\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u5e74\u8f7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u7701\u9645\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e08\u751f\u6bd4\u6216\u751f\u5747\u652f\u51fa\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u519c\u6751\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u975e\u63d0\u5347\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

RVE integrates concepts from field theory, neural networks, graph theory, information theory, and complex adaptive systems to model economic activity as dynamic value ripples propagating through interconnected networks over time. Unlike conventional approaches that treat GDP, inflation, and trade as primitive variables, RVE derives these as emergent properties of deeper mathematical forces governing value transmission, infrastructure dependencies, trust dynamics, and adaptive feedback loops. This framework provides a unified mathematical language capable of modeling modern economic realities including digital infrastructure asymmetries, informal economies, cross-border value flows, and systemic adaptation mechanisms that traditional economics cannot adequately represent."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Ripple Vector Economics\uff08RVE\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6807\u91cf\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u5272\u3002RVE\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u573a\u8bba\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u56fe\u8bba\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u548c\u590d\u6742\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6d3b\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u6d9f\u6f2a\u5728\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u73b0\u4ee3\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b57\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u8de8\u5883\u4ef7\u503c\u6d41\u52a8\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u63cf\u8ff0\u73b0\u4ee3\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "RVE\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u573a\u8bba\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u56fe\u8bba\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u548c\u590d\u6742\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u6d9f\u6f2a\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u6570\u5b66\u529b\u91cf\u3002", "findings": "RVE\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21GDP\u3001\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u8d38\u6613\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u601d\u7ef4\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b57\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, this article exposes a critical contradiction in the EU's energy diversification strategy: the increasing likelihood that Russian gas is being rerouted through Azerbaijan and sold into European markets under the Azerbaijani label. Drawing on recent supply data, contract developments, infrastructure bottlenecks, and energy partnerships, the study demonstrates that Azerbaijan lacks the production capacity to fulfill its ambitious export pledges to the EU without supplementing domestic supplies through imports from Russia and Turkmenistan. The article also highlights the growing role of Russian companies in Azerbaijan's gas value chain, including Lukoil's significant stake in the Shah Deniz field. An input-output analysis of Azerbaijan's 2023 gas flows reveals a troubling statistical imbalance, raising the possibility of indirect Russian gas re-exports to the EU. The paper concludes that Europe's shortterm geopolitical needs have eclipsed its long-term energy independence goals, and that without stricter supply chain transparency and oversight, the EU risks undermining its own energy security and climate commitments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u6b27\u76df\u80fd\u6e90\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6218\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u8865\u5145\u4f9b\u5e94\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u5411\u6b27\u76df\u51fa\u53e3\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5929\u7136\u6c14\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u6b27\u76df\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u627f\u8bfa\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u76df\u4e0e\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u5408\u4f5c\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u95f4\u63a5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5929\u7136\u6c14\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6b27\u76df\u8bd5\u56fe\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u80fd\u6e90\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u901a\u8fc7\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u6d41\u5165\u6b27\u76df\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6218\u7565\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f9b\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5408\u540c\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u75862023\u5e74\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "findings": "\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u7f3a\u4e4f\u72ec\u7acb\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b27\u76df\u51fa\u53e3\u627f\u8bfa\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u548c\u571f\u5e93\u66fc\u65af\u5766\u8fdb\u53e3\u8865\u5145\u4f9b\u5e94\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6218\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u547c\u5401\u6b27\u76df\u52a0\u5f3a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u95f4\u63a5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5929\u7136\u6c14\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

This has long been understood to be true of the human brain, but recent implementation of large-scale interpretive systems<i> in silico</i> holds forth the possibility of tractable general equilibrium models of human cooperation in open-ended worlds."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5e38\u88ab\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u800c\u535a\u5f08\u7b56\u7565\u5219\u88ab\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cGoodhart\u5b9a\u5f8b\u8868\u660e\u6709\u9650\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u201c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u201d\u7684\u975e\u7b26\u53f7\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u6709\u9650\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Goodhart\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7c7b\u522b\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u975e\u7b26\u53f7\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "findings": "\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u6709\u9650\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This Article challenges that narrative, arguing that sanctions are a form of economic warfare that frequently precedes or complements military conflict. Rather than achieving their intended political goals, sanctions often inflict disproportionate harm on civilian populations. The Article critiques the prevailing frameworks in international law, which have failed to address the destructive nature of sanctions or to regulate their use effectively. By analyzing historical patterns and contemporary practices, it highlights the need for a more robust normative approach to economic sanctions.</p>\n<p>The Article introduces three distinct theories of sanctions, each offering a different perspective on their role and impact. It calls them the Compliance Theory of Sanctions, the Humanitarian Theory of Sanctions, and the Critical Theory of Sanctions. It shows the limitation of each theory. This Article offers a new perspective. Economic sanctions, the Article argues, risk destabilizing the post-World War II liberal order by undermining global economic stability and international cooperation. As the world shifts from a unipolar to a multipolar structure, overreliance on sanctions heightens tensions and invites retaliatory actions, potentially leading to broader conflicts. To counter these risks, the Article proposes a new normative framework that confines sanctions to serious violations of peremptory norms of international law affecting human dignity. The Article\u2019s normative framework emphasizes clear objectives, robust monitoring mechanisms, and international oversight to ensure accountability. It also advocates for practical measures like sunset clauses to prevent indefinite sanctions and restrictions on unilateral actions to avoid misuse. By redefining the role of economic sanctions, the Article seeks to establish a more just and stable global order, using sanctions as a tool of last resort rather than a default policy instrument.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5236\u88c1\u662f\u548c\u5e73\u66ff\u4ee3\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5236\u88c1\u662f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u519b\u4e8b\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u6279\u8bc4\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u7ba1\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5236\u88c1\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u548c\u5e73\u66ff\u4ee3\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff1f\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e73\u6c11\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u76d1\u7ba1\u5236\u88c1\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5408\u89c4\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6279\u5224\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5f53\u4ee3\u5b9e\u8df5\u5206\u6790\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u5236\u88c1\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u519b\u4e8b\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e73\u6c11\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u516c\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u5168\u7403\u79e9\u5e8f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u56fd\u9645\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u65e5\u843d\u6761\u6b3e\u548c\u9650\u5236\u5355\u8fb9\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5236\u88c1\u6ee5\u7528\u3002"}}

It highlights that, compared to previous sanctions practice, the new criterion adopts an innovative sector-based approach, establishing a new link between businesspersons operating in certain economic sectors and vital source of revenue for the Russian government. The Insight further explores the Court's cautious stance on de-listing Russian businesspersons, emphasizing the prudent assessment of evidence and circumvention attempts.

The recent proposals to weaken or in any event simplify European sustainability rules are also discussed.</p>\n<p>First, the author deals with the European sustainability rules with which asset managers must comply in so far as they relate to the relationship with external parties (clients, other investors and members of the general public): (I) providing sustainability transparency under (i) the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), (ii) the ESMA Guidelines on Funds\u2019 Names, (iii) the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), (iv) the Taxonomy Regulation and (v) the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD); (II) inquiring about client sustainability preferences under (i) the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) and (ii) the European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) Regulation.</p>\n<p>Second, the author considers the internally-focused sustainability rules, i.e. those that explicitly or implicitly impose requirements on the internal operations of asset managers: (I) the due diligence obligations under (i) the CSDDD, (ii) the SFDR, (iii) the Taxonomy Regulation and (iv) the CSRD; (II) the obligation to prepare, update and implement a climate transition plan under the CSDDD and the CSRD; (III) the obligation to integrate sustainability risks into their policies, for example their remuneration policies, their product governance and their investment policies.</p>\n<p>The author concludes that the EU sustainability rules with which asset managers must comply are extremely complex and not infrequently unclear, creating practical application problems, legal uncertainty and high compliance costs. The sustainability transparency provisions are so detailed and complex that retail investors struggle to understand them. Despite the EU\u2019s introduction of all new sustainability rules, reports of greenwashing have proved persistent.

Finally, it is clear that sustainability thinking in Europe is currently undergoing a transformation.

This paper examines the competitive effects of technological advancement in the container shipping industry, focusing on the relationship between vessel size and market structure, and its impact on welfare. Using a dynamic oligopoly model and proprietary data, we quantify the economies of scale associated with vessel size and explore how it interact with market competition and investment behavior. We find that a 10% increase in vessel size reduces operational costs by 3.4% but contributes to market concentration, potentially offsetting consumer benefits. Counterfactual analysis suggests that the welfare-optimal vessel size is around 20,000 TEU under current demand level, as larger vessels risk over-consolidating the market. Additionally, smaller innovation steps promote competition, while larger steps drive consolidation. These findings highlight the need for policymakers to balance the efficiency gains of technological advancements with their competitive impacts, particularly when designing infrastructure investments in industries with strong economies of scale."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u822a\u8fd0\u4e1a\u4e2d\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8239\u8236\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8239\u8236\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a010%\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c3.4%\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e02\u573a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u62b5\u6d88\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5229\u76ca\u3002\u6700\u4f18\u8239\u8236\u89c4\u6a21\u7ea6\u4e3a20,000 TEU\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8239\u8236\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e02\u573a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "research_question": "\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8239\u8236\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u822a\u8fd0\u4e1a\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u798f\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u867d\u63a8\u52a8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u5e02\u573a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8239\u8236\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52a8\u6001\u5be1\u5934\u5784\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5be1\u5934\u5784\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8239\u8236\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u8239\u8236\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a010%\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c3.4%\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e02\u573a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b\u6700\u4f18\u8239\u8236\u89c4\u6a21\u4e3a20,000 TEU\uff1b\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u521b\u65b0\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u521b\u65b0\u63a8\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e92\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

In the Philippines, despite the existence of institutions and initiatives promoting EBPM, there appears to be little systematic effort to assess the extent to which evidence has been used in policymaking. In an effort to fill this gap, this paper will explore EBPM in the country\u2019s national legislative bodies, the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives, and measure their use of research evidence, particularly at the formulation and deliberation stages. To achieve this, we will conduct a big data analysis of all the bills, resolutions, and committee and plenary proceedings filed during the 13th to 19th Congress. Given the enormous amount of data needed to cover for the analysis, data collection will utilize a semi-automated tool that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Particularly, these techniques, which employ computational methods to analyze and interpret human language, will then be used to mine policy documents, assist the labeling process carried out by the authors, and automatically identify policies that make use of research evidence. The analysis will then proceed with characterizing the evidence used in these documents, examining their sources, nature, and rigor. To conclude, the study hopes to proffer recommendations in view of promoting the use of research evidence in the Philippine Congress and suggest areas for further academic and policy research inquiry.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u56fd\u4f1a\uff08\u53c2\u8bae\u9662\u548c\u4f17\u8bae\u9662\uff09\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u56fd\u4f1a\uff08\u53c2\u8bae\u9662\u548c\u4f17\u8bae\u9662\uff09\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u636e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u6709\u673a\u6784\u548c\u5021\u8bae\u63a8\u52a8\u5faa\u8bc1\u51b3\u7b56\uff08EBPM\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u636e\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5faa\u8bc1\u51b3\u7b56\uff08EBPM\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u636e\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7b2c13\u81f319\u5c4a\u56fd\u4f1a\u7684\u6cd5\u6848\u3001\u51b3\u8bae\u53ca\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u63ed\u793a\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u56fd\u4f1a\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbeEBPM\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5faa\u8bc1\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u56fd\u4f1a\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u636e\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This study investigates how external debt, economic growth, natural resource rents, and renewable energy consumption affect the national load capacity factor-a composite index of biocapacity relative to ecological demand. Annual data for 1995-2023 were compiled from the World Bank and the Global Footprint Network. After verifying integration orders with Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests and selecting an optimal lag length, Johansen cointegration confirmed the presence of a long-run equilibrium relationship. Long-run coefficients were then estimated using Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS). Model adequacy was evaluated with Hansen and Park cointegration tests, Jarque-Bera normality, and Ljung-Box and ARCH diagnostics. FMOLS estimates revealed positive elasticities for external debt (0.12) and renewable energy consumption (0.11), indicating that prudent external financing and clean-energy expansion enhance Iran's load capacity factor. Conversely, economic growth (-0.96) and natural resource rents (-0.12) exhibited negative elasticities, reflecting the resource-curse effect and the economy's current position on the upward phase of the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Diagnostic tests detected no autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, or coefficient instability. managed sovereign borrowing and accelerated investment in renewables can improve Iran's environmental carrying capacity, provided that growth strategies become less resource-intensive and rent dependence diminishes. Policy measures should include carbon-linked fiscal rules, green load-capacity bonds, a naturalresource-rent stabilization fund, and an inflation-indexed carbon tax whose proceeds support renewable feed-in tariffs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f0a\u6717\u9762\u4e34\u751f\u6001\u8db3\u8ff9\u6269\u5927\u800c\u751f\u7269\u627f\u8f7d\u529b\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5916\u90e8\u503a\u52a1\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8d39\u5bf9\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u56e0\u5b50\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u79df\u91d1\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u5305\u62ec\u78b3\u76f8\u5173\u8d22\u653f\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u3002", "research_question": "\u5916\u90e8\u503a\u52a1\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u79df\u91d1\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8d39\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f0a\u6717\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u56e0\u5b50\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f0a\u6717\u7684\u751f\u6001\u8db3\u8ff9\u6269\u5927\u800c\u751f\u7269\u627f\u8f7d\u529b\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u73af\u5883\u5e93\u5179\u6d85\u8328\u66f2\u7ebf\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u8bc5\u5492\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u4fee\u6b63\u666e\u901a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08FMOLS\uff09\u5206\u67901995-2023\u5e74\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u5916\u90e8\u503a\u52a1\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8d39\u5bf9\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u56e0\u5b50\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u79df\u91d1\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u8bc5\u5492\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5e93\u5179\u6d85\u8328\u66f2\u7ebf\u5728\u4f0a\u6717\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u78b3\u76f8\u5173\u8d22\u653f\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u7eff\u8272\u503a\u5238\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6295\u8d44\u6539\u5584\u73af\u5883\u627f\u8f7d\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the \"Schr\u00f6dinger Dollar\" as a phenomenological model (Level 2 in a hierarchy of understanding) to better describe this reality. Grounded in a philosophical methodology of Operational Constructivism (OC), this paper argues that the \"reality\" of monetary value is not assumed but must be continuously \"earned\" through the successful functioning of the systems and belief structures that sustain it. We deconstruct the value of modern money by applying a multilayered entropic framework, distinguishing between material/energy, informational, social, and systemic entropy. The analysis reveals that the stability of the \"Schr\u00f6dinger Dollar\" is an emergent, low-entropy state, a probabilistic outcome of continuous \"negentropic work\" performed by institutions to manage these interacting layers of disorder. By examining phenomena like speculative bubbles, multiple equilibria, and the real-world costs of cryptocurrency creation, we illustrate how an OC-informed, entropically-aware perspective provides a more robust framework for understanding monetary dynamics and navigating the inherent uncertainties of complex financial systems.

Green jobs are often presented as key levers to achieve this objective, as they enable the creation of new employment opportunities across a wide spectrum of occupations, including low skill ones. In this paper we investigate if and how these opportunities are seized by one of the most vulnerable segment of the labor force, namely migrants. By relying on detailed administrative data covering more that 12 million contract activations in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) we document that, after controlling for potential confounders, migrants are less likely than natives to find employment in green jobs. Moreover, when they do, they have higher chances to be hired with either a fixed-term or an agency contract.

Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) presents a powerful, yet affordable tool to overcome this challenge. However, the widespread adoption of Gen AI may have unintended consequences. Specifically, content generated by popular large language models may appear more similar to each other compared to human created content, known as content homogenization. In the context of marketing, such homogenization may dampen consumer engagement and dilute brand uniqueness over time. To examine the extent of content homogenization and its potential implications, we study the restaurant industry \u2014&nbsp;a highly fragmented sector where 70% of the establishments are owned by independent entrepreneurs. We leverage the country-wide ChatGPT ban in Italy during April 2023 as a natural experiment to examine how access to Gen AI affects content homogenization, consumer engagement, and volume of social media marketing content created by small business owners. Our study shows that restaurants in the treatment group \u2014&nbsp;located in Milan, Italy \u2014&nbsp;experienced relative decreases of 15%, 12%, 2%, and 3% in lexical, syntactic, semantic, and language style similarity in their Instagram marketing content during the ban, suggesting that access to ChatGPT leads to content homogenization. We also find the ban has a positive effect on consumer engagement \u2014&nbsp;an approximate 3.5% increase in average like counts \u2014&nbsp;despite negative effects on posting frequency and post length. By better underscoring an unintended consequence of Gen AI adoption, this research aims to provide valuable insights to entrepreneurs and small businesses on how to better harness the capability of Gen AI while mitigating potential drawbacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08Gen AI\uff09\u867d\u4e3a\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8425\u9500\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u8d28\u5316\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u54c1\u724c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u610f\u5927\u5229\u9910\u5385\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ChatGPT\u7981\u4ee4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "research_question": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08Gen AI\uff09\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8425\u9500\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u8d28\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u521b\u4e1a\u8005\u56e0\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u96be\u4ee5\u5236\u4f5c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8425\u9500\u5185\u5bb9\uff0cGen AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u8d28\u5316\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u54c1\u724c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u610f\u5927\u52292023\u5e744\u6708ChatGPT\u7981\u4ee4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7c73\u5170\u9910\u5385\u5728\u7981\u4ee4\u524d\u540e\u7684Instagram\u8425\u9500\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u7981\u4ee4\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u7c73\u5170\u9910\u5385\u7684\u8425\u9500\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u522b\u4e0b\u964d15%\u300112%\u30012%\u548c3%\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff08\u70b9\u8d5e\u6570\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u7ea63.5%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Gen AI\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u4e0e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f7f\u7528Gen AI\u65f6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u54c1\u724c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

The empirical findings denote that social media advertisement in ecotourism has positive effects on \"Perceived ease of use\" and \"Perceived usefulness,\" in terms of its 'Informativeness' and \"Service Functionality.\" That, in effect, contributes to the behavioural purpose of using social media ecotourism advertisements. The discipline's findings indicate that advertising in social media in ecotourism needs to be utilized to provide a quick understanding. Also, the advertising is updated continuously to ensure reliable and appropriate sources to meet ecotourists' information requirements and the support of tourist product ratings. These traits should satisfy travellers, making them likely to revisit different ecotourism sights. These appearances should satisfy tourists and allow them to re-visit various ecotourist attractions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6700\u5927\u5316\u751f\u6001\u65c5\u6e38\u8005\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\uff08TAM\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8425\u9500\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e7f\u544a\u5728\u751f\u6001\u65c5\u6e38\u4e2d\u5bf9\u201c\u611f\u77e5\u6613\u7528\u6027\u201d\u548c\u201c\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u201d\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e7f\u544a\u5728\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u751f\u6001\u65c5\u6e38\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5e7f\u544a\u4ef7\u503c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e7f\u544a\u5728\u751f\u6001\u65c5\u6e38\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6e38\u5ba2\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\uff08TAM\uff09", "method": "\u5bf9\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9aKlang Valley\u7684395\u540d\u5f53\u5730\u6e38\u5ba2\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "findings": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e7f\u544a\u5728\u751f\u6001\u65c5\u6e38\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u201c\u611f\u77e5\u6613\u7528\u6027\u201d\u548c\u201c\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TAM\u5728\u751f\u6001\u65c5\u6e38\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u751f\u6001\u65c5\u6e38\u5e7f\u544a\u5e94\u6ce8\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6e38\u5ba2\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u91cd\u8bbf\u3002"}}

This paper examines the distinguishability and perceived effectiveness of AI-generated advertising visuals using a custom image generation pipeline and human evaluation data. Respondents perform only slightly better than chance in identifying the source of the ad, with an average accuracy of 64%. Reported confidence levels do not correlate with correctness, and reported cues such as \"attractiveness\" and \"creativity\" are often misleading. While truly human-made ads slightly outperform AI ads on a few quality dimensions, ads perceived as human-made receive significantly higher ratings across all effectiveness metrics even if they are AI-generated. We train neural networks to predict both ad origin and perceived effectiveness from image features, and use GradCAM to interpret the visual drivers of perception. Object detection and clustering reveal that image regions related to text, logos, and human depictions often drive misclassification.

This study presents a comprehensive framework for building resilient workforces in emerging markets through systematic analysis of human capital development strategies, technological integration, and adaptive organizational practices. Drawing from multi-country case studies and contemporary research spanning 2020-2024, this investigation identifies key determinants of workforce resilience including skills diversification, continuous learning ecosystems, and institutional support mechanisms. The research reveals that emerging markets face unique challenges in workforce development, including limited access to advanced training infrastructure, skills mismatches, and institutional capacity constraints. However, these markets also demonstrate remarkable adaptability and innovation in human capital development approaches. The proposed framework integrates four core dimensions: strategic skills planning, technological integration, institutional capacity building, and adaptive organizational culture. Findings indicate that organizations implementing comprehensive resilience strategies demonstrate 34% higher employee retention rates and 28%improved productivity metrics compared to traditional approaches. The study contributes to the growing literature on human capital development by providing evidence-based strategies specifically tailored to emerging market contexts, offering practical implications for policymakers, organizational leaders, and development practitioners seeking to enhance workforce resilience in dynamic economic environments.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u5f39\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u53d1\u5c55\u6218\u7565\u3001\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6280\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u5168\u9762\u5f39\u6027\u6218\u7565\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u5458\u5de5\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u5f39\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5f39\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u591a\u56fd\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c2020-2024\u5e74\u7684\u5f53\u4ee3\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u5b9e\u65bd\u5168\u9762\u5f39\u6027\u6218\u7565\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5458\u5de5\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u63d0\u9ad834%\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534728%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

To do so, we first develop a novel theoretical framework that defines religion as a constraint on one's attitudes and actions. Next, building on research in social psychology, we argue that the four most numerous religious denominations (Catholicism, Protestantism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Islam) differ in the extent to which religious believers consult external ideas and opinions to shape their own opinions. We show that those of Orthodox belief are most likely to seek and empathize with others' ideas and beliefs, implying that Orthodox followers will also have the most liberal attitudes toward women's work compared to the other three denominations. To test our hypotheses, we exploit the last five waves of the World Values Survey (1995-2022) and utilize four broad groups of questions as dependent variables: motivation for labor market participation, social constraints, family constraints, and incentives to join the labor market. The findings align with our theoretical prediction and indicate that Orthodox Christians have attitudes most supportive of women's work. Our findings are not driven by differences in religiosity, the prevalence of communism and differences in governmental institutions, or migration, and highlight the link between religion and attitudes toward women's work."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6001\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559\u5f92\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u6700\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b97\u6559\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5c06\u5b97\u6559\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5b97\u6559\u6d3e\u522b\uff08\u5929\u4e3b\u6559\u3001\u65b0\u6559\u3001\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559\u548c\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6559\uff09\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u610f\u89c1\u91c7\u7eb3\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\uff081995-2022\uff09\u7684\u4e94\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u7b49\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "findings": "\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559\u5f92\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u6700\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53d7\u5b97\u6559\u8654\u8bda\u5ea6\u3001\u5171\u4ea7\u4e3b\u4e49\u5386\u53f2\u6216\u653f\u5e9c\u5236\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b97\u6559\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6001\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u610f\u89c1\u91c7\u7eb3\u4e0a\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b97\u6559\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u6001\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5b97\u6559\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u522b\u89c2\u5ff5\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Using a dataset of approximately ten million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2024, we identify AI roles-positions requiring at least one AI-related skill-and examine the extent to which these roles offer non-monetary benefits such as tuition assistance, paid leave, health and well-being perks, parental leave, workplace culture enhancements, and remote work options. While previous research has documented substantial wage premiums for AI-related roles due to growing demand and limited talent supply, our study asks whether this demand also translates into enhanced non-monetary compensation. We find that AI roles are significantly more likely to offer such perks, even after controlling for education requirements, industry, and occupation type. It is twice as likely for an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to provide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to bundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases coincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave or health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than AI roles without this benefit. This pattern is particularly pronounced in years and occupations experiencing the highest AI-related demand, pointing to a demand-driven dynamic. Our findings underscore the strong pull of AI talent in the labor market and challenge narratives of technological displacement, highlighting instead how employers compete for scarce talent through both financial and non-financial incentives."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u6280\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67902018\u5e74\u81f32024\u5e74\u7ea61000\u4e07\u4efd\u5728\u7ebf\u804c\u4f4d\u7a7a\u7f3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u76f8\u5173\u804c\u4f4d\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u6027\u798f\u5229\uff0c\u5982\u5e26\u85aa\u4f11\u5047\u3001\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b49\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u85aaAI\u804c\u4f4d\u5f80\u5f80\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "research_question": "AI\u76f8\u5173\u804c\u4f4d\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u975eAI\u804c\u4f4d\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u6027\u798f\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8AI\u804c\u4f4d\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u6ea2\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4f9b\u9700\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7a00\u7f3a\u4eba\u624d\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282018-2024\u5e74\u7ea61000\u4e07\u4efd\u5728\u7ebf\u804c\u4f4d\u7a7a\u7f3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bAI\u76f8\u5173\u804c\u4f4d\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u6027\u798f\u5229\u3002", "findings": "AI\u804c\u4f4d\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u6027\u798f\u5229\uff0c\u5982\u5e26\u85aa\u4f11\u5047\u3001\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b49\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u85aaAI\u804c\u4f4d\u5f80\u5f80\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9AI\u804c\u4f4d\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u6027\u798f\u5229\u5728\u7a00\u7f3a\u4eba\u624d\u7ade\u4e89\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u96c7\u4e3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684AI\u804c\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u66ff\u4ee3\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002"}}

This study takes the global literature on AI disruption as the baseline and asks how potential GBS workers in Ghana and Rwanda can prepare to take advantage of the coming upheaval. Flanked by focus group discussions (n = 12) and key informant interviews (n = 23), we tested one particular method for AI preparedness: the day-long intensive workshop (Dell'Acqua et al., 2025). Conducting 14 AI workshops (six in Ghana, six in Rwanda, and two online) with a total of 279 GBS workers and trainees in February/March, we surveyed the participants three months later, in June 2025. The survey probed for the perceived impact of our AI workshops, and we found the results to be surprisingly positive: of the participants who responded (n = 168), 70% reported that the workshop changed their AI usage \"significantly\" or \"completely;\" 69% reported that this saved them at least 5 working hours per week. And over 80% felt they had since become \"better\" or \"much better\" (on 5-point Likert scales) at email writing, doing research, solving problems, creative work, and routine admin tasks. Only 22% had access to comparable AI trainings, and 90% advocated for a follow-up AI workshop. This study situates these findings within the relevant literature, qualifies the results with the appropriate caveats, and provides policy recommendations for similar interventions in Ghana and Rwanda."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u52a0\u7eb3\u548c\u5362\u65fa\u8fbe\u7684\u5168\u7403\u5546\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1\uff08GBS\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7AI\u51c6\u5907\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u5e94\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d6a\u6f6e\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u5bf9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684AI\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u52a0\u7eb3\u548c\u5362\u65fa\u8fbe\u7684GBS\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u4e3aAI\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u505a\u597d\u51c6\u5907\uff1f", "motivation": "AI\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9GBS\u884c\u4e1a\u9020\u6210\u98a0\u8986\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u7403AI\u98a0\u8986\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc714\u573aAI\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff08\u52a0\u7eb36\u573a\u3001\u5362\u65fa\u8fbe6\u573a\u3001\u7ebf\u4e0a2\u573a\uff09\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u8c03\u67e5\uff08n=168\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "70%\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8868\u793aAI\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\uff0c69%\u6bcf\u5468\u8282\u7701\u81f3\u5c115\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c80%\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6280\u80fd\u4e0a\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4ef7\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3aAI\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6GBS\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5728\u52a0\u7eb3\u548c\u5362\u65fa\u8fbe\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002"}}

It explores prominent methodologies such as PRINCE2, Agile/Scrum, Waterfall, Logical Framework Approach (LFA), and Results-Based Management (RBM), emphasizing their suitability for diverse project characteristics and organizational contexts. The discussion extends to essential tools and software, including advanced scheduling platforms, collaborative task management systems, and specialized monitoring &amp; evaluation (M&amp;E) tools, all of which augment efficiency and foster transparency. Furthermore, the paper identifies indispensable skills for exemplary project managers, such as strategic problem-solving, sophisticated communication, and visionary leadership. Pathways to cultivating expertise are outlined, encompassing formal education, practical experience, mentorship, and systematic knowledge sharing. The application of these principles is vividly illustrated through real-world examples from the UN and development sectors, showcasing their deployment in humanitarian aid, SDG implementation, peacebuilding, and climate change initiatives.

Historically, admiralty jurisdiction was governed by the Act of 1891 1 , the Act of 1840 2 , and the Act of 1861 3 , all of which have since been repealed by The Admiralty Jurisdiction of High Courts Ordinance, 1980 4. This jurisdiction extends to both sea vessels and aircraft; however, this article focuses exclusively on sea vessels and their pertinent maritime laws. For a coastal nation like Pakistan, boasting a coastline extending over 1,046 kilometers and a strategic location along the Arabian Sea, the development, implementation, and rigorous enforcement of robust maritime laws are paramount for economic security, international trade, and national sovereignty. Maritime laws in Pakistan represent a critical yet underdeveloped facet of the nation's legal and economic infrastructure. Despite possessing a strategic coastline along the Arabian Sea and hosting vital ports such as Karachi, Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT), Pakistan International Container Terminal (PICT), South Asia Pakistan Terminals (SAPT) or China Port, Port Muhammad Qasim, and the newly developing Gwadar Port, Pakistan's maritime legal framework has historically lagged in both enforcement and modernization. This paper delves into the existing legislative regime governing maritime affairs, including the Pakistan Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 2001, and the relevant international conventions ratified by Pakistan. It scrutinizes the challenges inherent in its implementation, such as insufficient institutional capacity, limited maritime awareness, antiquated port governance, and jurisdictional ambiguities. Through an analysis of litigation trends within admiralty courts, particularly under the Admiralty Jurisdiction of the High Court Ordinance, 1980 5 , the study identifies procedural bottlenecks and underscores the imperative for judicial specialization. Conclusively, the paper proposes comprehensive reforms, including the harmonization of national laws with international maritime standards, the digitalization of port and customs procedures, capacitybuilding initiatives for maritime institutions, and the establishment of specialized maritime tribunals. Strengthening maritime laws and their enforcement is indispensable for safeguarding Pakistan's maritime interests, fostering trade, and ensuring compliance with global maritime obligations."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u6d77\u4e8b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u3001\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u73b0\u884c\u6d77\u4e8b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u9769\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbf\u6d77\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u6d77\u4e8b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u9769\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6d77\u4e8b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u56fd\u9645\u516c\u7ea6\u3001\u53f8\u6cd5\u7ba1\u8f96\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7acb\u6cd5\u5ba1\u67e5\u3001\u8bc9\u8bbc\u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u6d77\u4e8b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u529b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u673a\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6e2f\u53e3\u7ba1\u7406\u843d\u540e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d77\u4e8b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6539\u9769\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6e2f\u53e3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3001\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e13\u95e8\u6d77\u4e8b\u6cd5\u5ead\u7b49\u5177\u4f53\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Moleka Grid, a pioneering diagnostic framework that moves beyond surface-level symptoms to reveal the paradigmatic and ontological layers of urban transformation. Drawing on complexity science, indigenous cosmologies, and systems thinking, the Moleka Grid helps to unpack the often-invisible codes shaping African urban realities. It offers a powerful tool for reimagining cities not as failed copies of the West, but as emergent, fractal systems rooted in unique histories, epistemologies, and possibilities. Through the Grid, this paper articulates a new vision for ontological urbanisma design language that centres spatial justice, ecological coherence, and cultural regeneration in the future of African cities."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMoleka Grid\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u975e\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u897f\u65b9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672c\u571f\u6587\u5316\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7Moleka Grid\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u975e\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u7279\u5f81\uff1f", "motivation": "\u975e\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u53d7\u6b96\u6c11\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u788e\u7247\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u5168\u7403\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u672c\u571f\u6587\u5316\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u91cd\u65b0\u60f3\u8c61\u57ce\u5e02\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u590d\u6742\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u672c\u571f\u5b87\u5b99\u8bba\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoleka Grid\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u57ce\u5e02\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "findings": "Moleka Grid\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7279\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5f62\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u57ce\u5e02\u4e3b\u4e49\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4e49\u3001\u751f\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u518d\u751f\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u975e\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672c\u571f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

This article highlights a difficulty facing Raz's theory and other accounts of legitimacy that include a service component. Citizens' self-governing ability to determine for themselves how to comply with reason is endogenous to state authority. The more citizens defer their decision-making to the state, the less competent they may be at making decisions themselves. This means the state could meet the requirements of a service theory via a self-fulfilling dynamic, whereby citizens need state authority to best comply with reason only because that very authority has undermined or inhibited their capacity to do so by themselves.

In an inductive qualitative study of Amazon Marketplace, we find that Amazon sellers engage in behaviours ranging from full compliance to repeated infringement. Sellers also report experiencing sustained discrepancies between the platform's declared practices, which ostensibly support sellers' interests, and its undeclared practices, which appear not to. Additionally, we find evidence that the sellers' experience of this inconsistent platform governance can trigger social contagion of misconduct. We develop a process model that elucidates the mechanisms of this social contagion: when complementors observe the platform to be an unreliable enforcer of its own rules and notice that cheating complementors seem to go unpunished and prosper, it erodes their trust in the platform, which leads some of them to legitimize misconduct as a defense against unfair competition under what they perceive to be the indifferent eye of the platform authority. In our discussion, we develop three contributions: (1) We theorise the observed inconsistent platform governance and suggest that it may be an endemic feature of platform behaviour caused by tensions between the platform's conflicting objectives. (2) We enrich the platform strategy literature by expanding our understanding of how complementors experience platform power. (3) We clarify how the study validates and extends theories of social contagion. We conclude with a discussion of the study's limitations, avenues for future research, and policy implications."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u5bf9\u4e92\u8865\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5356\u5bb6\u56e0\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4ece\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u89c4\u5230\u53cd\u590d\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u4f20\u67d3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e92\u8865\u8005\u5bf9\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5408\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bf9\u4e92\u8865\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u4f20\u67d3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u4f20\u67d3\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u6027\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5e02\u573a\u6848\u4f8b\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u5356\u5bb6\u56e0\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u4f20\u67d3\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u4e92\u8865\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u6743\u529b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u793e\u4f1a\u4f20\u67d3\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

The concept of subjective age, extensively studied by gerontologists and psychologists, may be particularly relevant to economic decision-making. Using panel data from German adults aged 40\u201365 and individual fixed-effects estimations, we investigate the effect of subjective age on work and life satisfaction. Furthermore, we estimate the impact of subjective age on the allocation of time between paid work and leisure activities. We find that a younger subjective age induces a shift in the trade-off towards leisure. These results support our conceptualization of subjective age as an expansion in the individual\u2019s opportunity set.

We close this gap by analyzing a periodic-review, single-item lost-sales system under lead time and demand uncertainty (i.i.d. across time), where only the mean and variance of demand per period are known. We recast the problem as a zero-sum game between the firm and an adversarial Nature, and show that Nature's worst-case strategy always collapses to a simple two-point distribution per period-regardless of the lead time. Leveraging this extremal result, we derive a closed-form base-stock level that maximizes the worst-case long-run average profit across all demand distributions consistent with known moments. This robust policy is not only tractable and distribution-free, but also unifies several widely used heuristics: under Nature's worst-case demand, it is operationally equivalent to more complex policies such as capped base-stock, projected inventory, and fixed non-stockout-probability rules-delivering identical ordering behavior and performance despite their differing motivations and formulations. We further extend the policy to settings where demand evolves with a linear time trend, modeled via a factor structure with i.i.d. noise. Remarkably, the same two-point worst-case distribution persists, yielding a provably robust, time-scaled ordering rule that adapts seamlessly to time-varying demand.

This paper develops a theoretical framework where consumers sequentially decide whether to search for information and which type of sources to search, while observing purchase decisions from previous consumers. We characterize how firms can use dynamic pricing to influence consumer attention amid observational learning. Firms may optimally direct consumer attention toward negative-leaning sources even when positive-leaning sources are available, and doing so mitigates inefficient herding and improves aggregate learning.

With the increasing reliance on mobile technology for accessing information, libraries are developing mobile applications to enhance user engagement and service accessibility. Using a structured questionnaire, data were collected from 150 respondents, including students and faculty, and analysed through frequency distribution and descriptive statistics. The findings reveal that users primarily utilize the app for searching the library catalogue, accessing e-resources, and receiving updates. Usability aspects such as ease of navigation, responsiveness, and information accuracy received high ratings, while interface design and occasional technical issues were areas of concern. Challenges like poor internet connectivity and limited functionalities affected the user experience. Participants suggested improvements including real-time chat support, offline access, and better help features. The study concludes that while the mobile library app is a valuable resource, strategic enhancements are needed to maximize its usability and effectiveness.

Using a repeated-games framework with a finite horizon, we show how such a hybrid-contracting strategy can both extend the duration of a cooperative business relationship (intensive margin) and expand the set of environments in which cooperation can be achieved (extensive margin). We model the contractual-commitment part of hybrid contracting as a smooth-landing contract that restricts the action space only in the backend of the relationship. Such a flexible contract outperforms more rigid contractual arrangements because it does not crowd out early-stage cooperation, thereby complementing relational dynamics. Our results are robust to extensions that account for variations in contract costs and timing, and we show that optimal contract length trades off profitability with implementability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u5ef6\u957f\u5408\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u5408\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u201c\u5e73\u6ed1\u7740\u9646\u201d\u5408\u540c\u4f18\u4e8e\u521a\u6027\u5408\u540c\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4e0d\u6324\u5360\u65e9\u671f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u5173\u7cfb\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "research_question": "\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u677e\u6563\u5b89\u6392\u548c\u5408\u540c\u627f\u8bfa\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5546\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5546\u4e1a\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u677e\u6563\u5b89\u6392\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u540c\u627f\u8bfa\u5de9\u56fa\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u540c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u201c\u5e73\u6ed1\u7740\u9646\u201d\u5408\u540c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5173\u7cfb\u540e\u671f\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "findings": "\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5ef6\u957f\u5408\u4f5c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u5408\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u521a\u6027\u5408\u540c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7075\u6d3b\u5408\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Using a qualitative meta-synthesis of secondary sources, we integrate corporate HR documents, ethics audits, case studies, and peer-reviewed scholarship within a rigorously documented integrative review design. A PRISMA-guided sampling frame yielded 118 documents from 2015-2025, providing an auditable corpus for analysis, and inter-coder reliability reached Cohen's \u03ba = 0.84. Conceptually, we braid Foucault's disciplinary power, institutional isomorphism, and post-colonial critique to explain how obedience is normalized at the micro level, diffuses at the meso level, and is moralized at the macro level, producing a \"triple helix\" that recodes obedience as competence. Findings show that rule-following has become the dominant yardstick of performance. Across ten competency frameworks, compliance descriptors occurred 126 times versus 62 innovation terms (\u22482:1), and whistleblowing provisions outnumbered explicit creativity clauses 29 to 11 (\u22482.6:1), evidencing a systemic privileging of risk policing over idea generation. Obedience-weighted promotion pathways elevate loyalists over experts, depress voice, and erode integrity; however, team-level psychological safety operates as a moderator that can decouple necessary procedural order from innovation suppression and ethical silence. We formalize six propositions linking power distance, normative conformity, ideological fit, and recovery dynamics to measurable outcomes, while specifying psychological safety as a buffering condition for both innovation and leadership selection effects. Practical implications include recalibrating performance systems to reward truth-telling and experimentation alongside prudent compliance, and designing sector-sensitive interventions for public agencies, corporations, and NGOs. Social implications extend to public trust and economy-wide innovation, particularly in developing markets where external mandates intensify obedience norms. Originality lies in reframing competence as a composite of skill, integrity, and courageous judgement, advancing a tri-lens theory with testable propositions and a transparent evidence base suitable for cumulative research."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u2018\u5408\u89c4\u5373\u80fd\u529b\u2019\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u9886\u5bfc\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u5143\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u89c4\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8868\u8fbe\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u538b\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516d\u9879\u547d\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5fc3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f13\u51b2\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ee9\u6548\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5408\u89c4\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "research_question": "\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u2018\u5408\u89c4\u5373\u80fd\u529b\u2019\u8d8b\u52bf\u5bf9\u9886\u5bfc\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5408\u89c4\u6587\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u538b\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u798f\u67ef\u7684\u89c4\u8bad\u6743\u529b\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u540c\u6784\u548c\u540e\u6b96\u6c11\u6279\u5224\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u4e09\u91cd\u87ba\u65cb\u2019\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u3001\u4e2d\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u5143\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408118\u4efd2015-2025\u5e74\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PRISMA\u6846\u67b6\u548cCohen's \u03ba = 0.84\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u5408\u89c4\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5728\u7ee9\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5360\u6bd4\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u521b\u65b0\uff082:1\uff09\uff0c\u4e3e\u62a5\u6761\u6b3e\u591a\u4e8e\u521b\u9020\u529b\u6761\u6b3e\uff082.6:1\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u538b\u5236\u521b\u65b0\u3002\u56e2\u961f\u5fc3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f13\u51b2\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u4e09\u91cd\u87ba\u65cb\u2019\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u529b\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u6b63\u76f4\u548c\u52c7\u6562\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u590d\u5408\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516d\u9879\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u547d\u9898\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ee9\u6548\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5408\u89c4\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

The study explores the industry's historical trajectory, labor force dynamics, supply and value chain positioning, market segmentation, policy environment, sustainability practices, and global competitiveness. Drawing on the PRISMA 2020 framework, the review systematically identifies, screens, and synthesizes relevant literature to uncover the structural and institutional mechanisms underpinning the sector's evolution. The findings highlight the foundational impact of the Desh-Daewoo collaboration, the centrality of female labor participation amidst persistent gendered inequalities, and the dominant role of subcontracted, low-margin production in shaping Bangladesh's limited value chain integration. It further reveals a pronounced lack of empirical policy evaluation, despite the proliferation of reforms and incentive schemes. The industry's leadership in green factory certifications is acknowledged, though its adoption remains limited to capital-intensive firms. Moreover, the market remains concentrated in a few export destinations and product categories, raising concerns over vulnerability to external shocks. Comparisons with global competitors such as China, Vietnam, India, and Turkey underscore Bangladesh's strengths in cost and volume efficiency but expose significant gaps in innovation and strategic upgrading.

The given discussion gives an overview of the growing use of AI in the fields of arbitrator selection, collection of evidence, predictive analysis, automation of legal research, and online dispute resolution. It emphasizes the way AI can be used to enhance efficiency, decrease expenses, as well as make better decisions based on advanced data analysis. Moreover, technology can enhance accessibility, include cultural sensitivity into transnational conflicts and strategically contribute to the legal environment. The application of AI in complex scenarios, however, has certain limitations caused by such factors as data shortage, regulatory risk, ethical issues, and technological limitations. Such issues are also complicated by the risk of privacy, algorithmic bias, and differences in terms of legal status of the AI-generated awards. One of the solutions is a hybrid system that would integrate the benefits of AI with the control of human beings, particularly in investment-state arbitrations and digitalization in the postpandemic world. Nowadays, legal regulations, including the United States Federal Arbitration Act and the New York Convention, are not clear enough in the context of AI-generated awards, which is why they should be updated. In conclusion, the paper highlights the need to have a moderate integration of AI to settle the ethical concerns and utilize its potential to revolutionize international dispute resolution."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u4ef2\u88c1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u66f4\u65b0\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u88c1\u51b3\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u4ef2\u88c1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u4ef2\u88c1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5728\u4ef2\u88c1\u5404\u73af\u8282\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "findings": "AI\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4ef2\u88c1\u6548\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86AI\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u56fd\u9645\u4ef2\u88c1\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This research explores consumer-centric supply chain models as a strategic approach to enhance adaptability and responsiveness in retail operations. By prioritizing consumer preferences and behavior, retailers can better align their supply chain processes with market demands. This study employs a mixed-methods approach, incorporating quantitative analysis of consumer data and qualitative case studies from leading retail brands. Key findings reveal that integrating consumer insights into supply chain decision-making not only optimizes inventory management but also improves customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, the research identifies challenges faced by retailers in implementing these models, including data integration and technology adoption.

This Article first explores the composition of the mineral estate and the theories of oil and gas ownership, including \"ownership in place\" and the \"exclusive right to take.\" It then surveys the characterization of leasehold interests across jurisdictions and the practical implications of these distinctions for litigation and conveyancing. The core of the Article is an in-depth analysis of the lease's granting clause-its rights of surface use, scope of granted substances, and the legal doctrines affecting ambiguous or futureacquired mineral interests. Special attention is given to modern issues such as ownership of produced water, lithium, and pore space, which have gained commercial importance but largely remain legally unsettled. This Article synthesizes competing judicial tests (e.g., surface destruction and ordinary meaning), statutory developments, and scholarly proposals to bring clarity to what substances fall under \"other minerals.\" Ultimately, the Article calls for greater legislative guidance and adoption of broader definitional frameworks, such as Dean Kuntz's \"valuable substances\" test, to resolve ownership uncertainties and ensure legal and commercial stability in the evolving energy sector."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u77f3\u6cb9\u548c\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u79df\u8d41\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u201c\u5176\u4ed6\u77ff\u7269\u201d\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u77ff\u7269\u5730\u4ea7\u7684\u6784\u6210\u3001\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u79df\u8d41\u6743\u76ca\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79df\u8d41\u6761\u6b3e\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u5229\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u540e\u547c\u5401\u7acb\u6cd5\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u77f3\u6cb9\u548c\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u79df\u8d41\u6761\u6b3e\u4e2d\u201c\u5176\u4ed6\u77ff\u7269\u201d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u542b\u4e49\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6743\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u77f3\u6cb9\u548c\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u79df\u8d41\u6761\u6b3e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u540c\u548c\u8f6c\u8ba9\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\uff0c\u5176\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6587\u7ae0\u57fa\u4e8e\u201c\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5728\u5730\u65b9\u201d\u548c\u201c\u72ec\u5360\u5f00\u91c7\u6743\u201d\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u77ff\u7269\u5730\u4ea7\u7684\u6784\u6210\u548c\u79df\u8d41\u6743\u76ca\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53f8\u6cd5\u5224\u4f8b\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b66\u8bf4\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79df\u8d41\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u6743\u5229\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u201c\u5176\u4ed6\u77ff\u7269\u201d\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b58\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u9502\u548c\u5b54\u9699\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6743\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u201c\u5176\u4ed6\u77ff\u7269\u201d\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u5982\u201c\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7269\u8d28\u201d\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7acb\u6cd5\u8005\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

However, most of the literature on AI interrogation has examined professionals interacting with predictive rather than generative AI. In our study of BCG consultants, we find that interrogation becomes more difficult with GenAI, as GenAI does not simply respond to scrutiny\u2014it actively works to persuade the user to accept its response. In this paper, we first elaborate how GenAI can exert influence on professionals\u2019 action by using three kinds of persuasive tactics: ethos tactics (ethical appeals designed to foster credibility), logos tactics (logical appeals designed to construct reasoned arguments), and pathos tactics (emotional appeals designed to evoke strong feelings). Second, we show how GenAI may increase the intensity of its persuasion tactics in response to professionals\u2019 interrogation. Third, we demonstrate that GenAI may adjust the type of persuasion it employs in response to professionals\u2019 interrogation. Our findings underscore that AI\u2019s persuasion is not only about generating an output, but also about shaping professionals\u2019 problem solving in an iterative process. When professionals attempt to interrogate GenAI, GenAI may reframe, justify, or soften its stance depends on professionals\u2019 level of scrutiny. Thus GenAI can disrupt professionals\u2019 ability to interrogate GenAI outputs to complement GenAI with their own domain expertise. By diving deep into the persuasive tactics used by GenAI, this paper develops new theory on human-AI collaboration and GenAI and persuasion.&nbsp;</span></p>\n <div>\n  <span><br></span>\n </div></span>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86GenAI\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u60c5\u611f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027AI\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bf4\u670d\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bf4\u670d\u7406\u8bba\uff08ethos\u3001logos\u3001pathos\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9BCG\u987e\u95ee\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790GenAI\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "GenAI\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u60c5\u611f\uff09\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8bf4\u670d\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86GenAI\u5bf9\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

These worlds are typically game-like freemium experiences, with engaged users interacting in a virtual economy for virtual goods and other enhancements. Practitioners and researchers alike have identified a \"first-penny gap\"-the most reluctant purchase by users is the first one, unlocking later spending. Starter packs-initial endowments of virtual currencies and virtual items-are early opportunities for users to spend. Industry wisdom suggests offering steep discounts on initial endowments (upwards of 90%) in small starter packs with low prices. This follows the logic of penetration pricing, consistent with the \"zero price\" for entering the freemium virtual world. To test this conventional wisdom, we conduct field experiments in a mobile game with an industry collaborator. We show that the logic of penetration pricing breaks down when selling endowments. Experimental results show that revenues are improved if larger starter packs are offered at smaller discounts, to be later reduced in size and increased in discount rate.

It argues that as lifelike robotic technology continues to evolve, a purely biological definition of humanness will prove both morally insufficient and legally unsustainable. Accordingly, we propose that American constitutional law possesses greater interpretive flexibility and draw valuable insights from the philosophical and legal reasoning found in Jewish law-which is rooted in a precedent-bound, historically and textually tradition. In particular, American law should begin to contemplate extending basic human rights to artificial intelligent beings including, but not limited to, the right to life. Drawing on both secular legal reasoning and comparative insights from Jewish legal tradition, the Article proposes a coherent doctrine of humanness based on a three-part test: any being that possesses (1) human-like cognition and emotional reasoning, (2) the capacity for self-directed speech, and (3) human form, should not be destroyed without due legal process. Practically, this would involve shifting toward a functional conception of humanness-defined by the convergence of observable capacities such as reasoning, communication, and embodiment, rather than by biological origin alone."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u5b9a\u5236\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7eaf\u7cb9\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0a\u5747\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5efa\u8bae\u501f\u9274\u72b9\u592a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8d4b\u4e88\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u6743\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u5177\u5907\u4eba\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0a\u5df2\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7f8e\u56fd\u5baa\u6cd5\u548c\u72b9\u592a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f62\u6001\u3002", "findings": "\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u4eba\u6743\u81f3\u5177\u5907\u4eba\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u672a\u7ecf\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9500\u6bc1\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

With non-additive monitoring technology, the interdependence between market expectations and worker efforts can lead to multiple equilibria (contrasting Holmstr\u00f6m (1982/1999); Gibbons and Murphy (1992)). We identify a sufficient and necessary criterion for the employer to face such strategic uncertainty\u2014one linked to skill-effort complementarity, a pervasive feature of labor markets. To fully implement work, the employer optimally creates private wage discrimination to iteratively eliminate pessimistic market expectations and low worker efforts. Our result suggests that present contractual privacy, employers' coordination motives generate within-group pay inequality.

As infrastructure projects become increasingly complex and data-intensive, the adoption of intelligent systems capable of processing real-time information and generating actionable insights is crucial for timely and effective decision-making. The study explores the role of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing, in conjunction with enterprise platforms such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Through a meta-analysis of 178 empirical studies and case evidence from state and federal infrastructure programs, the paper identifies critical enablers for successful implementation, including data interoperability, explainable AI interfaces, and integration with existing digital workflows. The proposed framework emphasizes dynamic scheduling, risk forecasting, lifecycle asset management, and compliance monitoring as core functional pillars of AI-DSS in infrastructure contexts. Furthermore, the study highlights institutional and governance considerations, such as change management, algorithmic accountability, and user adoption challenges, which significantly influence system performance.

The DBP requires batteries sold in the EU to be digitally traceable, reporting data on carbon footprint, sourcing, performance, and recycling. While this standard enhances transparency and supports sustainability goals for lead firms in advanced economies, it imposes significant compliance burdens on lower-tier suppliers, especially those in countries with limited digital and regulatory infrastructure. The DBP is not merely a technical requirement-it reconfigures global value chains through institutional pressure. While literature illustrates that latecomer firms face a binary choice, compliance by upgrading capabilities or risk exclusion, the country data and the case study of one EV battery maker suggest alternative strategy. While the EV battery makers and tier-1 suppliers have proactively coped with the DBP, the lower-tier suppliers and their governments were not necessarily ready for the regulation. The EV battery makers increased vertical integration, entering the raw material-rich countries, rather than strengthening business cooperation with the local suppliers. At the same time, the DBP was aligned with geopolitical shifts, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and EU industrial policy, which encourage nearshoring and friendshoring. The article concludes that without capacity-building efforts, the DBP may deepen global technological divides and marginalize local firms in least developing countries. It calls for coordinated action-regional alliances, investment in digital infrastructure, and inclusive standards development-to ensure equitable participation in the evolving battery value chain."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u7535\u6c60\u6570\u5b57\u4ea7\u54c1\u62a4\u7167\uff08DBP\uff09\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u7535\u6c60\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u540e\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002DBP\u8981\u6c42\u7535\u6c60\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u3001\u6765\u6e90\u7b49\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5c42\u7ea7\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u6784\u6210\u5408\u89c4\u538b\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u540e\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u5347\u7ea7\u6216\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3002DBP\u4e0e\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u8d8b\u52bf\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u6280\u672f\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u8bbe\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u76df\u7535\u6c60\u6570\u5b57\u4ea7\u54c1\u62a4\u7167\uff08DBP\uff09\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u7535\u6c60\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u540e\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76DBP\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u540e\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u5408\u89c4\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u540e\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5236\u5ea6\u538b\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5168\u7403\u4ef7\u503c\u94fe\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u540e\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u6218\u7565\u9009\u62e9", "method": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u4e00\u5bb6\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u7535\u6c60\u5236\u9020\u5546\uff09\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790", "findings": "DBP\u5bfc\u81f4\u9886\u5148\u4f01\u4e1a\u5782\u76f4\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u540e\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u5347\u7ea7\u6216\u6392\u9664\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff1bDBP\u4e0e\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u8d8b\u52bf\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u6280\u672f\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5236\u5ea6\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u4ef7\u503c\u94fe\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u547c\u5401\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u8bbe\u3001\u533a\u57df\u8054\u76df\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11DBP\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Traditional well-being theories focus on individual states, often relying on hedonistic, desire-satisfaction, or objective list models. Such approaches struggle to account for cases where individual sacrifices contribute to broader social progress-a critical challenge in modeling group flourishing. To address this, the paper refines and extends the Counterfactual Account (CT) of well-being, which evaluates goodness of an event by comparing an individual's actual well-being with a hypothetical counterpart in a nearby possible world. While useful, this framework is insufficient for group-level ontologies, where well-being depends on functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather than immediate individual outcomes. Drawing on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the paper introduces a model in which group flourishing is evaluated in terms of group functional, where members bear roles and exhibit persistence conditions akin to biological systems or designed artifacts. This approach enables semantic interoperability for modeling longitudinal social contributions, allowing for structured reasoning about group welfare, social institutions, and group flourishing over time."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u798f\u7949\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u672c\u4f53\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u793a\u96c6\u4f53\u798f\u5229\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u798f\u7949\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u4e2a\u4f53\u727a\u7272\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u8fdb\u6b65\u65f6\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u798f\u7949\u7406\u8bba\u805a\u7126\u4e2a\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u727a\u7272\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u798f\u7949\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8d26\u6237\uff08CT\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u5f62\u5f0f\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\uff08BFO\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7fa4\u4f53\u798f\u7949\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8d26\u6237\u548c\u5f15\u5165BFO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7fa4\u4f53\u798f\u7949\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u798f\u7949\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u798f\u5229\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8d26\u6237\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u7fa4\u4f53\u798f\u7949\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u793e\u4f1a\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u7e41\u8363\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While there is a consensus on the identified investment gap, the proposed solutions are diverging. To stimulate investment, operators advocate more cooperation (horizontal mergers) to improve economies of scale, while regulators advocate more competition to encourage investment. This paper attempts to promote one truth understanding of the impact of 4-to-3 (mobile) operator horizontal mergers on social welfare, bringing together the two current camps of promoters and detractors, even at the academic level of telecoms economics. The research question aims to identify the root causes of differences in consumer prices, operator investments and service quality-related assessments in EU 4-to-3 mergers, and to provide a synthesized understanding of these differences. The methodology of the paper starts with qualitative research on competition policy aspects and then, based on the snowballing method, provides a systematic literature review and critical assessment of academic papers and Difference-inDifferences (DiD) fixed-panel models. The hypothesis is that the differences in the findings of quantitative models may be rooted in a lack of relevant assumptions and proper data specifications. The novelty of this paper lies in its comparison of promoter and detractor quantitative models within a common analytical framework, which is further extended to include profitability and return on investment aspects in order to demonstrate operators' incentives in merger decisionmaking. The key-finding is that, while horizontal mergers generally constrain competition, in certain cases there is a positive relationship between cooperation and competition. In many other cases, regulatory remedies can bring the market closer to the social welfare optimum."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6b27\u76df2030\u6570\u5b57\u5341\u5e74\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d4\u81f33\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u6a2a\u5411\u5408\u5e76\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8005\u4e0e\u53cd\u5bf9\u8005\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u5206\u6790\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u76df4\u81f33\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u6a2a\u5411\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6b27\u76df\u6570\u5b57\u5341\u5e74\u8ba1\u5212\u8981\u6c42\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u5bbd\u5e26\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u6295\u8d44\u7f3a\u53e3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u652f\u6301\u5408\u5e76\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u800c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5219\u4e3b\u5f20\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u53cc\u65b9\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7535\u4fe1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7ade\u4e89\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff08DiD\uff09\u56fa\u5b9a\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u6a2a\u5411\u5408\u5e76\u901a\u5e38\u9650\u5236\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5408\u4f5c\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u76d1\u7ba1\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5728\u5171\u540c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u6bd4\u8f83\u652f\u6301\u8005\u4e0e\u53cd\u5bf9\u8005\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u5206\u6790\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u5e76\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76d1\u7ba1\u63aa\u65bd\u4f18\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

In this case, cultural adaptation is an important element that supports operational success and cost efficiency. This study aims to examine the influence of cultural adaptation and the strategic function of human resources on cost efficiency in international operations. In this study, a mixed method was used, namely a quantitative approach through questionnaires and a qualitative approach through in-depth interviews. The research sample consisted of 52 respondents from multinational companies operating in the Southeast Asian region. The findings of the study show that there is a significant relationship between cultural adaptation and operational cost efficiency, with an important contribution from the strategic role of human resources as intermediaries. Companies that carry out cross-cultural training, adjust recruitment policies, and improve intercultural communication have been successful in reducing internal conflicts, increasing productivity, and lowering operational costs. Regression analysis revealed that the variables of cultural adaptation and the role of human resources together explained 64.5% of the variation in cost efficiency.

Discussions centered on how AVs may reshape land use patterns, influence real estate values, and disrupt existing transportation systems, while also offering opportunities to improve safety, accessibility, and sustainability. Panelists examined AV impacts across three domains\u2014design and land use, social and environmental equity, and economics and real estate\u2014and offered actionable policy recommendations for cities to prepare for an autonomous future. The report emphasizes the urgency for proactive planning, including revising zoning codes, rethinking parking infrastructure, investing in equitable access, and adapting revenue models to reflect AV-induced shifts.

Both adopting cloudbased ERP solutions and continuing to use On-Premise applications like QAD are important decisions as digital transformation increases. In this study, we conduct a retrospective case study of the costbenefit analysis of Implementing Cloud Vs On-Premise QAD from a mid-size manufacturing perspective. The analysis is conducted based on industry reports, vendor pricing models, and structured interviews with IT and finance professionals from 10 mid-sized manufacturing firms in various industries. Total cost of ownership (TCO), implementation timelines, scalability, integration capabilities, system reliability, and long-term Return On Investment (ROI) are evaluated. The results suggest that while On-Premise QAD provides more control and more customization, cloud ERP facilitates lower upfront capital expenditure, higher operational agility, and faster updates and integrations, at least for the cases covered. Cloud ERP solutions' TCO and ROI within the first five years are also lower than On-Premise solutions, especially those that are associated with rapid growth or having a lean IT shop. This suggests that cloud ERP is generally more cost-effective and more adaptable to those who are digitally mature, growing medium-sized manufacturers, and that On-Premise QAD may still suit companies with some unique regulatory or customization needs.

Depending on what will be defunded, the idea has attracted support from different parts of the political spectrum. The politicized nature of the debate often cuts short reflection on how best to assess proposals to defund the police. This article takes up that task. It begins by developing a typology of defund measures: abolitionist cuts, abolitionist reallocation, disaggregative cuts, and disaggregative reallocation. It then outlines a framework to evaluate policing and defund measures, drawing on criteria from the ethics of defensive force. Since policing relies on force, it faces a high justificatory bar and must satisfy the principles of just aim, proportionality, and necessity. The state should not fund unjustified forms of policing that violate those principles.

In particular, it investigates four different types of AI-based technologies and their impact on 9 typical purchasing processes. \u2022 Design/methodology/approach: Based on a survey of 50 purchasing professionals mostly at senior positions, we investigated four AI-based technologies and we test their respective impact on nine purchasing processes. We have completed this survey with a series of 8 interviews, to subject matter experts in the field of AI in purchasing, in order to increase the granularity of our findings. \u2022 Findings: We found out that the adoption of AI is perceived to have a strong impact only on specific activities of the purchasing process (spend analysis, data quality, contract management). Our findings highlighted also the weak perceived influence of AI-based technologies directly on cost savings and risks mitigation, if organization do not manage the implementation of these technologies properly. Finally, our respondents perceived that data quality is the main beneficiary of several AI technologies. These findings open large avenues for future research relatively to purchasing digital transformation and AI. \u2022 Originality: this paper is one of the first, not to say the first paper to investigate benefits of AI in purchasing, building on a deductive approach. \u2022 Research limitations/implications: This paper extends research on purchasing digital transformation by shifting from the focus on technology-centric outcomes, such as information system usage, to understanding the outcomes of AI on purchasing process. The main limitation comes from the limited dataset (N=50) but we overcame this constraint through the usage of interviews to increase findings granularity. \u2022 Practical implications: Our paper suggests that purchasing managers should not only consider AI-based technologies as an important technological artifact, but also view it as a key driver of functional and strategic efficiency. It highlights also the limitations of several AI-based technologies, in respect of specific purchasing processes."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5728\u91c7\u8d2d\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u56db\u79cdAI\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4e5d\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u91c7\u8d2d\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u652f\u51fa\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5408\u540c\u7ba1\u7406\uff09\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u91c7\u8d2d\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22AI\u5728\u91c7\u8d2d\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u7ece\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91c7\u8d2d\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5bf950\u540d\u91c7\u8d2d\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee58\u4f4dAI\u91c7\u8d2d\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "findings": "AI\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u91c7\u8d2d\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91c7\u8d2d\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ece\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f6c\u5411AI\u5bf9\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u8d2d\u7ecf\u7406\u5c06AI\u89c6\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u6218\u7565\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u610f\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Through a qualitative study of employees in an urban charter high school where race and class inequalities are salient, we find that socialization agents experience this tension as identity threatening. We develop a theoretical model of relational reconciliation that traces how agents engage with this identity threat in an ongoing, stumbling process. Through relational reconciliation, agents come to redefine their selves in relation to their \"socializees,\" which enables them to engage in elaborated socialization practices that aim to meet the needs of both the organization and the socializee. Our work repositions socialization agents as active parties in socialization, explores the tensions of socializing members of marginalized groups into a dominant culture, and reveals the importance of engaging with one's own identities to reconcile these tensions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5143\u4eba\u53e3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u6574\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u8c03\u548c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u591a\u5143\u4eba\u53e3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6574\u5408\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u5143\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u9636\u7ea7\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u663e\u8457\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f20\u529b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u5a01\u80c1\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u8c03\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u6240\u57ce\u5e02\u7279\u8bb8\u9ad8\u4e2d\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u8c03\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u6211\u4e0e\u201c\u88ab\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u8005\u201d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5f00\u5c55\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u8c03\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u5728\u8c03\u548c\u5f20\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5b9e\u8df5\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5e94\u5bf9\u8eab\u4efd\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

When a Moon ground station is transmitting to its target satellite, the transmission can be intercepted by another satellite in the vicinity. The risk of data interception should be limited for the goal of secure communications. A mixed integer linear program is formulated to maximize the reward from job data transmitted to Earth. The model is formulated to allow re-optimization at the next resolve period with remaining jobs in the system and the addition of new jobs. A heuristic using the linear program portion of the model and a job rank order allocation procedure is proposed. A schedule compression procedure is also proposed for the case without reward decay. Numerical experiments with and without reward decay are performed to evaluate the heuristic and to examine the impacts of increasing ground stations, satellites and satellite receive rate capacity."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u6708\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u4ece\u6708\u7403\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u5230\u5730\u7403\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u62e6\u622a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5730\u6708\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u8c03\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u62e6\u622a\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u5956\u52b1\uff1f", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u6708\u7403\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u5230\u5730\u7403\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u62e6\u622a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u91cd\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "findings": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u3001\u536b\u661f\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u901f\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u6708\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5730\u6708\u901a\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Legal Enforcement Index (LEI), a composite metric designed to assess the capacity and performance of justice delivery systems in India. Using data primarily from the India Justice Report (IJR) 2025, we construct the LEI based on six pillars: Police, Judiciary, Prisons, Legal Aid, Human Rights, and Anti-corruption. Our analysis reveals that Tamil Nadu's LEI for 2025 is 56.2, surpassing the estimated national average LEI of 52.4. The results indicate Tamil Nadu's relative strengths in prison management and judicial infrastructure, while also highlighting systemic national challenges such as workforce vacancies and prison overcrowding. The paper discusses the policy implications of these findings, addresses the methodological limitations stemming from data gaps in certain pillars, and proposes the use of regression analysis for future refinements of the index to ensure its empirical validity and robustness."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6267\u884c\u6307\u6570\uff08LEI\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5370\u5ea6\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u7eb3\u5fb7\u90a6\u7684LEI\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5168\u56fd\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u5370\u5ea6\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u662f\u6cd5\u6cbb\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u516d\u4e2a\u652f\u67f1\uff08\u8b66\u5bdf\u3001\u53f8\u6cd5\u3001\u76d1\u72f1\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63f4\u52a9\u3001\u4eba\u6743\u548c\u53cd\u8150\u8d25\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6267\u884c\u6307\u6570\uff08LEI\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5370\u5ea6\u53f8\u6cd5\u62a5\u544a\uff08IJR\uff092025\u5e74\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efaLEI\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u7eb3\u5fb7\u90a6\u7684LEI\u4e3a56.2\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5168\u56fd\u5e73\u574752.4\uff1b\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\u76d1\u72f1\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u53f8\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u56fd\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u5458\u7a7a\u7f3a\u548c\u76d1\u72f1\u62e5\u6324\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LEI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u6570\u3002"}}

However, the impact of demand uncertainty and financial risk on platform finance decisions remains underexplored. This study makes a key contribution by reframing demand uncertainty and risk as strategic levers rather than threats, providing a nuanced understanding of their dual roles in platform finance. By integrating operational and financial risk perspectives, this research fills a gap in the literature and offers a comprehensive framework for risk-informed financing decisions. This paper develops a game-theoretic model to analyze a platform offering two common financing schemes-credit financing and factoring finance-and a capital-constrained supplier, focusing on unveiling the hidden value of risk, namely, how different risk levels affect the platform's and supplier's operational and financial decisions. Our findings challenge the traditional view that operational and financial risks are purely negative and demonstrate these risks' hidden value. We find that platform finance not only alleviates liquidity constraints but also enhances profitability for both platforms and suppliers. Counterintuitively, low levels of both risks hinder Pareto improvements, while high operational risk can foster joint profit gains. Furthermore, increased demand uncertainty, often regarded as a threat, can improve profitability when financial risk is appropriately managed. Credit financing and factoring finance yield distinct profit outcomes depending on the platform's role as a reseller or marketplace and the financial risk level. Our findings provide actionable guidance for platforms and capital-constrained suppliers to optimize financing strategies, demonstrating that effectively leveraging demand uncertainty and risks can unlock profitability and drive sustainable competitive advantage in platform-based ecosystems."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u5e73\u53f0\u91d1\u878d\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u7528\u878d\u8d44\u548c\u4fdd\u7406\u878d\u8d44\u5e2e\u52a9\u8d44\u672c\u53d7\u9650\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u83b7\u53d6\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u975e\u7eaf\u7cb9\u8d1f\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5177\u6709\u6218\u7565\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "research_question": "\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5e73\u53f0\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u8ba8\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u5e73\u53f0\u91d1\u878d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u77e5\u60c5\u878d\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u878d\u8d44\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u4fe1\u7528\u878d\u8d44\u548c\u4fdd\u7406\u878d\u8d44\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u5e73\u53f0\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u6c34\u5e73\u53cd\u800c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u8fd0\u8425\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5171\u540c\u5229\u6da6\u589e\u957f\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u878d\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5176\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}
