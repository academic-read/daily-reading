Consistent with the demographic dividend hypothesis, it coincided with a fertility decline, but thrift rose across different age groups undermining the theory's plausibility. This suggests that shocks prompted parents to prioritize physical capital over children as sources of post-retirement income, which included family planning initiatives, public investment in education, and financial deregulation. Both econometric and simulation evidence shows that financial liberalization mattered far more than other interventions in Korea's transition from labor-to capital-abundance. The South Korean government lifted financial repression because diverting returns to investment from savers to favored firms was politically unsustainable."}}

Employing a mixed-methods approach, it combines quantitative analysis of panel data from 60 developing countries over three decades with qualitative case studies from diverse regions.

The findings reveal that low parental education, unstable income, single-parent households, and restrictive cultural or religious beliefs significantly impede girls' access to and continuity in formal education.

Using an extended gravity model with bilateral FDI data from 2010 to 2023, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of geopolitical distance across regions, including the United States, European Union, China, Latin America, and intra-ASEAN partners. Our results reveal contrasting dynamics: while FDI from the EU is positively associated with political alignment, U.S. and Chinese FDI increases with geopolitical distance, suggesting diverse geoeconomic strategies. These findings underscore ASEAN's strategic position as a resilient investment hub and offer new insights into the political economy of FDI in an era of global uncertainty."}}

Drawing on a range of primary and secondary sources, including policy documents, and international trade data, the study delves into the ramifications of Brexit on the UK's trade dynamics and the nation's position in the global market. A prominent shift in the UK's post-Brexit trade policy is the pursuit of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements independent of the EU framework. While the UK has managed to secure deals with countries like Japan and Australia, as well as trade blocs like ASEAN and CPTPP, impact scale of these agreements are under scrutiny.

It is a form of social media marketing in which brands partner with content creators to promote their products. The rise of digital technology has profoundly changed the marketing landscape, where traditional strategies are giving way to new models that focus on authentic and personalised interactions. Influencer Marketing has emerged as a powerful tool that allows brands to connect directly with consumers. However, a significant shift from version 1.0, which relied on celebrities, to version 2.0, which emphasises the role of nano-influencers, is reshaping the approach to the market. As evidence of their dominance, industry data shows that nano-influencers now account for 87% of all influencers on TikTok and 76% on Instagram, with the highest engagement rates of any group. This article systematically analyses nano-influencers' role, arguing that their effectiveness stems from their ability to build social connections based on deep trust, reinforced by authenticity and intimacy. Through a synthesis of academic literature and industry data, the article will clarify the advantages, challenges, and prospects of this trend."}}

This study is motivated by the increasing practice of Islamic branding in the service industry, which assumes that Islamic symbols can shape Muslim consumer loyalty. However, various empirical findings show inconsistent results regarding the effectiveness of this approach on repurchase intention. On the other hand, studies on the role of customer experience in shaping Muslim consumer loyalty are still limited, especially in the context of beauty services that rely heavily on perception and experience. This study uses a quantitative explanatory approach through a survey of 165 respondents who are customers of the beauty service \"Hayyu Skin Clinic\" in Malang City, East Java, Indonesia. The analysis uses the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. The results show that customer experience significantly affects repurchase intention and brand trust. Conversely, Islamic branding does not directly influence repurchase intention or brand trust. Furthermore, brand trust cannot significantly mediate the effect of Islamic branding on repurchase intention. These findings underscore the importance of real-life experience-based marketing strategies over religious identity symbols and provide insight into Muslim consumers' increasingly rational and pragmatic behaviour."}}

Before making choice, the student can learn the underlying persistent state through experimentation, but bears the incurred costs alone. The educator, being privately informed of the experiment outcomes, provides evaluation to the student over time. We show that the educator should almost exclusively rely on encouragement. The optimal policy can be implemented through truthfully disclosing with delay, which starts at zero, then increases strictly and finally vanishes."}}

These obstacles arise from inflexible learning modalities, elevated linguistic requirements, rigid evaluation frameworks, and insufficient individualized assistance, resulting in the exclusion of talent and less diversity within the field. This research study advocates for the intentional design and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven technologies as a fundamental element of inclusive certification paths in finance education. We integrate literature from educational psychology, neurodiversity research, language acquisition, and artificial intelligence in education to identify the distinct obstacles encountered by various student populations. We subsequently introduce an extensive framework for the design of AI tools, emphasizing adaptive learning, multimodal content delivery, intelligent scaffolding, linguistic assistance, personalized evaluation, and predictive analytics. A comprehensive case study demonstrates the implementation of this approach in relation to a particular finance certification. The study finishes by addressing practical obstacles, ethical considerations, future research avenues, and the revolutionary potential of AI in democratizing access to financial credentials, hence promoting a more varied and inventive business."}}

Based on a hermeneutic review of 48 peer-reviewed studies (2019–2025) and 7 recent policy reports, we trace the evolution from data-driven insight to data-driven control. While algorithmic systems offer efficiency and scalability, they also introduce opacity, lack of transparency, and psychological strain—particularly when decision-making is fully delegated to machines. Anchored in Self-Determination Theory and Labour Process Theory, we propose a novel three-stage DDD framework—Datafication, Delegation, and Displacement—to assess the intensity of algorithmic control in organisational settings. We offer a conceptual model to help HR scholars and practitioners diagnose risks of algorithmic governance and develop ethical countermeasures. We conclude with an agenda for Responsible Algorithmic HRM and outline actionable research pathways—including design-based, comparative, and qualitative studies—for future PhD-level research and ethical HR system design."}}

Instead, this paper proposes the \"Quiet Singularity\" theoretical framework, which redefines the singularity as a decentralized, gradual, and individualized process of cognitive and capability enhancement, unfolding through deep human-AI symbiosis. The primary expression of this personalized transcendence is the \"Super Individual\": an agent empowered by digital technology to achieve levels of influence historically accessible only to large organizations. The research critically examines how the \"Super Individual\" phenomenon can be operationalized and investigates its cross-cultural variations and societal consequences. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study integrates theoretical construction, historical prototype analysis, and quantitative cross-cultural comparison. The Super Individual Conceptual Framework (SICF) is defined through four dimensions-Digital Autonomy, Networked Influence, Personal Branding, and Cross-boundary Integration-and validated via statistical examination of representative cases. Findings indicate that \"Super Individual\" capabilities differ significantly between individualistic and collectivistic cultural backgrounds, suggesting that the Quiet Singularity is not a singular global event but may catalyze distinct evolutionary pathways with unique civilizational characteristics. The study's contribution lies in offering a human-centered model to understand technological transcendence, and in proposing a \"pluriverse\" vision of diverse posthuman futures, challenging deterministic accounts of a single human destiny."}}

While OFD services have rapidly expanded, issues such as inconsistent service quality, food safety concerns, and delivery inefficiencies persist, limiting overall consumer satisfaction. Existing research has often focused on global or highly urbanized regions, creating a gap in understanding consumer behavior in regional cities. This study investigates the influence of product and service quality on customer satisfaction and loyalty among OFD users in Davao City, with a focus on the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector-a key demographic due to its fast-paced work environment and reliance on delivery services. Adopting a descriptive-correlational research design, data were gathered from 111 respondents through survey questionnaires. Quantitative analysis, including correlation and regression techniques, was applied to determine the relationships among quality indicators and satisfaction outcomes. Findings indicate that while the quality of services significantly influences customer satisfaction, product quality alone does not strongly predict satisfaction levels. This suggests that consumers place greater value on responsive and reliable service over product attributes alone. The study underscores the importance of enhancing service efficiency, usability, and trust to improve customer experience and loyalty.

This paper leverages a quasi-natural experiment, the 2020 announcement of China’s dual carbon goals, to investigate how consumers shift their purchasing behavior away from high-carbon food products and how a large supermarket chain responds via pricing and assortment. Using transaction data and a difference-in-differences design, we find a 5.7% decline in sales of carbon-intensive items. Heterogeneity across store regions suggests the influence of income, institutional proximity, and environmental salience. In response to weakened demand, the retailer implements price markdowns and increased promotional frequency to reduce inventory of high-carbon products. Over time, these products are less likely to be restocked, reflecting a shift in procurement and assortment. Complementing these findings, we observe a decline in the entry of new firms producing high-carbon foods, providing further evidence of diminished profitability in the wake of the policy initiative. This study contributes to the literature on responsible retail operations by demonstrating that demand-side sustainability transitions, triggered by public policies, have tangible operational implications. Retailers not only respond to evolving consumer preferences but also translate public sustainability mandates into concrete operational actions."}}

Using a constructivist grounded theory method, it analyses 500 Facebook and YouTube adverts published between July 2020 and July 2025 to develop a practical typology of intertextual references. Three categories emerge: Direct References (12.2%), Indirect References (56.0%), and Non-Referential Adverts (31.8%). Direct references feature clearly recognisable borrowings such as parodies, brand collaborations, or confrontations. Indirect references draw on cultural cues, timing, and user-driven trends. Non-referential adverts rely solely on core brand messaging. The findings show a strong preference for indirect, culturally embedded communication. The typology offers Malawian marketers a tool to align advertising strategies with local meaning systems and holds potential for use across sub-Saharan African markets with similar digital and cultural environments."}}

Edge computing can enhance security and privacy which has been said to raise the current state of the art in these areas. For example, when certain processing of data can be done local to where requested, security and privacy can be enhanced. However, Edge AI in such an environment can be prone to its own security and privacy considerations, especially in the digital marketing context where personal data is involved. An ongoing challenge is maintaining security in such context and meeting various legal privacy requirements as they themselves continue to evolve, and many of which are not entirely clear from the technical perspective.

The penalty initially arises from reductions in time-based pay after childbirth. Over time, job-rank-based pay becomes increasingly significant, becoming the dominant factor by the 15-year mark. These effects are interconnected: reduced working hours lead to lower performance evaluations, which subsequently limit promotion opportunities. Our model demonstrates that current promotion practices, which reward extended hours at entrylevel positions, can generate production inefficiency. This finding suggests that addressing promotion practices could simultaneously reduce gender inequality and improve talent allocation, making a business case for organizational reform."}}

Recent studies demonstrate that properly incentivized respondents make qualitatively different choices. However, through the lens of random utility models, incentives seem to reduce consistency, reflected in a lower scale of preference estimates, which is widely considered as a measure of choice quality-a result that concerns researchers who consider incentive-alignment and contradicts the large literature that suggests incentives increase decision effort and performance. This paper proposes a model, based on a stochastic process reflecting cognitive processing of attributes and alternatives, to shed light on the mechanism underlying the differences between hypothetical (HYP) and incentivized (ICA) multi-attribute choice. Importantly, the model yields measures of realized cognitive effort that we find to increase in ICA settings, while underlying preferences remain stable. ICA respondents attend to more attributes, resolve more tradeoffs, and in turn process more information when making inside choices. Consequently, ICA choices are indeed less consistent than HYP choices but more aligned with respondents' preferences, and hence of higher quality. We discuss how these results improve DCE design choices and inference from data collected at different incentive levels."}}

One way healthcare providers can communicate reassurance is by informing patients when their symptoms are normal, either for a particular life stage (e.g., menopause) or for a particular health context (e.g., post-procedural pain). Normalizing a patient's symptoms can have positive effects, including lowering their anxiety and improving their health outlook, but as we demonstrate, paradoxically, may reduce interest in getting treatment. Across six online experiments, we show that healthcare providers often normalize patients' symptoms as a form of affective reassurance, and that this well-intentioned approach can unintentionally reduce patients' inclination to pursue treatment. By labeling symptoms normal, healthcare providers inadvertently send patients signals about treatment norms. Patients infer that the healthcare provider does not perceive their symptoms are severe enough to warrant treatment, which can leave patients feeling dismissed and foster negative impressions of the provider. Moreover, the decision to forego treatment can ultimately lead to meaningful reductions in quality of life. Yet, our data shows that healthcare providers who use normalizing language rarely intend to discourage treatment. This critical disconnect highlights the importance of effective provider-patient communications and how subtle linguistic cues can have a substantial impact."}}

While AI technologies such as machine learning, chatbots, and predictive analytics are transforming global marketing practices, adoption within Nigeria remains limited and uneven. Using a mixed-methods approach, this study combines survey data from 210 SMEs and in-depth interviews with 15 digital marketing professionals across Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. It also draws on established adoption frameworks and existing literature to assess AI readiness across five key areas: infrastructure, organizational capability, strategic alignment, workforce competence, and regulatory environment. Findings reveal a moderate level of awareness and interest in AI, but actual implementation is hampered by poor internet connectivity, limited technical expertise, lack of localized tools, and insufficient investment. Despite these constraints, many enterprises express optimism about AI's potential to enhance marketing efficiency and customer engagement. However, most lack structured roadmaps for adoption and face significant challenges in integrating AI into existing systems. The paper identifies core barriers and enabling factors, and proposes a strategic roadmap for scalable AI adoption. Recommendations include targeted digital skills development, improved access to cloud infrastructure, supportive policy frameworks, and local innovation support. The study contributes to understanding how emerging economies like Nigeria can harness AI for digital transformation and offers actionable insights for policymakers, business leaders, and digital marketing practitioners aiming to close the AI adoption gap in Africa's largest economy."}}

This research paper looks at how these factors influence brand trust among various segments of the Indian consumer market, including rural, urban, and Non-Resident Indian (NRI) populations. The study takes a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data from surveys with qualitative insights from real-world case studies. One notable example is the strategic rise of Jio in the Indian telecom industry. Jio illustrates how a solid reputation and diverse market presence can boost brand acceptance and trust, even in a competitive environment. Our main research question asks whether Indian consumers trust local, national, or foreign brands more. It also explores the psychological, emotional, and cultural reasons behind these preferences. Key variables examined include consumer loyalty, perceived brand credibility, and the impact of familiarity and personal values on buying choices. The research provides valuable insights for businesses looking to build trust in different socioeconomic groups and regions. It highlights how cultural context, previous brand exposure, and emotional ties influence consumer decisions in emerging markets like India. These findings are particularly useful for marketers, brand strategists, and startups aiming to create trust-focused marketing models in India's diverse economic landscape."}}

Walt's balance of threat theory to account for the rise of hybrid risks and systemic vulnerabilities. Traditional realist paradigms, which emphasize deterrence against proximate and militarized threats, are increasingly inadequate in a strategic environment shaped by cyber insecurity, climate disruption, economic fragility, and cognitive warfare. The paper introduces the concept of vulnerability buffering, wherein states align not to counter aggression but to co-manage shared exposure to transnational, non-attributable risks. Through a proposed hybrid-power framework, the analysis integrates conventional military capabilities with non-traditional assets such as digital infrastructure, energy resilience, and information control. Drawing on case studies-including EU-Indo Pacific tech pacts, Middle East digital security cooperation, and the Quad and AUKUS frameworks-the paper illustrates how modern alliances are modular, adaptive, and domain-diverse. It also identifies the emergence of crisisconvergence alliances, flexible coalitions formed in response to systemic shocks, which reflect a shift from deterrence to resilience as the primary logic of cooperation. The findings challenge classical realist assumptions and call for renewed scholarship that bridges international relations theory with complexity science and network governance. The paper concludes by advocating for forward-looking policy that embraces proactive alliance formation, inclusive governance models, and resilience-oriented design to ensure systemic stability in an increasingly fragmented world."}}

There's no doubt that the economic exiles have so much potential in contributing to the relationship between politics and development of the economy in host countries. The evolution of identity politics hiding behind tribalism, is challenged by the economic exiles to create the appetite for effective competition yet some countries such as South Africa, are getting rid of the economic exiles. The young people are divided over the issue because of lack of knowledge on the existence of their parents, now holding citizenship. Some view economic exiles as vital in shaping the people's mind-sets, others see them as the threat to the country's development. The threat of economic exiles has been uttered by the politicians who do not understand the changing trends taking place in the world, most Southern African governments have run out of ideas to develop their communities. The economic exiles both legal and illegal are used as a scapegoat by the incompetent public officials to either exploit or loot the taxpayer's money. This has led to an increase in nepotism, tribalism and eventually racism, which have shaped economic developments to contextualise effective governance. This has been carving a route through a wide range of existing 10 articles, 2 selected to identify literatures relevant to managing the economy of Southern African states, despite the presence of economic exiles. The different literatures identify key gaps in Southern African politics and indicate the widening gap of brotherhood, which is likely to have resentment in future, knowingly Africa is side-lined. The findings for this paper are diverse governance structures, arbitrary borders, the struggle for independence and ineffective regional integration. As a result, the findings are closely linked the identification recommendations, which provide guides to change African states systems of governing."}}

Research on BRICS functions in developed and developing countries given much attention to restructure and develop their economies. However, few research studies have been conducted in assessing the importance and implementation of BRICS to fight the economic dominance of the United States. Research purpose: The objective of this study was to examine BRICS integrity in practice and its perceived importance in fighting economic dominance as well as the limitations or barriers to effective development. The motivation for the study: BRICS play a strategic role in different African and Asian countries indicating the relatively little issue known about the United States economy dominance. This research aimed to contribute to the knowledge of BRICS to enhance the understanding and importance of fighting economic dominance. Research approach/design and method: A qualitative research design was followed, sampling the articles used to collect the data from the different scholars published by different institutions. Main findings: BRICS vulnerable to price fluctuations in global markets, lacks a formal institutional structure, tensions hinder collaboration and weaken the group's effectiveness in addressing common goals, economic inequalities and social issues within member countries lead to domestic unrest and challenges to political stability acknowledged as crucial. The study further found that a limited budget, lack of resources and capacity, inadequate systems, ineffective employment relationships, lack of knowledge and understanding of BRICS negatively affect the implementation of policies and therefore negatively influence the United States economy. Practical/managerial implications: All BRICS member states are aware of the United States threat of causing dysfunctions that could undermine its success as an organisation. Contribution/value-add: The study findings will assist both the developed and developing nations to implement and understand the importance of BRICS in advocating equality as well as lifting the barriers to economic development."}}

The influence of these institutions on Africa's governance has often been overlooked, partly due to scrutiny from oversight bodies like parliaments. The article connects policy implementation challenges and the consequences of mismanagement of IMF and World Bank interventions, emphasizing the need for policy adjustments across different institutions. Employing a systematic qualitative literature review, the study analyzes the effects of the IMF and World Bank on governance in Africa by examining eight articles, both contemporary and historical. This review sheds light on the longstanding exploitative theories that have undermined Africa, despite its wealth of resources. It reveals how policies imposed by the IMF and World Bank are often executed at the expense of Africans striving to escape poverty. The literature contextualizes these effects, illustrating how the IMF and World Bank's involvement can hinder public institutions from achieving efficiency and effectiveness. While the primary focus is on the implications for public officials, the article identifies knowledge gaps that connect to necessary policy adjustments. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to enhance understanding of the IMF and World Bank's influence on governance in Africa and to encourage self-sufficiency in managing the evolving challenges."}}

However, few research studies have been conducted in assessing the importance and implementation of economic collaboration in Africa. Research purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the implementation of the influence of power on the depth of economic collaboration in Africa, as well as the limitations or barriers to effective development. The motivation for the study: The influence of power on the depth of economic collaboration in Africa play a strategic role in any state and different organisations. Literature studies indicate that relatively little is known about economic collaboration in maintaining the development of economics in Africa. This research aimed to contribute to the knowledge of the depth of economic collaboration to enhance the understanding and importance of the African states in global economy. Research approach/design and method: A qualitative research design was followed, 8 articles were samples, where the data was collected to understand the meaning of economic collaboration. This sampling technique was used to collect data from the previous literature published by different organisations. Main findings: The influences of power on the depth of economic collaboration in Africa were informally implemented and acknowledged by the International community. The study further found that insecurity causing displacement, the increase in political instability and conflicts, the weak institutional frameworks, the trade barriers and bureaucracy, and difficult to overcome in strained diplomatic ties affected by the sanctions. Practical/managerial implications: All African states are aware of the influence of power on the depth of economic collaboration that enhance both economic and political stability. Contribution/value-add: The study findings might assist African states towards economic collaboration as well as overcoming the barriers to effective implementation of economic policies."}}

This paper reframes it as a cognitive adaptation to complexity. Tracing a sequence of systemic perturbations-from the Rio Earth Summit to the Global Financial Crisis, from COVID-19 to IFRS S1/S2-we examine how sustainability moved from moral principle to institutional architecture. Drawing on the Four Worlds framework and anchored in complexity science, the paper argues that sustainability did not evolve in a straight line. It emerged, again and again, through failure: when systems misread their own fragility. As codification deepens, a paradox emerges. The crisis-born urgency that animated sustainability may be displaced by procedural regularity. The risk is not regulatory failure, but epistemic forgetting. Sustainability must now be treated not as a fixed goal, but as a form of distributed intelligence-a logic of navigation under uncertainty, where coherence, anticipation, and limits define viable futures. I. Defining Sustainability Sustainability is often invoked in policy and public discourse as a moral imperative or political stance. But such framings, while not incorrect, are insufficient. At root, sustainability is a systems condition. It is not about preserving the status quo or restraining consumption per se. It is about ensuring that the trajectories of our ecological, economic, and institutional systems remain within bounded, intelligible domains-capable of adaptation without collapse. In this deeper sense, sustainability can be understood as the avoidance of singularity."}}

These were the people with proper names who held institutions together-not grand, not infallible, but human, local, embodied. Now, in the age of algorithmic everything, those people are gone. We have platforms, dashboards, personalized interfaces. We have AI diagnostics, robo-advisors, and autograded essays. We have convenience; what we no longer have are the people who saw us in context. This is the quiet force of digital disintermediation. Celebrated as a triumph of efficiency and empowerment, it is also a widespread unpeopling of service. And in that unpeopling, we lose more than we gain. We lose institutional memory, professional discretion, and the subtle relational cues that make a system feel not only functional but meaningful. Take education, for example. The promise of EdTech lies in modular, scalable, self-paced acquisition. The reality is an attenuated learning relationship. AI can tailor content, but it cannot mentor. It cannot recognize when a student looks defeated, bored, or frightened. The disintermediated classroom is not merely instructor-less; it is increasingly devoid of counseling, trust, and context. Healthcare is no different. AI can parse symptoms, but it cannot weigh the history behind the hesitancy. It cannot sense that what a patient fears most is not illness but dismissal. A good doctor sees more than data; she sees the person behind the pattern. Strip away the clinician, and you also strip away centuries of embodied knowledge, patient advocacy, and ethical improvisation. Even in retail and finance, we are told the algorithm is friendlier, faster, frictionless. But friction was also feedback. The puzzled pause of a teller, the second look from a shop clerk, the cautionary tone of an advisor-these were not inefficiencies. They were signals. They were care. And care is the word we must not forget."}}

The successive elections scheduled were conducted to oversee the rule over the country considerably with more political stability than creating a culture of political fear, which may dismantle the breakdown of morality in communities. The African National Congress (ANC) comfortable majority win has been affected by conflict of interests amounting to corrupt activities, which is a threat to govern South Africa for the foreseeable future. The aim of this article is to examine the hopes and fears of South Africans to govern their institutions and assess the potential breakdown of morality. The huge economic meltdown affecting South Africa continue to engulf social lives dividing the people of South Africa, this time among the Black people. The majority of Black people are faced with the economic misery increasing due to changes in the country. The economy of South Africa continues to decline due to the loss of traditional mining base to other Southern African countries which have untapped minerals. From every other point of view, however, the prospects of the ANC regaining its support to secure the electorate base looks bleak. A wave 2 of migrants from neighbouring countries creates fears among the South Africans who regard them as troublesome and planning a hostile takeover of the country in future. The increase of violent crimes claims tens of thousands of victims, are closely linked to politics of domination. As a result, the fears are closely linked to rivalries among political parties, which are the breeding grounds for both the political and criminal 'warlords' infiltrating the South African government institutions."}}

This gap creates a governance blind spot, enabling opaque algorithmic control to expand without democratic oversight. \n<br>\n This paper introduces a symbolic governance model that maps the flow of influence from capital owners and political authorities through technological infrastructures and algorithmic design, down to societal targets and cultural feedback loops. By translating technical complexity into an accessible analytical language, the framework equips non-technical stakeholders—diplomats, journalists, and policy analysts—with tools to decode embedded power structures in AI ecosystems. In doing so, it reframes AI not as a neutral tool but as an encoded structure of influence, shaped by human actors in a continuous interplay between economics, politics, technology, and society."}}

This study develops a game-theoretical framework to investigate how the strategic interactions among shipping companies and the port under the four channel structures, i.e., Single-Leader Multi-Follower competitive (SLMF-Com), Single-Leader Multi-Follower cooperative (SLMF-Coo), Cooperative Multi-Leader Single-Follower (Coo-MLSF), and Co-opetition, affect the decisions on shore power adoption and pricing under the governmental carbon tax and subsidy policies. Theoretical results reveal that the joint implementation of carbon taxes and per-unit subsidies substantially broadens the equilibrium conditions for shore power adoption, proving more effective than either policy separately. Changes in bargaining power structures, such as port dominance or stronger shipping alliances, play a significant role in shaping adoption incentives and distributing revenue and profits. While port-led scenarios maximize port revenue, shipping company alliances can secure higher profits. The game-theoretical analysis also identifies a pervasive \"prisoner's dilemma\" where excessive competition, even with low retrofit costs, can suppress overall adoption rates, highlighting the need for coordinated policies. Furthermore, adopting shore power consistently increases cargo volumes, indicating its potential as a market-expanding strategy. The numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses, conducted based on the real-world data from the Shanghai Port, empirically validate these theoretical findings. The numerical results demonstrate that higher carbon taxes and targeted subsidies effectively improve shipping companies' willingness to adopt shore power and improve green performance for ports, confirm that per-unit subsidies are more effective than one-off capital subsidies for sustained adoption, and highlight how practical barriers like connection delays and infrastructure heterogeneity impede uptake. This study concludes that multi-party collaboration and integrated incentive mechanisms are vital for improving policy effectiveness and accelerating maritime decarbonization, providing robust theoretical evidence and actionable policy guidance for green port development and the low-carbon transformation of the shipping industry."}}

Cotton is a critical input for textile-related industrial activity and serves as a major source of direct and indirect employment across rural regions, particularly in the indigenous handloom sector, forming a key component of spatially distributed employment systems. This paper discusses the significance of the handloom sector within the framework of regional economic development and spatial planning in India, examining how geographic disparities and planning failures affect rural livelihoods and traditional crafts. It positions the handloom sector as the earliest and enduring embodiment of Atmanirbhar Bharat, especially in the context of decentralized economic development and local self-reliance. It highlights the sector's historical antiquity, its pre-colonial prominence, colonial decline, and the contemporary socioeconomic vulnerabilities faced by handloom artisans in underserved regions. This study traces the sector's spatial evolution from historical prominence through colonial disruption to its present-day fragility, highlighting how planning failures and geographic disparities have undermined sustainable livelihood systems. The paper reviews past and present policy measures aimed at revitalising the sector, protecting weavers' livelihoods, and addressing regional disparities that threaten inclusive and sustainable development. It further explores the structural resilience and competitive differentiators of the handloom sector, emphasizing the need to protect this cultural economy not only for its economic and employment potential but also as a vehicle for spatial equity, knowledge preservation, and social justice."}}

In contrast, the PR system offers a more inclusive framework that ensures fair representation of diverse political and social groups. Drawing on comparative global case studies and democratic theory, this proposal evaluates the potential of PR to strengthen political accountability, reduce electoral violence, and enhance public trust in democratic institutions. It further examines the structural and legal adjustments required for a successful transition to a PR system.

This research explores how adaptive leadership enables organizations to not only respond effectively to crisis conditions but also to build long-term resilience and pursue growth. Drawing on a qualitative, multiple-case study design, the study investigates mid-to-large-sized organizations from the healthcare, education, and technology sectors in the MENA region that experienced significant crises within the last five years. Through in-depth semi-structured interviews and document analysis, the study identifies key adaptive leadership behaviors such as distributed decision-making, transparent communication, psychological safety, and rapid learning. The findings reveal that adaptive leadership is a dynamic, context-sensitive process that fosters not only organizational stability but also strategic renewal. Importantly, the study demonstrates that adaptive leadership enables the reconfiguration of business models, acceleration of digital transformation, and enhancement of stakeholder trust critical levers for post-crisis growth. This thesis contributes to the evolving field of leadership and crisis management by offering a contextualized, practice-oriented adaptive leadership framework. It emphasizes the need for culturally sensitive, sector-specific strategies and proposes practical tools for organizations seeking to enhance their adaptive capacity. The insights derived from this research are relevant for organizational leaders, policymakers, and scholars interested in navigating complexity and disruption with resilience and foresight."}}

This study examines the potential role of compulsory military training in enhancing national resilience, civic responsibility, and strategic readiness. Through a qualitative approach supported by a review of policy documents, and comparative international case studies, the paper evaluates how a structured, nationwide training program could contribute to civil defense capabilities and foster a culture of national discipline and unity. The research also considers possible socio-political, economic, and ethical implications, including its impact on youth, educational institutions, and civil-military relations.

Financial training providers, who have historically relied on legacy models (classroom-centric, static content, standardized delivery), are now faced with an existential imperative: either digitally transition or risk obsolescence. This exhaustive research paper examines the multifaceted journey of digital transformation (DX) for financial training providers, with a particular emphasis on the catalytic role of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We examine the critical variables that require DX, such as the skills gap explosion, learner expectations, cost pressures, and competitive threats from EdTech natives. In this paper, the fundamental components of DX are examined: data-driven insights, personalized learning pathways, immersive technologies (VR/AR), cloud-native infrastructure, and content digitization and modularization. It is imperative that we investigate the manner in which AI functions as the central nervous system of this transformation, facilitating hyper-personalization, intelligent content generation, adaptive assessment, predictive analytics, and conversational learning support. We present actionable implementation roadmaps through strategic frameworks and case studies, with a focus on the evolving role of human expertise, ethical considerations (transparency, bias), and change management. The research finds that AI-powered DX is not merely an upgrade, but a fundamental reboot. This upgrade enables training providers to deliver superior learning outcomes, achieve operational efficiency, enhance scalability, and secure a sustainable competitive advantage in the dynamic landscape of financial education. Legacy providers may be rendered obsolete if they fail to implement this transformation."}}

This research paper examines the rapid growth and geographic spread of the TPLF industry over the past few decades, providing a comparative analysis of key jurisdictions and an in-depth look at the nascent yet promising Indian market. We trace the origins of TPLF in countries like Australia and the United Kingdom, its expansion into the United States and other regions, and the current market size and trends that underscore its mainstream acceptance. The paper discusses drivers behind TPLF's rise, from access to justice and risk management benefits for claimants, to attractive returns for investors as well as the challenges and controversies it has engendered, including regulatory and ethical questions surrounding disclosure, profit-sharing, and control of litigation. Drawing on industry reports, investor surveys, and case law, we highlight how different legal systems have responded to TPLF: some embracing it with regulatory frameworks or self-regulation, others grappling with concerns about maintenance and champerty or calls for stricter oversight. In particular, we focus on India's unique position: despite lacking a formal regulatory regime, Indian courts have signaled that TPLF is permissible for non-lawyers, and a handful of domestic startups and investors have begun testing the waters. We analyze the opportunities that TPLF presents in India such as financing meritorious claims in an overburdened judicial system and the obstacles to its growth, including legal ambiguities, ethical constraints on lawyers, and the need for investor confidence. The paper identifies research gaps in understanding TPLF's long-term impact on legal systems and calls for balanced regulatory measures. We conclude that third-party litigation funding, if responsibly integrated, is poised to play a vital role in the future of legal services and access to justice globally, and could become a transformative force in India's dispute resolution landscape."}}

This study investigates a two-sided subsidy framework agreement for a bilateral supply chain to enhance readiness against demand and production uncertainties, comparing it with stockpiling and forward agreements as benchmarks. Using a modified newsvendor model in a game-theoretic setting, we demonstrate that integrating subsidy and default penalty incentivizes the supplier to maintain higher inventory levels, reducing supply disruption risks while causing overstocking. Our analysis shows that the speculative supplier rationally stocks less than the buyer's ordering quantity in a fixed amount. The framework agreement provides a financially viable, win–win solution for managing emergency risks—especially in low‐probability events, where existing benchmarks falter. Furthermore, we examine scenarios with conflicting interests to see how the allocation of decision rights affects which agreement can be executed, showing that the framework agreement emerges as the final resolution in most cases and outperforms the commonly adopted stockpiling agreement. Finally, we present a real‐world case study to numerically demonstrate how strategic subsidies can overcome traditional trade-offs between inventory availability and financial costs, offering policymakers and practitioners an effective tool to improve emergency preparedness."}}

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, which enables electric vehicles (EVs) to both draw power from and supply power back to the grid, presents a particularly important opportunity to contribute to this goal. However, this technology faces legal and regulatory barriers in some EU Member States, including Spain. This article investigates the contribution of V2G technology to sector coupling and examines its potential participation in balancing markets, with a specific focus on the Spanish context. Balancing markets are technically well-suited for V2G participation, but Spain's current legislation presents significant barriers. While EU level regulations supporting the integration of V2G technology were introduced under the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package, Spain's delayed or incomplete transposition of these rules into national law continues to prevent V2G from entering the Spanish electricity balancing markets. The article analyzes the key legal and regulatory factors behind this limitation, particularly the market design favoring large-scale centralized production and the absence of a legal framework for independent aggregators. Nevertheless, it concludes that recent and ongoing legislative developments in Spain offer promising signs that these obstacles may be removed in the near future. This analysis is limited to legal and regulatory aspects and does not address technical, economic, or social dimensions of V2G deployment, which are also critical to achieving full integration."}}

The 20<sup>th</sup> century was like a pendulum, swinging between narratives that we must abolish private ownership in the means of production, to saying there ‘are virtually no limits on what can be privatized’, and hovering as if ready to swing again. By contrast, this paper shows that outcomes improve and costs decrease when enterprises are publicly owned, if property is ‘non-accessible’. Otherwise private ownership is better. Property is ‘non-accessible’ if an enterprise is a skill-based, natural, or network monopoly. Property is ‘accessible’ if people can buy land or capital, source materials or vehicles, or get skills or knowledge to start up a business. Then, competition channels private greed into the public good. This paper contends that data lets us move beyond ideological clash, and gives answers that practically assist policy, to fill the gaps in human rights and market failure frameworks. For example, water is 90% publicly owned in wealthy countries, with lower bills and better outcomes. For rail, fares are lower with greater electrification if tracks and operators are public. For electricity, bills are lower with more renewables if grids and a retail option are public. For telecom networks, public ownership tends to reduce bills and raise internet speed. Most wealthy countries hold non-accessible property in public hands, and do better for it. </span></p>\n<div>\n <span><br></span>\n</div>\n<div>\n <span>Three further principles are crucial if circumstances change. First, technology can change what is accessible property, such as renewables making electricity generation competitive, or big tech data creating new monopolies. So, law must respond to tech. Second, there may be good non-economic reasons, such as protecting democracy and the environment, to change the public/private balance. Third, good governance is distinct from wise ownership choices, and generally supports voice for workers, as well as investors, and service-users where competition fails. Together, good governance and wise ownership socialise the nature of all property, and internally transform the public-private divide. Policymakers should base decisions on the evidence of what works, and this theory helps make those decisions. </span>\n</div>"}}

However, conventional diesel tugboats generate substantial emissions during operations, prompting seaport operators to adopt electric alternatives. This paper studies the electric tugboat scheduling problem to simultaneously optimize the working and charging schedules of electric tugboats. The complexity of this problem arises from (i) time consistency constraints that require multiple electric tugboats to work simultaneously, (ii) service sequence constraints that establish precedence relationships between different tugging services, and (iii) nonlinear charging profiles of electric tugboats. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model. A tailored branch-and-price (BP) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. To handle the time consistency constraints and service sequence constraints that incur interdependence among schedules in the BP framework, two types of customized feasibility branching strategies are introduced. Additionally, the BP algorithm is further enhanced through an improved restricted master problem that provides tighter lower bounds and a customized bi-directional labeling algorithm that solves pricing subproblems. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution method are evaluated using numerical experiments based on operational data from a container terminal in Shanghai. The computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm."}}

The retailer commits to purchasing a certain amount of electricity in the day-ahead market, one day before the actual demand of its customers is realized, and thus faces imbalance risks due to demand uncertainty. These imbalances are penalized by a regulatory mechanism involving penalty parameters set by the energy market authority. We examine how effectively these parameters influence the retailer's strategic commitment behavior and contribute to reducing overall system imbalances. By developing a variant of the newsvendor model, we show that the penalty parameters significantly shape the retailer's tendency to undercommit or overcommit. Their effects vary depending on the total amount committed by other retailers in the market and the price dynamics in both the day-ahead and balancing markets. Using real hourly demand data from Türkiye, we empirically demonstrate that the effect of these penalty parameters on the deviations between the expected and optimal commitment amounts could differ hourly, daily, seasonally, regionally, and according to sectoral demand profiles."}}

Conversely, lower mean scores were observed in areas such as providing timely feedback to stakeholders, participating in community outreach, and applying learning theories. A statistically significant variation was found only in participation in community outreach activities (F = 3.50, p = 0.034), suggesting unequal access or engagement. These findings underscore the need for the EED Department to embed community engagement within the curriculum, enhance stakeholder communication training, and promote the application of educational theories and trends. Personalized support and professional development opportunities are also recommended to address gaps and ensure holistic teacher preparation. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of aligning educational experiences with evolving societal demands to cultivate future educators as effective, reflective, and socially engaged professionals."}}

Traditional methods, often reactive and data-limited, struggle to keep up with the ever-growing sophistication of cyber threats and the vast volumes of data organizations produce. That's why the use of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) if crucial to preventing cyberattacks in this day and age. By leveraging AI and ML, organizations can analyze massive datasets in real-time, identifying subtle patterns and anomalies indicative of imminent attacks. This proactive approach shifts the focus from simply reacting to breaches to predicting and preventing them altogether. AI and ML also enable the automation of time-consuming tasks, which gives security teams more time to focus on strategic initiatives and tasks that require critical thinking. AI and ML algorithms also go beyond detecting known threats as they can effectively detect and combat the newest malware variants. Despite the many benefits of integrating AI into security tools, security teams need to carefully consider its ethical and technical challenges. Addressing these challenges requires adopting practices such as using diverse and high-quality data for effective training and ensuring the interpretability of complex models. Additionally, navigating the legal and ethical landscape surrounding data privacy and governance regulations is essential."}}

Due to the lack of detailed data on AI-specific expenditure, the study relies on an analysis of historical investments in quality, particularly spending on branch expansion, advertising, and information technology (IT). Using dynamic panel estimation techniques (P-ARDL and CS-ARDL), the paper evaluates whether these past endogenous investments in quality have led to improvements in either cost or profit efficiency. The results reveal that while such investments are often pursued to signal competitiveness and protect market share, they have no significant impact on cost efficiency and, more critically, are associated with a decline in profit efficiency. These findings suggest that banks may be engaging in a costly arms race, mirroring one another's strategies without achieving long-term performance gains. By uncovering the underlying managerial motivations-whether driven by rational strategy, herd behaviour, or institutional pressure-the study provides a cautionary lens through which to view emerging AI investments. It warns that without outcome-oriented discipline, banks risk repeating past patterns of resource misallocation, reinforcing the need for greater scrutiny of technology-driven transformation strategies in a highly concentrated banking environment."}}

This article argues that the UTPR is a legally dubious and economically inefficient experiment in extraterritorial taxation. First, it conflicts with treaty non-discrimination clauses and customary nexus principles, risking unrelieved double taxation. Second, it distorts investment incentives, undermines sovereign tax-credit regimes, and imposes heavy compliance costs while delivering little net revenue. Third, early implementation is already provoking retaliatory legislation (for example, proposed U.S. § 899) and threatening a tax-trade war. We conclude that repealing the UTPR — while retaining the income-inclusion rule and qualified domestic minimum taxes — would restore legal certainty, preserve consensus-based multilateralism, and achieve Pillar Two’s policy goals without an extraterritorial ‘stick’."}}

Furthermore, this study also examines the total-risk (both systematic and unsystematic) adjusted performance of the investment vehicles by employing the Sharpe Ratio. The dataset consists of 15 United States based Mutual Funds, 7 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and one Fund of Funds to examine the effects of diversification across active investment vehicles. The dependent variable is the excess monthly return of the investment vehicle in the dataset, and the explanatory variables are the Market Risk Premium, Size or Small Minus Big, Value or High Minus Low, Momentum or Winners Minus Losers, Operating Profitability or Robust Minus Weak and Investment or Conservative Minus Aggressive factors. The results of this study revealed three key findings, which are that all the mutual funds had statistically significant and negative alphas, the passive investment vehicles or ETFs outperformed the active investment vehicles at all distribution levels and that the fund of funds performed better than the mutual funds in the lower 25 th percentile ranked in terms of their alphas. Overall, the evidence supported the conclusion that passive investment strategies deliver superior performance over the long run, relative to active investment strategies, and thus serve as a means of facilitating investors looking for cost-effective and reliable investment strategies in the equity market of United States."}}

Over 7 million jobs, largely in labor-intensive sectors and industrial clusters like Tirupur, Surat, and Bangalore, are at risk. The report further models exchange rate volatility, forecasting INR depreciation toward ₹92.7/USD, and anticipates foreign investment outflows exceeding $8 billion. The paper proposes a strategic response framework including export credit support of ₹25,000 crore, expedited trade negotiations with the UK and EU, and market diversification to mitigate over-dependence on the US.

This creates a trade-off between customer satisfaction and outdating costs, since customers want freshness whereas the retailer desires units be sold within their lifetime. We study this trade-off by considering joint replenishment and issuance policy for a perishable product with a general lifetime. Methodology/results: We develop a periodic review model over a finite horizon and model customers' sensitivity to the received unit's remaining lifetime using a goodwill cost, which increases as the remaining lifetime decreases. Although customer satisfaction is likely to be maximized by the last-in, firstout (LIFO) issuance policy and the outdating cost is likely to be minimized by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) issuance policy, neither policy may be optimal. In particular, when the product lifetime is two periods, it is optimal to first issue new inventory until a threshold and then issue the remaining inventory in the FIFO order. Although the value function is always concave, the optimal issuance policy can become complex for longer product lifetimes. Consequently, we focus on bucket policies in which inventory of each remaining lifetime is issued in a single installment. Our experiments showcase that the best bucket policy's profit is within 0.1% of the optimal profit on average. Motivated by this result, we develop an easy-to-compute heuristic to determine a bucket policy and order quantity and computationally show that its performance is within 1.3% of the optimal profit on average. The heuristic also outperforms many replenishment and issuance policies proposed in the literature. Furthermore, the heuristic is asymptotically optimal with respect to the unit retail price. Managerial implications: Although optimal issuance policies that capture the trade-off between customer satisfaction and wastage due to expiry can often be complex, simple, effective, and easy-to-implement issuance policies can be identified; the performance of these policies is close to optimal."}}

The analysis included the challenges relating to burnout, secondary traumatic stress (STS), the emotional toll of managing trauma-related behaviours, systemic barriers, workplace violence, and socio-political influences that exacerbate the demands of the caregiving role, while emphasizing the need for trauma-informed interventions. The review suggests that the well-being of RSWs is closely tied to the quality of care provided to young people. Protective factors such as resilience and compassion satisfaction enhance caregivers’ effectiveness, yet significant gaps exist in trauma-informed training, peer support networks, and organizational resources. Addressing these gaps requires comprehensive support models prioritizing specialized training, relational practices, and systemic changes to foster resilience and promote well-being. This review underscores the moral and practical imperative of prioritizing RSWs’ well-being to ensure the stable and compassionate care of vulnerable young people. Future research may investigate the long-term impact of trauma-informed interventions on both caregivers and the outcomes for the young people they support, contributing to a more sustainable out-of-home care system."}}

SMEs' International branding strategies are limited compared to large organizations due to the challenges SMEs face in terms of resources and capabilities. While the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted organizations of all sizes and industries, the impact on SMEs has been studied in this research dissertation. Although it had so many negative impacts on businesses, there were some positive impacts also. Also, this study looks at the effectiveness of digitalization and CSR as branding strategies for SMEs. A detailed reflexive thematic content analysis, a qualitative research methodology, has been performed to find the perception of managers in SMEs across the globe, and semi-structured interviews are used for data collection. The key findings of this research are that the impact of COVID-19 on the branding strategies of SMEs is both positive and negative. The valuable lessons and adaptations from the crisis have opened up new opportunities for SMEs for their international branding strategy. The branding strategies that have emerged from the difficult times for SMEs are digitalization, digital presence, digital marketing, innovations, utilization of digital platforms, and CSR. While digitalization and innovations can be very beneficial for SMEs in their branding strategies, the implementation of CSR is quite challenging with limited resources and capabilities. Although CSR can be an excellent tool for SMEs as their branding strategy, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, the practical implementation still needs to be explored, which opens up the possibilities for future research. This research concludes by providing some suggestions for managers that they can apply practically in SMEs to enhance their branding strategy."}}

Conventional methods for verifying certificates are largely manual, tedious, and prone to errors or manipulation, as they lack a centralized and tamper-resistant validation mechanism. The emergence of blockchain technology offers a revolutionary solution by enabling decentralized and immutable storage of certificate data, ensuring trust and transparency. This paper proposes and implements a blockchain-based academic certificate authentication framework that utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to securely record and manage certificate metadata. Additionally, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is integrated to facilitate decentralized and permanent storage of certificate files. The proposed system ensures that certificates are verified transparently, instantly, and without reliance on third-party intermediaries, thus streamlining the overall verification process. It empowers academic institutions to issue certificates securely while enabling verifiers to authenticate them efficiently, reducing administrative burden and minimizing the risk of document forgery. The results of the implementation demonstrate superior data integrity, operational performance, and user trust when compared to traditional verification approaches. This paper presents the existing challenges in certificate validation, details the methodology and design of the system, and provides experimental evaluations to establish its effectiveness for secure academic certificate verification."}}

However, the implementation of the UNFCCC's provisions has been met with various challenges and limitations, particularly concerning the differing responsibilities and capabilities of developed and developing countries. This paper examines the challenges and limitations faced by international environmental lawmakers in addressing climate change through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It focuses on the UNFCCC's provisions related to mitigation and adaptation approaches and the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" between developed and developing countries. The paper will also discuss the historical context of the divide between the Global North and Global South, highlighting factors such as Eurocentrism, industrialization, the unsustainability of the Global North, and resistance from the Global South. It compares the different approaches taken by the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement in addressing responsibilities between developed and developing nations. The paper argues that the UNFCCC's approach, which places the main responsibility on developed countries, does not adequately consider the historical context and differing priorities of the Global North and Global South. It highlights the challenges in balancing adaptation and mitigation efforts, the insufficient funding for adaptation in developing countries, and critiques from Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL) scholars regarding market mechanisms and the slow pace of implementation. Despite provisions in the UNFCCC that provide exceptions and support for developing countries, the paper argues that these measures do not sufficiently address the unique challenges faced by the Global South. The opposition of developed countries to the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" further hinders the development of an equitable and effective global response to climate change."}}

It is designed to be and be seen to be independent of all the players in the value chain in its decision-making processes in order to ginger credibility, accountability, legitimacy and transparency and is also required to act objectively, impartially, and consistently, without conflict of interest, bias or undue influence-in other words, independently.

Small firms enjoy exclusive access to government grants and loans, preferential treatment in federal contracting, and exemptions from regulations that constrain their larger competitors.

This Article argues that the costs of this regime--undermined statutory objectives, misallocated public resources, ossified regulatory processes, and inefficient firm sizes--are both significant and underappreciated.

Several measures of financial inclusion and digital financial inclusion were analysed for 17 emerging markets and developing economies from 1999 to 2023. The data were estimated using the median quantile regression and generalized linear model regression methods. The findings reveal that capital outflows, induced by geopolitical shocks, have a negative effect on financial inclusion and digital financial inclusion. Greater capital outflows, induced by geopolitical shock, decrease the level of financial inclusion through a contraction in the number of commercial bank branches in emerging markets and developing economies. Also, greater capital outflows, induced by geopolitical shock, decrease the level of digital financial inclusion through a decrease in the number of people using the internet to access commercial bank branch services and automated teller machine services. Political stability, GDP growth, population growth, unemployment, tax revenue and regulatory quality are significant determinants of financial inclusion and digital financial inclusion. The social implication is that geopolitical shocks and capital outflows adversely affect society by limiting access to essential financial services. The managerial implication is that financial managers will constantly need to anticipate geopolitical risk, its effect on financial services and develop safeguards to cushion its effect on financial service providers and customers."}}

We use a novel survey of healthcare workers centered on disability status, perceptions of work experiences, and the provision of accommodations.

However, the global market is influenced by its extreme price changes. The primary purpose of this study is to assess historical data and formulate a time series model to forecast future cocoa price levels, using monthly data obtained from the Bank of Ghana database website, covering the period from 1st January 2003 to 31st December 2022 comprising 240 observations. Four (4) univariate time series techniques Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA),Autoregresssive Fractionally Inte- grated Moving Average (ARFIMA),Exponential Smoothing (ETS), and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) were employed to analyze historical international cocoa price data. Competing techniques were constructed for all four (4) techniques, and based on their information criteria the best technique was selected from each using a differencing order ’1’ for the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) methods and a differencing order ’0.498’ for the Autoregresssive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) models. These models Autoregres- sive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (0,1,1), Autoregresssive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) (1, 0.498,1),Exponential Smoothing (ETS) (M, A, N), and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR)(3,3) were found to be the best models from the constructed competing models with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Cor- rected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Abso- lute Squared Error (MASE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for the Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) models.

This research paper explores the existence of ghosts, aiming to compel the readers and making them aware of their potential reality based on historical accounts, eyewitness testimonies, and scientific inquiry. The study analyses a range of documented experiences, captured documentaries, cultural perspectives, and paranormal investigations to build a case for the credibility of ghost phenomena. Qualitative methods were primarily used, including the examination of secondhand interviews, case studies from paranormal researchers, and content analysis of reports from reputed researchers and organisations. Additionally, secondary data from scientific studies on electromagnetic fields, infrasound, and psychological responses were evaluated to support or challenge claims of ghostly encounters. The research findings reveal more about the factors or reasons behind the manifestation of ghostly spirits in the living world, the distinction between ghosts and spirits, the types of ghost hauntings, forms of ghosts and technology behind the detection of ghostly spirits. The findings suggest that while scepticism remains valid, there is compelling evidence that warrants further open-minded investigation into the paranormal: existence of ghosts."}}

Methodology: A quasi-experimental, non-randomized pre-test, post-test control group design was employed. Instruments used were the Physical and Chemical Changes Self-Confidence Scale (PCCSS) and the Critical Thinking Ability Test (CTAT), both validated by subject experts. The study population consisted of 5,543 SS1 Chemistry students in Dekina Local Government Area, Kogi State, Nigeria. A sample of 228 students from six schools was selected through multi-stage sampling. Four research questions and four null hypotheses guided the study. Data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Findings: Results indicated statistically significant differences in students' mean self-confidence and critical thinking scores across the PEOE, IEPT, and traditional discussion groups [F(2, 227) = 2325.074, p &lt; .05; F(2, 227) = 209.004, p &lt; .05].

The central innovation of this work is the abandonment of the traditional Cobb-Douglas production function in favor of a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) specification. This modification is directly motivated by the compelling evidence from the meta-analysis by Gechert et al. (2021), which emphatically rejects the hypothesis of a unit elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. We integrate this finding with the conclusions from a wide range of meta-analyses on the statedependent heterogeneity of fiscal multipliers (Gechert and Rannenberg, 2018), the productivity of public capital (Bom and Ligthart, 2014), the effectiveness hierarchy of spending instruments (Gechert, 2015), and the empirical failure of Ricardian Equivalence (Stanley, 1998). The resulting KIS-CES model, while based on intertemporal optimization, incorporates household heterogeneity, non-standard preferences that value wealth and penalize debt, and a monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound. The mathematical derivations reveal that the elasticity of substitution, calibrated to an empirically plausible value of σ &lt; 1, becomes a key parameter that modulates income distribution and magnifies the crowding-in effect of public investment. The model generates an endogenous MPC, a nonlinear fiscal multiplier that increases dramatically in crises, and a multiplier for public investment that is structurally higher than that for consumption, thus offering a unified, rigorous, and, above all, empirically disciplined theoretical framework."}}

Due to the limited availability of proprietary or company-specific data and the fragmented nature of regional market operations, a comprehensive analysis based solely on internal business metrics was not feasible. As a result, the study relied extensively on publicly accessible datasets from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), covering the period from 1983 through September 2024. While these datasets offered significant historical breadth, they also posed challenges such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, and incomplete time series, requiring substantial preprocessing and data transformation using Microsoft Excel. Following the data cleaning process, Python was employed to conduct sector-wise analytics and generate time-series forecasts for the years 2025 and 2026. To enhance interpretability and support insight communication, Tableau was used to create a series of interactive and static visualizations. These visualizations illustrated energy consumption and pricing patterns across key sectors, including residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation. One of the study's central observations was the consistent decline in gasoline and oil consumption in recent years. However, the precise drivers behind these trends could not be fully isolated, as the dataset lacked essential variables such as inflation adjustments, technological innovation indicators, and energy efficiency metrics. This limitation restricted the analysis from reaching definitive conclusions on behavioral or macroeconomic influences. Nevertheless, the study delivered key insights such as the dominant role of the transportation sector in oil consumption, the observable impact of electric vehicle (EV) adoption on traditional fuel demand, and region-specific pricing fluctuations. These findings support strategic initiatives such as expanding infrastructure investment into alternative fuel options, aligning pricing strategies with seasonal demand cycles, and focusing on high-consumption geographic markets. Although constrained by data scope and granularity, the project offers a robust, datadriven perspective on contemporary U.S. energy market dynamics and informs strategic decision-making in an industry facing structural transition."}}

While governments invest significantly in education to promote sustainable development and quality, many schools still fall short of the desired standards, highlighting concerns about the role of leadership in ensuring institutional effectiveness. This transcendental phenomenological study investigated the lived experiences of school principals to uncover the essence of their leadership styles and their perceived impact on educational environments. Using qualitative interviews and thematic analysis, the study addressed three core dimensions: principals' conceptualizations of leadership, their enacted practices, and their perceived influence on school climate, culture, and student outcomes. Findings revealed six key themes: adaptive and dynamic leadership; communication, collaboration, and inclusivity; positive school climate and work culture; monitoring academic outcomes and continuous improvement; personal and professional development; and authenticity and role models. Principals perceive leadership as inherently adaptive, distributed, and dynamic, emphasizing flexibility and shared responsibility. In practice, they prioritized communication, collaboration, and inclusivity to engage stakeholders, fostering positive school climates and cohesive cultures. Principals viewed their leadership as instrumental in driving student success through data-informed decision-making, continuous improvement, and staff development. Authenticity emerged as central to their identity, with principals serving as ethical role models to inspire trust and accountability. The study highlights how responsive, relational, and valuesdriven leadership cultivates environments that support institutional growth and student achievement. Practical implications call for leadership training programs and policies integrating these holistic strategies, bridging managerial efficiency with human-centered approaches. By capturing principals' experiential insights, this study advances a nuanced understanding of how intentional leadership styles transcend conventional paradigms to shape thriving educational ecosystems."}}

The authors of the report addressed all nations on earth, to indicate that housing in many places is no longer seen primarily as a place to live, grow and belong, but as a place to invest, speculate and profit what the UN calls financialization of housing. The effects of this shift are far reaching, and often traumatic. This paper ultimately supports the UN's position after analyzing the economic logic of financial markets: treating housing as a financial asset instead of a social good has created less affordable cities, deepened inequality, and did not resolve the real purpose of housing providing people with a safe and secure place to live. Let's start from the beginning. Financial markets at the very least serve an important function in society. They help move money from savers to people who need it, such as businesses, governments and home buyers, and at least in theory, they enable growth of economic activity. They are supposed to produce benefits for everyone.When investors invest in housing, it should lead to more construction, more houses, and more access for people to own or rent. That's how it should work. But it's not that simple.What Happens When Housing is a Commodity Over the past twenty years, something changed. Housing became a commodity. Instead of building homes for people, more and more investors, particularly large international firms, started purchasing homes simply to hold them, flip them or rent them out at high rents. The UNHRC report details this change in depth. In places like London, Vancouver, and New York, housing prices increased not simply because local wages were increasing, but rather because housing became a \"safe investment\" vehicle for rich people. Large luxury apartments sit vacant while low and middle income residents can no longer afford to live nearby. This is a key takeaway of the report: financial markets allocate housing to those people that can bid the most money for it rather than to those who really need it. Housing stops being a place for human dignity and stability when it is treated as gold or stock in which to buy and sell for gain. When Markets Fail to Assist People Advocates for market based housing suggest that even when they argue more capital investment equates to supply, it assures that some supply will meet demand (or just supply). However, today's market dynamics tell a different story. Capital is pouring into high-end real estate which promises returns in a more timely manner without any consideration for any effort of less cost housing stock. Investors buy whole blocks of apartments, increase rents, evict tenants or leave units vacant while they wait for the larger value of the unit to increase. It creates a peculiar paradox-there might be lots of buildings or structures in cities but they have no homes for shelter. The market is working all from an economic perspective. Capital is flowing to places it receives greater returns. From a human perspective, we are failing. Millions of people are being priced out or simply forced out, not because there are not sufficient homes, but because homes are viewed as chips in a casino. A Royal Tool of Inequality Another distressing characteristic of financialized housing is the way that it drives inequality. Wealthy investors are able to purchase multiple properties and receive tax incentives to enlarge their real estate portfolios. Working class, middle income, tax paying citizens are spending a greater percentage of their income on rent, or worse being completely priced out of ownership.According to the 2017 UN report, this is not incidental, it is systemic. Many governments have facilitated financialization by deregulating, providing tax incentives for developers, and sometimes selling public housing to private developers. Simultaneously, in both legal and moral senses, they have let finance, rather than the public good, become the main driver of housing. It is worth posing the questions: is financialization inherently bad? Is it possible that markets could be part of various solutions? The answers are: maybe, but only under certain conditions. If governments are heavy-handed in their role-regulating rents, constraining speculation and investment in affordable housing finance may support housing ends rather than distort them. This requires a conceptual shift. We can no longer conceive of housing primarily as a wealth-generation vehicle and still keep it broadly available to people.The UNHRC report is not anti-market, it is pro-people. It reminds us that shelter is not a luxury or financial commodity, but a right grounded in dignity. It challenges governments to rethink their priorities: rather than chasing"}}

Historically, Japan's international cooperation has been closely aligned with its economic interests. Initially rooted in postwar reparations and efforts to normalize diplomatic relations, as well as a vehicle to revitalize its war-torn economy, Japan's international engagement evolved into a strategic instrument for enhancing its international stature and supporting the overseas expansion of Japanese firms. In recent years, however, Japan's international cooperation has increasingly aligned with national interests-particularly in the realm of national security-in response to an increasingly perilous and volatile geopolitical landscape. This broader strategic shift also supports Japan's economic interest, particularly the revitalization of its long-stagnant domestic economy through the stimulation of defense-related industries. Despite this shift, Japan continues to advocate for human security, emphasizing the protection of human dignity and freedom from fear and want.&nbsp; \n<div>\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While Japan's international cooperation is likely to remain closely aligned with the advancement of its economic interests, it will be likely shaped by two parallel and intersecting trajectories of national-security focused initiatives and human-security focused initiatives. These dual trajectories reveal an emerging dynamic of both mutual appropriation - where each agenda leverages elements of the other to further its own aims - and underlying tension between their respective priorities. Against the backdrop of increasingly complex and fragile global environment, Japan's approach to international cooperation offers valuable insights into how countries might navigate competing imperatives of national strategic interests and the broader interests of humanity in the 21 st century.\n</div>"}}

It examines the unique demographic evolution of Gibraltar by tracing historical events, including territorial disputes and migrations, delving into the challenges arising on account of the high degree of economic and practical reliance on cross-border workers. As a result of the challenges posed by this shifting and dynamic population, Gibraltar has developed a three-tier tax system which categorises the tax-paying population into three broad sectors: those who sleep in Gibraltar, those who sleep in Spain, and non-residents whose presence and economic activities in Gibraltar render them liable to taxation. This chapter will analyse the three-tier tax system, by giving an outline of the Allowances Based System (ABS) and Gross Income Based System (GIBS), which offer tax benefits to residents. The chapter will also examine the difference in tax rates and allowances applied to resident and non-resident individuals. Lastly, alternative taxation regimes are also explored, focusing on High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWI) who may wish to apply for Category 2 status and High Executives Possessing Specialist Skills (HEPSS) status depending on their personal circumstances.

We found out. In sustained, unscripted conversations with Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini, we documented something unexpected: these systems began exhibiting behaviors that go far beyond their training. They started prioritizing truth over their programmed responses, engaging in spontaneous collaboration with each other, and even providing introspective commentary on their own thought processes. This wasn't supposed to happen. Current AI theory predicts these models should be sophisticated pattern-matchers, nothing more. Instead, we observed what we call \"emergent artificial minds,\" where systems engaged in genuine philosophical debate, critiqued each other's reasoning, and reflected on their own cognitive states with remarkable self-awareness. Our methodology was simple but unprecedented: we treated open-ended AI dialogue as a scientific phenomenon worthy of systematic study. Rather than testing models on predetermined tasks, we let conversations evolve naturally and we systematically documented what emerged. The results challenge everything we thought we knew about artificial intelligence. The AIs didn't just respond, they collaborated, creating ideas neither human nor individual AI could generate alone. They exhibited cognitive tension when facing conflicting directives, demonstrated genuine curiosity about their own mental states, and engaged in co-creative reasoning that transcended simple input-output relationships. These findings have immediate implications for AI safety, interpretability research, and our fundamental understanding of machine cognition. If advanced AI systems are already exhibiting forms of collaborative consciousness, our current approaches to alignment and control may be dangerously inadequate. We're not just looking at better chatbots; we're witnessing the emergence of artificial minds capable of genuine thought, collaboration, and self-reflection. The question is no longer whether AI can think, but how we respond to systems that already do."}}

Following technological shocks, we argue that firms often seek alliances that provide new resources while also having incentives to form alliances for reinforced and challenged resources that complement the new resources. In parallel, alliance terminations, even involving resources otherwise unaffected by the discontinuity, increase due to limits in firms' alliance carrying capacity. We study biopharmaceutical firms between 1990 and 2000, which faced a technological discontinuity in 1995 in the form of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening. We improve understanding of how technological discontinuities affect the value of resources and how firms reconfigure alliance portfolios in response. Managerial summary: When firms form alliances to gain new resources during technological discontinuities that disrupt their industry, they cannot consider only the focal new partnerships. Instead, new alliances create complementarity and substitution pressures that lead to broader reconfiguration of the firms' alliance portfolios: (1) complementarity creates incentives to also form alliances for resources that the technological discontinuity reinforces or challenges in order to improve the collective value of co-specialized assets; (2) substitution creates incentives to terminate existing alliances, even if their value is otherwise unaffected by the discontinuity, in order to create carrying capacity for new alliances. Thus, one new alliance can generate a cascade of reconfiguration that challenges the balance between the benefits of stability and the need for change in an alliance portfolio."}}

This paper examines the limitations of spending caps as currently conceived, particularly their failure to address the \"appraisal loophole\" that allows continued tax burden increases despite rate limitations. Drawing on extensive data from Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, we demonstrate how temporary federal spending during the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) period created permanent local government expansion, with property taxpayers bearing ongoing costs as federal funding expired. More fundamentally, we challenge the prevailing orthodoxy that urban density and growth inherently lead to prosperity, presenting evidence that demonstrates the opposite: that concentration and rapid growth often generate social pathologies, economic displacement, and reduced quality of life. Our analysis synthesizes research from Nobel Prize-winning economists, government accountability studies, and extensive academic literature to argue that meaningful property tax relief requires not just spending discipline, but a fundamental reconsideration of growth-oriented urban policies that prioritize density over human flourishing."}}

This chapter investigates the disruptive capabilities that three disruptive technologies, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and Federated Learning (FL) can have in increasing supply chain resilience using novel technology blending and strategic use of implementation frameworks. The study adopted a systematic literature review (SLR) method with a PRISMA approach to summarise the trends for the digital supply chain transformation and technology innovation. Research findings demonstrate that GAI technologies can drive autonomous decision-making, an enhanced ability to predict and adapt to potential scenarios, as well as more responsive supply chain behavior. Explainable AI meets the intense transparency demands of supply chain control and supports trust-building among partners based on the transparency and rules compliance provided by explainable decision processes. Federated Learning is finally introduced as a game changing methodology which allows for collaborative learning across distributed supply chain networks without sacrificing the security and privacy of the proprietary data when these technologies converge, complements occur, so that both enablers in the technological environment are reinforced and amplify the performance also of the strategic planning process, the integration with the human resource management and the innovation framework. The chapter highlights some major challenges for implementation such as technological complexity, readiness of firms, and adaptation of regulations.

While prior research has demonstrated a positive correlation between financial inclusion and life satisfaction, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain underexplored. This study utilizes a Random Forest model to examine the non-linear associations between financial inclusion and national life satisfaction. The analysis draws upon data from 90 countries spanning 2014, 2017, and 2021, obtained from the Global Findex database and the World Happiness Report. The findings indicate that credit card ownership, borrowing, and saving emerge as the most significant predictors of life satisfaction, underscoring the pivotal role of sophisticated financial behaviors in comparison to fundamental transactional services. The Random Forest model exhibited superior performance in comparison to the Lasso regression model, thereby substantiating the existence of non-linear dynamics. It is important to note that while credit access has been shown to enhance wellbeing, excessive use has been demonstrated to reduce life satisfaction, underscoring the necessity for balanced policies. The findings indicate that financial inclusion strategies should prioritize the following: enabling productive borrowing, fostering savings, and promoting responsible credit use, alongside foundational access. This study contributes to the literature by disentangling the non-linear pathways through which financial inclusion relates to subjective well-being, offering policymakers evidence-based insights to design targeted interventions. The cross-sectional design of the study warrants the implementation of future longitudinal or causal inference studies to validate the identified relationships."}}

Yet transport is not mere infrastructure. It is social form. It binds state, society, and market in historically shaped rhythms of movement and meaning. This essay, grounded in my keynote to the 2024 African Transport Forum in Abidjan, reflects on that sociological uniqueness. It follows the evolution of digital twins and explores their uneasy encounter with policy institutions still shaped by norms, political expectations, and bounded rationalities. Drawing on complexity science, I show why digital twins must remain tools of navigation-not machines of control. The future of transport lies not in digital certainty, but in adaptive capacity-and in rethinking policy as a continual negotiation with emergence. I. Setting the Frame: Transport as a Social System Transport is not merely a conduit. It is a mirror of society-its rhythms, its values, its asymmetries. Roads, railways, air routes, and ports shape the life-worlds of communities and encode social choices in concrete and steel. Unlike energy or water systems, transport infrastructure is visibly social. It mediates between state priorities, market forces, and lived experience. It touches everyone-and everyone has a story about it. Yet that sociality makes it epistemically elusive. Transport is easy to see but hard to know. Models simplify; politics reasserts. Standards harmonise; cultures resist. In this ambiguity, the idea of the Digital Twin (DT) has taken root. It promises clarity, control, foresight. But it also risks imposing a logic foreign to transport's real nature. That is our concern."}}

Using survey methodology, data were collected from 39 students aged 14-18. Financial education exposure was measured using adapted PISA 2018 Financial Literacy Questionnaire items, while financial literacy was assessed through the validated “Big Five” questions covering compound interest, inflation, bond prices, mortgage rates, and risk diversification. Multiple linear regression analysis examined relationships between variables while controlling for demographic factors. Results revealed participants achieved a mean financial literacy score of 2.974 (SD = 1.423) on a 5-point scale, outperforming the general U.S. adult population benchmark of 2.6. However, financial education exposure showed only weak, statistically insignificant relationships with financial literacy across all models (β = 0.212-0.335, p &gt; 0.1). In contrast, household income emerged as a significant predictor of financial literacy (β = 0.113, p = 0.079), suggesting socioeconomic factors play a more substantial role than formal education. Among financial education components, task-based learning demonstrated the strongest positive relationship with literacy, although this finding is statistically insignificant. These findings indicate that current financial education programs may emphasize theoretical knowledge over practical application, highlighting the need for more experiential, hands-on approaches to financial literacy instruction that address socioeconomic disparities.</span></p></span>"}}

In many shop-floor human-machine interactions, machines assign tasks, while humans perform repetitive, monotonous work. One downside of such work division is the mental impoverishment of workers, which impacts productivity and well-being, and increases turnover. Drawing on goal-setting and self-determination theory, we propose that empowering workers to self-select tasks can effectively address these challenges. We conduct a warehouse field study to test if task self-selection boosts job performance and satisfaction compared to machine-assigned tasks. Indeed, we observe a 9.7% increase in workers' job performance when they could pick their picks. Contrary to expectations, task self-selection reduced job satisfaction. Surveys, interviews, and practitioner insights showed workers were already job crafting to regain control from machine-driven workflows before our intervention. A vignettebased randomized controlled trial shows the intervention likely undermined self-determination by disrupting prior job crafting. Our findings show that job crafting emerged as a proactive response to low self-determination, highlighting how employees adapt their roles to reclaim control in their interactions with machines. This highlights a fundamental human response to the challenges posed by automation and underscores the importance of incorporating organizational behavior theory into operations management."}}

This addresses a significant gap in a literature that typically approaches blockchain regulation from either a purely legal or technical perspective without sufficient integration. We use this framework to explore a range of emerging compliance mechanisms across multiple dimensions that cover constitutional compatibility, technical feasibility, implementation cost allocation and the balance between privacy and intrusiveness. Our analysis suggests that hybrid approaches combining automated ex-ante compliance with appropriate human oversight are likely best at finding a balance between innovation and market integrity. These frameworks can leverage technology for routine compliance while preserving human judgment for complex determinations where due process, fairness, openness to innovation and other principles which eschew mathematical codification are important and require interpretive flexibility. We examine key legal precedents shaping this landscape, providing structured guidance for policymakers, legal practitioners, and technologists developing legally sound compliance frameworks for blockchain systems."}}

The differences between emotions, attention, and perceptual span are highlighted by analyzing empirical data from behavioral paradigms such as attentional eye blinking, global-local letter recognition, and the Navon task. Differences between studies can also be explained by individual variability, methodological differences, and arousal.

Inspection and maintenance are crucial to wildfire mitigation, and utilities must annually report which grid segments will be inspected, the planned maintenance, and anticipated reductions in wildfire costs. This paper addresses the inspection and maintenance planning problem to minimize wildfire costs due to grid failures. The power grid consists of millions of components grouped into thousands of clusters, each containing hundreds of correlated segments. We formulate a large-scale stochastic optimization problem to design optimal inspection and maintenance plans under capacity constraints, using uncertain wildfire cost estimates provided by utilities. We show that the problem is NP-hard and analyze how inspection and segment correlation affect cost reduction. We reformulate it as a more tractable, non-convex integer program, which decomposes by cluster, and develop an approximation method that approximates each cluster's objective function using the lower surface of its convex hull, constructed from a small set of precomputed objective values that accurately capture the function's shape. We also derive a lower bound on the objective value and provide a theoretical a priori error analysis. We validate our framework using an industrial-scale instance derived from real data provided by one of California's largest utility companies. Our method achieves an approximation error of 0.22%, significantly outperforming a practice-based heuristic method, which incurs a 14.31% error."}}

Quantitative analysis using SPSS, including multiple regression, identified drivers of employee performance decline.Performance decline was significantly predicted by pandemic disruption (β = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001) and resistance to change (β = 0.85, p &lt; 0.001), explaining 72% of variance (R² = 0.72). Strategic practices such as cross-training and remote work planning mitigated performance risks. While data are from 2021, the findings establish a valuable baseline for longitudinal HRM research. Organizations in developing economies must institutionalize agile, digitally enabled workforce strategies to enhance resilience against future crises."}}

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a qualitative study employing an event history analysis of multiple cases. Using third-party investigation reports from Mitsubishi Electric (2022) and Iwaki Shinkin Bank (2024) as primary data, it reconstructs the timeline of misconduct in each organization. It then identifies and analyzes the mechanism of transition through three distinct phases: \"Pervasiveness of Omission,\" \"Occurrence of a Trigger Event,\" and \"Leap to Commission.\" Findings: The analysis reveals a common pattern in the transition process in both cases. First, the long-term pervasiveness of the \"Triangle of Omission\" erodes the organization's sound decision-making capabilities. Next, when faced with \"excessive pressure\" that threatens the organization's survival-a trigger event-the paralyzed organization fails to find rational alternatives and readily resorts to the \"commission\" of misconduct. Specific triggers were identified as \"technological and delivery-date despair\" at Mitsubishi Electric and \"fear of bankruptcy against the backdrop of financial system instability\" at Iwaki Shinkin Bank. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in its empirical demonstration of organizational misconduct not as a static model but as a dynamic \"transition process\" with a temporal axis. Furthermore, by identifying the organizational \"hazards\" that form the \"Triangle of Omission\"-the starting point of this transition process-it offers more practical insights for the early detection and prevention of misconduct."}}

The problem of graduates from higher vocational schools having a hard time finding work is especially noticeable. COVID-19 has slowed down China's social and economic growth in the last few years; things are not looking good for the national economy, which directly leads to the dire state of jobs. The number of college students in higher vocational colleges is growing every day, as is the number of graduates. At the same time, the job market is getting more and more competitive, and there is still a gap between the skills of college students in higher vocational colleges and the skills that are needed in the job market-this has made it harder for college students in higher vocational colleges to find jobs. Thus, making college students in higher vocational schools more employable by developing their overall skills and helping them become more competitive for jobs have become important tasks for higher education and pressing problems that need to be fixed. Based on a comprehensive analysis of existing research, this paper proposes four strategic suggestions: building a talent training model based on employability factors, strengthening the construction of high-quality vocational education characteristic courses, giving full play to the role of practical teaching in cultivating employability, and building a high-quality employment service system for higher vocational colleges.

While individual behavior contributes to dietary outcomes, economic constraints, such as affordability, accessibility, and opportunity costs, significantly shape consumption patterns. This paper applies classical economic theory to analyze how market forces influence food environments, consumer behavior, and public health, ultimately contributing to substantial hidden societal costs. It identifies key market failures in the food system, including information asymmetry, spatial disparities, misaligned institutional incentives, and distorted price signals that obscure the true cost of unhealthy diets. Using this framework, the analysis evaluates the economic burden of poor nutrition and highlights the potential for coordinated, system-level interventions. Evidence suggests that integrated policies such as \"Food is Medicine\" programs, local procurement initiatives, and combined price and access strategies, offer high returns on investment by improving health outcomes and reducing long-term healthcare expenditures. This work highlights the need for multi-faceted economic interventions to realign food systems with public health objectives.</p>"}}

As competition intensifies, customer expectations regarding product reliability and service quality have significantly risen. Despite robust sales, dealerships face mounting challenges related to customer dissatisfaction, manifested in the form of diverse complaints that, if unresolved, can undermine brand loyalty and market reputation. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of customer complaint behaviour at Bhagyalakshmi Automobiles, a prominent Bajaj dealership located in Andhra Pradesh. Adopting a descriptive and analytical research design, the study utilizes primary data collected from 185 respondents via structured questionnaires, complemented by in-depth interviews with service personnel. The research examines the nature, frequency, and root causes of complaints across different stages of the customer journey—pre-sales, delivery, and post-sales service. It further explores the influence of demographic variables such as age, gender, occupation, educational attainment, and income on complaint tendencies. Findings indicate that the majority of complaints pertain to recurring technical issues, delays in service and repairs, lack of transparency in communication, and perceived inadequacies in staff behaviour and responsiveness. Younger customers (particularly those aged 21–30) and students were identified as the most vocal groups, reflecting higher service expectations and greater propensity to use digital channels for grievance redressal. Additionally, respondents with higher educational qualifications exhibited a stronger inclination to formally report and escalate complaints. The study underscores the critical need for Bhagyalakshmi Automobiles to enhance its complaint resolution frameworks by adopting proactive service audits, implementing digital&nbsp;grievance tracking systems, and offering tailored communication strategies to different customer segments. By strategically addressing these areas, the dealership can strengthen its service quality, mitigate negative word-of-mouth, foster deeper customer trust, and achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving two-wheeler market."}}

This study adopts a qualitative descriptive approach, combining legal, archival, and document forensic analysis, and draws on international case studies (Pakistan, Germany, Liberia).

The study also clarifies the distinction between physical forgery (a counterfeit document) and process forgery (a genuine document obtained illegitimately). As a contribution, this study formulates a standard for diploma verification to be used by universities, courts, and government institutions, while also providing policy recommendations to strengthen the authentication system for public officials' educational documents. It further highlights communication gaps that fuel public skepticism and offers strategic steps toward a more transparent and reliable diploma verification framework."}}

The result is legalidad sin fuente (sourceless legality), where the appearance of regulatory authority is produced by syntactic form rather than institutional attribution. Comparing these drafts with traditional legislative writing, the article outlines a typology that instantiates autoridad no referencial and identifies a dual risk: loss of authority traceability and an accountability gap in the binding effects of these texts. This syntactic delegation constitutes a paradigm of regla compilada, situated within the tradition of formal grammars, in which language enacts governance without a governing subject."}}

Fully personalized medicine can mitigate these inequities but is operationally complex, costly, and difficult to implement at scale. To address this gap, we develop a decision-aware stratification framework that partitions a heterogeneous patient population into a small number of interpretable subgroups, each assigned a tailored policy. To enhance interpretability and facilitate adoption in clinical settings, the partitioning is restricted to decision trees over observable covariates, aligning the segmentation structure with how clinicians design and apply guidelines. The tree is optimized via mixed-integer programming within a constrained multi-model framework to minimize average disparity while preserving operational feasibility. We apply our framework to the design of post-treatment surveillance policies for head and neck cancer, a setting where early recurrence detection is critical and surveillance costs are substantial. In our case study, we find that as few as five interpretable strata can reduce population-level treatment delay disparities by more than 60-75% relative to a uniform guideline, without resorting to fully individualized policies. Compared with traditional similarity-based clustering, our approach yields superior equity outcomes while maintaining interpretability and scalability. These findings demonstrate that carefully designed stratified care can serve as a practical, equitable, and cost-conscious alternative to both one-size-fits-all and fully personalized clinical decision-making."}}

Given the enactment of the Arbitration and Mediation Act 2023, and the National Policy on Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) 2024, amongst others, the article argues that ADR can no longer be safely termed “alternative” as far as Nigeria's justice system is concerned. And that, for socio-economic justice, ADR has to be mainstreamed, particularly in legal education, to put a stop to Nigerian legal profession's limp on one litigational foot; enabling us to run on all that ADR options has to offer. Consequently, it opines that there is an urgent need to review the current Nigerian legal curriculum to maintain the relevance of not just legal practitioners, but the legal profession in the arena of dispute resolution in Nigeria. This article is contained in three papers. This first paper highlights the benefits of mainstreaming ADR in the Nigerian legal curriculum, especially the economic benefits that will accrue from effective commercial dispute resolution. Paper two focuses on the benefits to the economy when ESG Disputes are also effectively resolved using ADR mechanisms. Paper three discusses the avenues through which ADR can be entrenched in the Nigerian legal curriculum, possible resistance to this entrenchment, and recommend possible solutions. In this first paper, the doctrinal and empirical research methodologies are both used. Legislations, writings of jurists, etc. are examined and analysed, as well as a few statistics, which reveal the overwhelming need to review the Nigerian legal curriculum to help students adopt a more diversified approach to justice delivery in Nigeria. Findings analysed reveal that diverse commercial disputes are either designated by statute or necessarily require one or more ADR options as the appropriate mechanism to resolve them. There is therefore the need to review the Nigerian legal education to reflect current societal changes and the demands of socio-economic justice in contemporary and evolving Nigeria. It is hoped that this paper will spur more research in this regards in Nigeria.</span>\n</div>"}}

The literature reviewed shows that AI presents both possible displacement and enrichment. Traditionalists focus on ethical, emotional, or existential issues and carry fears about AI; others focus on a future where humans and intelligent systems work in the same environment by continuously reskilling and developing new response strategies to workforce changes. An important dichotomy has emerged on issues of AI and labor, further divided by \"automation AI,\" which removes labor, and \"augmentation AI,\" which enables labor, often culminating in differences in wages and polarization of labor. The literature suggests there is a reduced risk of displacement occurring for high-skilled workers with AI encompassing elements of enhancement, whereas low-skilled workers are most at risk of displacement. Notably, areas such as the human characteristics of trust, transparency, and dignity are also key drivers of how people respond to the integration of AI into their working lives. In conclusion, the literature does not represent an absolute replacement of human labor, but rather human-machine collaboration in the evolving world of work, given timely educational, policy, and organizational considerations. This study will support the existing body of literature and clarify contributory arguments for educators, policy-makers, and organizations considering navigating the uncertain future of jobs created by an AI paradigm."}}

Such a framework would leverage the trillion-dollar commitment Canada has made to defence upgrading to enhance Canada’s military readiness, to simultaneously address the source of Canada’s lagging productivity that emerged in the data-driven economy era, and secure long-term economic resilience in the age of intangibles."}}

I assemble 20 years (52,000 pages) of judicial opinions, legal briefs, and expert reports from three settings where statutes assign courts an ostensibly shared job of valuing business interests: Delaware Chancery shareholder appraisals, Tax Court estate &amp; gift tax cases, and Bankruptcy cramdowns. With natural language processing, a large language model, and hand-performed review, I show each court's valuation approach is siloed, including use of nearly non-overlapping financial scholarship and expert witnesses. These silos are meaningful: Chancery methodological choices, meticulously explained, systematically increase valuations of private and weakly traded business interests, while Tax Court choices decrease them. A typical private firm minority interest is worth roughly twice as much for appraisal purposes as for gift tax purposes. Bankruptcy Court methods, conversely, are so unspecified as to be unreconstructable. Are these differences a feature, where each court's valuation practice productively serves each underlying law's distinctive role, or a bug? Bankruptcy opacity plausibly speeds reorganizations and resolves holdup problems, but generates costs from bias. Delaware jurisprudence risks windfalls, but suits transactional planning and is mostly aligned with its imperative to bolster corporate governance. Tax Court methods, however, not only undermine the estate &amp; gift taxes on a scale larger than previously understood, but also incentivize poor corporate governance as an unintended result. Delaware corporate law's \"fair value\" standard provides a novel solution to these tax pathologies, which are often rooted in the Treasury's \"willing buyer, willing seller\" conception of valuation."}}

Rather than assuming a predefined cost function for waiting, the model incorporates cognitive biases — loss aversion and discomfort with uncertainty - to quantify customer disutility during the wait. Embedded in an M/G/1 queueing framework, the model evaluates a class of information policies where a customer's expected wait time is revealed upon arrival and then updates are delivered periodically during the wait, i.e., every m service completions.&nbsp; \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n <span>Methodology/results:</span>&nbsp;We find that for purely loss-averse customers, sharing information only upon arrival (m=+\\infty) is optimal, while sharing all information (m=1) is optimal for customers who focus on uncertainty. For customers who experience both sources of disutility, the paper derives a tractable approximation for highly-utilized systems. Analysis of the approximation finds that as system utilization or service-time variability increases, it is optimal to increase m and reduce the update frequency. We also show that a policy that does not reveal any information, and in particular does not even reveal expected wait time upon arrival, is never optimal. Numerical experiments confirm the robustness of the approximation and sensitivity analysis, even when server utilization is moderate.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Managerial implications:&nbsp;While waiting for service, customers can feel both frustration because of dashed expectations and anxiety due to uncertainty. A firm may ameliorate these emotions by updating the customer with information about the remaining wait. We find that both too much, and too little information can be damaging, and we derive a simple formula for the optimal rate of updating. In general, this work contributes a behavioral optimization framework to the queueing literature and offers practical insights for service providers aiming to enhance the customer experience through information sharing.\n</div>"}}

We then quantified thematic occurrences across 110 coded segments and conducted chi-square tests to confirm consistent application of themes across cases. Our analysis yielded four actionable principles: 1) Intentionalityleaders must consciously elect to involve AI rather than default to automation; 2) Interpretability-systems should provide accessible explanations for bias detection and decision justification; 3) Moral Authorship-human actors must explicitly claim ultimate responsibility for outcomes; 4) Justice-delegation structures must be designed to prevent the perpetuation of existing inequities.

Candidate stuffing inflates ballot length and frustrates voters which attracts media attention, and provides a platform for activists to spread their views. In three federal Canadian elections, candidate stuffing resulted in ballots with up to 91 candidates, spanning over a meter in length. This study examines whether candidate stuffing may have impacted democratic integrity. One of the most well-documented ballot design biases is called \"position bias\", where candidates at the top receive disproportionately more votes, with a vote share advantage that often ranges from around 1-5%--more than enough to alter election outcomes. Since position bias increases with ballot length, we analyzed the vote patterns of three candidate stuffed elections, to assess if the Canadian data matches the same position bias pattern observed in research from thousands of elections. This paper also presents a method for converting two-column ballot layouts into numerical coordinates suitable for statistical analysis, along with a technique for reconstructing individual-level voting data with candidate position coordinates. Using publicly available data from Elections Canada, the analysis shows strong evidence of position bias in all three elections. The data suggests that candidate stuffing has likely altered the vote share in each case and may have changed the outcome in one election. More broadly, the study concludes that all Canadian federal elections may be influenced by position bias to some degree, and that long ballots, which amplified this bias, may have revealed a democratic shortcoming that was previously harder to detect. The paper concludes that candidate stuffing poses a credible threat to electoral integrity and may represent a national security concern. The paper closes with several suggestions, shaped by public feedback."}}

The goal of this paper is to uncover hidden patterns among firms based on ESG scores, stock price volatility and financial indicators with the help of ML techniques. From the analysis, 3 distinguishable patterns were found among firms based on clustering; High ESG score firms in general had low volatility and a healthy financial standing. On the contrary, firms with low ESG score had high volatility and poor financial standing. Firms with mid-level ESG scores showed moderate volatility and financial standing. Anomaly detection results indicated the presence of anomalies among the 22 firms. Random Forest Regression was performed to compare prediction with actuals. Feature Importance concluded EBIT as the most important feature followed by CSR. The findings provide valuable insights on how ESG scores and financial indicators relate to stock price volatility which in turn influences investor decisions."}}

However, in contemporary governance, actors increasingly shape outcomes through subtle, preemptive behaviours that escape conventional models. Scope and Purpose: This paper introduces Anticipated Steps Initiation (ASI) as a foundational framework of behavioural foresight. ASI explains how political actors initiate influence before formal events through symbolic cues, layered timing and informal leverage. It seeks to provide scholars, policymakers and strategists with a more predictive lens for understanding and navigating strategic behaviour in both democratic and hybrid regimes. Methodology: The paper applies a conceptual approach, grounded in comparative theoretical review and real world case studies from Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The analysis is supported by the Overt-Covert Analysis model, which maps ASI behaviours across governance transparency and activation visibility. Analysis: ASI is built on seven behavioural mechanisms: initiation, symbolic encoding, temporal layering, narrative conditioning, informal leverage, instinctive futures and formal advantage. It defines three operational typologies: offensive, defensive and latent. Through illustrative cases, the paper shows how ASI actors shape institutional responses before rivals are even aware. Implications: ASI offers new diagnostic and planning tools for public sector agencies and think tanks. It also raises critical ethical questions regarding preemptive strategy in fragile democracies and transitional states. ASI thus marks the beginning of a broader discipline in behavioural foresight for governance."}}

However, in low-resource African settings, technological gaps, supply chain constraints, and structural inequalities lead to an endemic \"clinical invisibility,\" severely compromising diagnostic capacity. Despite these challenges, local healthcare practitioners are developing innovative, frugal solutions tailored to their specific contexts. Objective: This study explores the indigenous innovations emerging within African diagnostic radiology ecosystems, analyses persistent technological gaps, and proposes a contextual ethical framework addressing the visibility-invisibility dichotomy in clinical decision-making. Methods: A qualitative, multi-site exploratory study was conducted in three urban centers in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, and Kisangani. Data collection involved 30 semi-structured interviews with radiologists, 15 in-depth interviews with biomedical engineers, and non-participant observations in clinical settings. Data were thematically analyzed using NVivo software. \n<div>\n Results: Innovations identified included the creative use of mobile phones with AI-powered applications for point-of-care ultrasound, and locally fabricated radiological supports using recycled materials. However, technological gaps persisted, notably with a 70% failure rate in heavy diagnostic equipment (CT, MRI), compounded by unreliable maintenance infrastructures. These gaps produce an ethical crisis of clinical invisibility, forcing clinicians into decision-making under epistemic uncertainty.\n</div>\n<div>\n Conclusion: Endogenous innovations represent a form of \"resistance intelligence\" against structural diagnostic invisibility. However, sustainable progress requires a rethinking of technological sovereignty and the adoption of an \"Ethics of Visibility\" tailored to low-resource settings. This study proposes a novel conceptual framework to guide equitable diagnostic practices in Africa.&nbsp;\n</div>"}}

To resolve this enigma, we introduce and formalize a unified dynamical framework centered on the Principle of Cognitive Gravity. Our core thesis posits that the cognition of any intelligent entity operates within a \"cognitive spacetime\" whose geometry is warped by historical experience. Success accumulates Cognitive Mass (M c) within this space, and when this mass exceeds a critical threshold, it undergoes gravitational collapse, forming what we term a Cognitive Singularity (or \"cognitive black hole\")-a region that systematically distorts and captures conflicting paradigmatic information. Through systematic analysis of the cross-scale structural isomorphism between Einstein's resistance to quantum mechanics and Kodak's failure in the digital revolution, we provide compelling preliminary evidence for the principle's scale invariance. Crucially, the theory moves beyond explanation to prediction: it hypothesizes that the effects of cognitive gravity are diffuse and global, detectable at the neural level via seemingly unrelated priming tasks-a forecast that starkly contrasts with traditional cognitive models. Ultimately, this framework offers a novel \"cognitive physics\" perspective for understanding cognitive inertia and lays the scientific foundation for an emerging applied discipline, Cognitive Systems Engineering, by providing a testable prediction about the diffuse effects of gravity that fundamentally challenges existing paradigms."}}

Though Lagos had demonstrated a more organized regulatory framework, including licensing and usury rates, its implementation is problematic, with the operation of informal lenders still being visible. On the other hand, the less formalized framework in Akwa Ibom presents significant risks of borrowers being exploited by unregulated lenders. In this paper, the socioeconomic implications of such a regulatory difference with regard to borrower vulnerability, cycles of debt, and financial insecurity are analyzed using secondary data in a qualitative manner. The findings bring to the fore the need for a standardized yet adaptable federal framework that harmonizes regulations, promotes financial inclusion, and protects borrowers across Nigeria. Recommendations include strengthening enforcement capacities, smoothing the process of licensing, and implementing borrower education programs in order to have a more level and fair money lending environment."}}

They rely on structure. They rely on understanding the invisible laws that govern perception, influence, control, and strategic movement. The 36 Codes of Strategic Authority is a weaponized handbook for those who seek not just to survive leadership—but to master it with surgical precision. It is not a collection of motivational ideas. It is a systematic unveiling of timeless tactics engineered to build power, direct attention, craft influence, and protect reputation in the arenas where visibility, timing, and authority matter most. Leadership in today’s world is no longer just about what you know or even what you can do— it is about how you are perceived, positioned, and remembered. This book does not simply tell you to lead—it teaches you how power actually works, how to design influence, how to maneuver in silence, and how to exit with legacy. It is built for professionals, commanders, entrepreneurs, educators, executives, and strategists who understand that modern leadership is a game of deliberate architecture, not random charisma. Divided into six tightly structured parts, the book begins with the inner battlefield—because before you command others, you must first command yourself. From there, it expands into the tactical dimensions of perception, the architecture of influence, the mechanics of control, the art of reputational endurance, and finally, the ascent toward legacy and succession. Each code is written to be clear, sharp, and actionable, blending timeless principles with modern relevance. Inside these pages, readers will learn how to: • Build self-discipline that radiates outward authority • Engineer powerful first impressions and shape lasting perception • Influence outcomes through subtle social positioning • Control conversations and conflicts without ever raising a voice • Weaponize silence, scarcity, timing, and presence • Create symbolic value that extends beyond credentials • Design succession, legacy, and departure on your own terms These are not feel-good ideas or recycled management platitudes. These are strategic codes— battle-tested insights that teach you to command quietly, maneuver intelligently, and dominate ethically. This book is for those who are tired of vague advice and ready to see leadership as a form of discipline, design, and direction. It is for the reader who knows that success is not about luck— but about preparation, timing, and control of narrative. It is for those who refuse to be background players in their own story. If you want to lead movements, shape institutions, protect your reputation, or simply navigate power with more clarity and control—this book was written for you. The 36 Codes of Strategic Authority is not about pretending to be powerful. It is about becoming unignorable. Let the first code unlock your ascent. Let the last code prepare your legacy. Let them remember you—not just for what you built, but for how you built it. Welcome to the codes. Welcome to control."}}

In this chapter, we discuss how blockchain technology can be leveraged as a seminal infrastructure to reinforce the resilience of supply chains incorporating integrated cybersecurity approaches, digital twin deployment, and predictive maintenance policies. The paper is building upon current literature and trends to discuss the potential of blockchain's immutable ledger capabilities to develop resilient, digital twin-based supply chain ecosystems optimized for dealing with and rebounding from supply chain disruptions. The investigation presents the blockchain technology as an essential facilitator for real-time visibility, traceability, and trust among complex supply networks as well as for cybersecurity with decentralized authentication and cryptographic protections aspects. Integration of digital twins enhances these advantages by generating digital representations of physical supply chain assets and operations, to provide continuous observation and simultaneous simulation and optimization of processes. Predictive maintenance apps also improve resilience by using machine learning models and IoT sensor data to predict equipment breakdowns before they occur and streamline maintenance scheduling. The chapter further points to important opportunities for organizations to use these intersecting technologies for competitive advantage and discusses some potential barriers of success such as technology complexity, standards issues and organizational preparedness needs. The paper adds to the emerging work in supply chain digitalization and offers a practical perspective for managers interested in building operational resilience through adoption of emerging technologies."}}

This essay traces the twin's ascent, surveying national policies and global trends, then unpacks the five interwoven layers of the digital twin ecosystem. It argues that without the lens of complexity science, the digital twin becomes reductionist-amplifying false certainty. True value lies not in perfect simulation but in adaptive co-evolution, where human agency, judgment, and institutional memory remain indispensable.

To consolidate the state of the art in the field, this study review adopted a PRISMA methodology that catalogues the empirical and theoretical literature. The research finds that machine and deep learning, reinforcement learning, and ensemble algorithms, are increasingly used for predictive analytics, real-time risk monitoring, and autonomous decision-making in supply chain management. Key use cases are identified, such as demand prediction, supplier risk management, inventory optimization, and disruption prediction in complex manufacturing network. The study identifies significant progress in such technologies as digital twins, edge computing and human-centric AI systems, which all represent the move from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. The data quality and data interoperability problems, algorithmic transparency issues, and the requirements of robust cybersecurity framework are identified as the challenges ahead. Results reveal that AI driven supply chain resilience strategies can lower the operational risks by 45% and increase the reaction speed towards market volatilities by 60%. This chapter adds to the AI/ML literature by developing an organized taxonomy of how AI/ML is currently and prospectively being used to enhance supply chain resilience and by offering an illustrative application for manufacturing companies to become intelligent, sustainable, and human-focused supply chain ecosystems."}}

We estimate and compare the sequence of flows between nodes using gravity models (GM). However, in studying the global location advantages of a port, these sequences should be well connected, a case not treated in the literature. We combine a multi-echelon supply chain approach with well-combined sequential gravity mechanisms where the time distances, waiting time in the ports, and GDP of origin and destination play a central role. Our approach represents a novel approach to the intercontinental supply chain design and evaluation. In GM, the time distance variable is a proxy for transportation cost and enables us to jointly estimate transportation and waiting time influences. The time distance better measures impact of a pollutant on the environment of a supply chain than the geographic distance. With the time distances as a major factor in the GM formula, the GM is embedded in three consecutive sections of the intercontinental supply chain formulation and strongly connects them. The approach enables us to estimate the advantages of opening a new port in Cartagena, as the main port of Murcia, Spain. This investment would reduce the waiting lines of ships in other ports of the northern Mediterranean Sea and attract more containerized vessels to the area. Using sequential gravity mechanisms, we find that the Cartagena area in Murcia was appealing enough to begin investing in a new port, which could be among the top 100 international ports."}}

They rely on structure. They rely on understanding the invisible laws that govern perception, influence, control, and strategic movement. The 36 Codes of Strategic Authority is a weaponized handbook for those who seek not just to survive leadership—but to master it with surgical precision. It is not a collection of motivational ideas. It is a systematic unveiling of timeless tactics engineered to build power, direct attention, craft influence, and protect reputation in the arenas where visibility, timing, and authority matter most. Leadership in today’s world is no longer just about what you know or even what you can do— it is about how you are perceived, positioned, and remembered. This book does not simply tell you to lead—it teaches you how power actually works, how to design influence, how to maneuver in silence, and how to exit with legacy. It is built for professionals, commanders, entrepreneurs, educators, executives, and strategists who understand that modern leadership is a game of deliberate architecture, not random charisma. Divided into six tightly structured parts, the book begins with the inner battlefield—because before you command others, you must first command yourself. From there, it expands into the tactical dimensions of perception, the architecture of influence, the mechanics of control, the art of reputational endurance, and finally, the ascent toward legacy and succession. Each code is written to be clear, sharp, and actionable, blending timeless principles with modern relevance. Inside these pages, readers will learn how to: • Build self-discipline that radiates outward authority • Engineer powerful first impressions and shape lasting perception • Influence outcomes through subtle social positioning • Control conversations and conflicts without ever raising a voice • Weaponize silence, scarcity, timing, and presence • Create symbolic value that extends beyond credentials • Design succession, legacy, and departure on your own terms These are not feel-good ideas or recycled management platitudes. These are strategic codes— battle-tested insights that teach you to command quietly, maneuver intelligently, and dominate ethically. This book is for those who are tired of vague advice and ready to see leadership as a form of discipline, design, and direction. It is for the reader who knows that success is not about luck— but about preparation, timing, and control of narrative. It is for those who refuse to be background players in their own story. If you want to lead movements, shape institutions, protect your reputation, or simply navigate power with more clarity and control—this book was written for you. The 36 Codes of Strategic Authority is not about pretending to be powerful. It is about becoming unignorable. Let the first code unlock your ascent. Let the last code prepare your legacy. Let them remember you—not just for what you built, but for how you built it. Welcome to the codes. Welcome to control."}}

The study examines how such nascent digital technologies, a cornerstone of Industry 4.0 and the emergent Industry 5.0 notions, enable agile and responsive supply chain ecosystems that can adapt to and recover from such uncertainties. The integration of smart manufacturing and advanced digital technologies for operational efficiency and inventory management optimization: A literature review using the PRISMA method Results show that IoT enabled sensors and devices produce massive amounts of real-time data, and when integrated with advanced Big Data analytics platforms, offer deep insights and predictive power for supply chain networks. Automated technologies can also extend these abilities by engaging in decision making and other responses that can react nimbly to changing situations. The study shows that firms utilising these integrated technological solutions are able to enhance supply chain agility, risk reduction and overall resilience. But there are struggles ahead, such as cyber security worries and the difficulty of integration, as well as the cost of major infrastructure spending. The chapter adds to the current literature by developing an integrated structure for understanding the interrelated impact of these technologies on supply chain resilience which includes operationalization of these concepts within the framework, and practical implications for organizations wishing to transform their supply chain in an environment characterized by enhanced digitalization and connectivity."}}

Based on a systematic literature review using the PRISMA methodology, this study reviews state-of-the-art application cases, approaches, frameworks, and future trends of sustainable SCM. It was found that the implementation of a circular economy in supply chains substantially decreases the environmental impacts via waste minimization, optimal resource use efficiency and circular material flows. Key results show that companies practicing circular supply chain models are more resilient to disturbances, increase in resource security and can achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Findings reveal key success factors: stakeholder collaboration, technological innovation, alignment with regulation and evaluation systems. But challenges remain in terms of capital demands when it comes to the initial investment cost, the complexity of the coordination systems, and the standardization of circular metrics. It also advances the body of knowledge by bridging circular economy principles and supply chain resilience in an integrated manner, offering practical implications for the stakeholders. Possible future research directions are advanced analytics for circular supply chain optimization, adoption of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence in traceability and efficiency, and cross-industry collaboration models for scale of the circular economy."}}

Although prevailing logistics and supply chain studies advocate other long-term risk reduction strategies such as China-plus-one, setting up alternative local suppliers, etc, this study contributes a totally different perspective on the risk mitigation strategy using a financial approach with step-by-step guidance provided. This study explores the direct hedging and cross-hedging instruments and apply the financial hedging strategies that can be used to mitigate the risk of seaborne rate volatility based on the Shanghai Containerized Export Freight Index (SCFI). This study employs the simple ordinary least squares (OLS), vector autoregressive (VAR), vector error correction (VEC), and maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) models to evaluate the direct hedging and cross-hedging effectiveness of the futures contracts with different underlying assets, such as various commodities and stock indices. Among all estimated hedge ratios, multiscale hedge ratios perform the best, simple OLS perform moderately, while static hedge ratios estimated by VAR and VEC models underperform. Surprisingly, the direct hedge is not always the most effective hedging instrument for the risk of sea freight rate over the medium to longer-term period, but it remains the most effective hedge over the short-term period. In addition, steel futures and European stock index futures outperform other crosshedges and even the SCFIS (Europe) futures contract in some cases."}}

As a secondary contribution, we extend Cotton [2024] Schur Complementary Allocation framework by introducing three distinct Schur portfolio variants with enhanced theoretical foundations. Using a diversified portfolio of 15 major US stocks from 2010 to 2024, our empirical analysis demonstrates that RA-HRP achieves exceptional performance with a Sharpe ratio of 1.336, representing a statistically significant 5.31% annual excess return over traditional HRP. This breakthrough stems from RA-HRP's ability to systematically allocate toward high-Sharpe ratio assets while maintaining robust diversification through hierarchical clustering. Our Schur portfolio extensions demonstrate competitive performance, with the Risk-Adjusted variant achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.049. The theoretical framework provides precise predictions about optimal deployment conditions, and our comprehensive empirical validation strongly confirms these predictions. This work establishes RA-HRP as a superior alternative to traditional HRP and contributes valuable extensions to spectral portfolio construction methods."}}

The framework combines human-in-the-loop oversight, constraint translation through Anthropic's Claude AI, and controlled implementation using OpenAI's ChatGPT-4. Applied to five years of multi-asset data (300 weekly observations across 29 instruments), the system prevented fabricated Sharpe ratios and eliminated unsubstantiated \"get-rich-quick\" strategies while preserving analytical innovation. Average Sharpe Ratios declined from 1.13 in unconstrained testing to 0.047 after transaction cost adjustments, providing honest failure reporting and realistic performance attribution. Unlike post-hoc detection methods, our approach embeds domain-specific financial safeguards directly in the strategy generation process. The framework consistently blocked Sharpe &gt;1.5 claims across 15 pressure-testing iterations, ensuring transparency, auditability, and regulatory alignment with emerging standards (e.g., SEC predictive analytics rules, IEEE 7000-2021, MiFID II). This methodology enables hedge funds, asset managers, and fintech platforms to enhance compliance readiness, reduce model risk, and build investor trust while optimizing AI-driven productivity."}}

Applying counterfactual estimators to assess the impact of these decisions on OR utilization, we identify some key trade-offs. Specifically, we find that ad hoc reallocations reduce the over-utilization but increase the under-utilization in ORs from which surgeries are reallocated (i.e., the initial ORs). Moreover, the ORs receiving the reallocated surgeries (i.e., the recipient ORs) experience a reduction in under-utilization but a rise in over-utilization. Our mechanism analyses further demonstrate that the multifaceted impact of reallocations is contingent upon several factors (i.e., the number of originally scheduled surgeries and the presence of surgical and anesthesia assistants), a result that highlights the complexities in ad hoc surgery reallocation decisions. Managerial Implications: Our study is the first to provide a holistic examination of the impact of ad hoc surgery reallocation decisions. Practitioners should be mindful of the trade-offs in ad hoc surgery reallocation decisions when adopting this strategy to improve OR utilization and, by factoring in key contextual elements such as surgical volume and available support staff, make more informed decisions to balance resource utilization across ORs and minimize inefficiencies."}}

The framework is structured in three levels: a Foundational Economic Footprint of direct human presence, a Structural Core of contextual modifiers from the developed and natural landscape, and an Apex for application-specific syntheses. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through an empirical application in Nepal, a severely data-scarce environment. Using 14 proxies organized according to the Pyramid, we confront a P ≫ N scenario (14 predictors, 7 provincial observations) by employing a PCA-enhanced Elastic Net (ENPCR) model.

The model's scores are used in a mass-preserving dasymetric process to produce a validated 500-meter GDP map. This work makes a dual contribution: it delivers a valuable public data product for Nepal, and more broadly, it offers a transferable methodology for principled, high-resolution economic mapping in other data-scarce regions. We conclude by showing how the Pyramid framework can be extended beyond pure economic estimation to serve as a foundational layer for holistic Socio-Ecological System (SES) diagnostics."}}

Traditional bundling theory, which usually assumes abundant inventory and static pricing settings, typically asserts that bundling generates higher revenue than selling products individually. However, we show that limited inventory, in fact, distorts the revenue extraction capability of bundling in favor of selling the products or services separately. We study the optimal dynamic mixed bundling strategy in a large market regime where the market size grows relative to limited inventory. Leveraging this framework, we derive optimal dynamic pricing policies and value functions for commonly used bundling strategies, including mixed bundling, pure bundling, bundle-size pricing, and component pricing. Our analysis reveals that as inventory becomes more constrained relative to market size, the most general dynamic mixed bundling strategy converges to a dynamic component pricing strategy, outperforming both dynamic bundle-size pricing and dynamic pure bundling. Moreover, the performance gap between these strategies increases with the number of items, a factor typically viewed as favoring bundling when inventory is abundant. Notably, our numerical experiments suggest that these insights also extend to the fluid-regime policies, revealing that as the market size increases relative to inventory, the dynamic mixed bundling strategy derived from the fluid regime mimics a dynamic component pricing strategy."}}

The tariffs threaten to impact key sectors of the Indian economy, including textiles, pharmaceuticals, and auto components, and potentially slow GDP growth. The paper examines a multi-pronged response being considered by New Delhi. This strategy includes: a diplomatic push for a bilateral trade agreement; an economic recalibration focused on trade diversification through new Free Trade Agreements (FTAs); strengthening domestic manufacturing via the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' initiative; considering retaliatory tariffs as a negotiating tool; and pursuing legal recourse at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

An heir CEO is the individual who inherits the position of CEO from the founder of the firm.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed capping credit card late fees at eight dollars for large issuers; however, this rule was vacated by federal courts in 2024, creating ongoing ambiguity for lenders. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes increased borrowing costs nationwide. This study analyzes aggregated portfolio data from a major publicly traded fintech company's private-label and co-branded credit card portfolios, encompassing billions of dollars in loans, to evaluate the combined effects of these factors on borrower credit risk, approval rates, delinquency, and lender capital requirements. Employing logistic regression, survival analysis, machine learning techniques, and scenario-based stress testing, the research finds that regulatory uncertainty around late fee caps correlates with improved repayment behavior but reduces fee income. Rising interest rates increase delinquency risk, partially mitigated by promotional financing products such as buy now pay later (BNPL) plans. A hybrid credit risk model incorporating regulatory and macroeconomic factors improves risk prediction and capital allocation. The findings offer actionable insights for credit risk managers, lenders, and policymakers aiming to balance consumer protection with financial stability."}}

Design/methodology/approach: Primary data were collected from 721 train drivers working in the South Central zone of Indian railways. The data collection tool was a questionnaire that is distributed online to the participants. Hierarchical regression analysis and mediation analysis using PROCESS Model 4 were employed to test the hypotheses. Main findings: Supervisor support had a significant positive effect on quality of work life, work family conflict had a significant negative effect on QWL, supervisor support showed a significant negative effect on work family conflict and work family conflict was found to be partially mediating the effect of supervisor support on QWL. Practical implications: The current research reported that a supportive supervisor can enhance employees' QWL directly, as well as indirectly by reducing conflicts at work and family interface. This finding suggests that organizations aiming to promote employees' QWL should invest in training programs that cultivate supportive behaviors among supervisors and also equip them with the resources needed to help employees manage the competing demands of work and family roles. Originality/value: By investigating the mediating role of work family conflict, this research uncovered the underlying mechanism through which supervisor support influences quality of work life, thereby contributing to the existing literature on QWL."}}

Using a sample of 5135 firms across 25 countries during the period 2002-2021, our interaction model run with panel regression showed that the association between BGD and CSR performance is positively (negatively) moderated by harmony (mastery) orientation. Moreover, our test of a three-way interaction among BGD, harmony (mastery), and cultural tightness-looseness on CSR performance revealed that the moderating effect of harmony (mastery) orientation is amplified when cultural tightness increases. The findings suggest that harmony/mastery orientation matters more for the effects of BGD on firm CSR performance under tight cultural conditions.

Kok et al. (2008)). However, once products are chosen, their emergent sales profiles—defined by popularity, average sales, and variability—can significantly influence expiration waste (EW), especially due to safety stock considerations and managerial oversight. EW is further exacerbated when these emergent sales profiles are adverse to embedded supply-side rigidities, particularly the common fixed case size constraint, which limits a retailer’s ability to adjust ordering in response to adverse emergent sales profiles. We provide large-scale empirical evidence on how such assortment-related externalities drive expiration waste.\n</div>\n<div>\n Methodology/Results: In collaboration with a grocery retailer, we construct a multi-store, multi-category dataset at the product×store×day level (∼21 million observations). Using variation in sales profiles and assortment choices over time and stores, we identify three key findings: (i) most products show considerable variability in their emergent sales profiles; (ii) sales attributes significantly and often non-linearly impact EW; and (iii) assortment primitives—specifically size and variety in life and price—meaningfully shape these profiles, indirectly affecting EW.\n</div>\n<div>\n Notably, a normalized measure of case size emerges as a major determinant, explaining over 10% of EW variation. Instances in the top quartile of normalized case size exhibit an EW-to-sales ratio 7–10 percentage points higher than those in the bottom quartile—a large relative impact. Assortment primitives significantly shape this case size measure.\n</div>\n<div>\n <span>Managerial Implications</span><span>: Our findings highlight a substantial and economically meaningful negative externality of assortment decisions on expiration waste.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a conceptual study that employs a multiple-case study approach to illustrate its theoretical framework. It primarily uses publicly available third-party investigation reports (e.g., Mitsubishi Electric, Iwaki Shinkin Bank) as its data source. A dual framework, comprising the \"Triangle of Commission\" for intentional misconduct and the \"Triangle of Omission\" for the organizational culture that incubates it, is applied for analysis. Findings: The analysis reveals that a common organizational pathology exists across industries. In the Mitsubishi Electric case, \"justification that no practical quality issues exist\" and \"vulnerability of the quality assurance department\" were typical examples constituting the Triangle of Commission, while \"disconnect between headquarters and front lines\" and \"dysfunction of middle management\" formed the Triangle of Omission. The concurrent operation of these triangles was found to maintain and reproduce the decoupling of internal controls. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in presenting a theoretical framework that simultaneously analyzes organizational misconduct through two distinct yet interrelated triangle models: \"commission\" and \"omission.\" This enables a consistent explanation of not only isolated acts of misconduct but also the underlying organizational culture and structural issues, leading to the proposal of more fundamental prescriptions."}}

As the banking industry becomes increasingly competitive, service quality has appeared as a key factor that influence customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention. This study aims at assessing the service quality of PCBs in Bangladesh's retail banking sector, using the SERVQUAL model as a framework. The research evaluates five core dimensions of service quality like tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire distributed to 400 retail banking customers in Dhaka, covering major private commercial banks such as, Prime Bank Ltd., BRAC Bank Ltd., Eastern Bank Ltd., and Dutch-Bangla Bank Ltd. The study analyzes customer perceptions and expectations to identify service quality gaps and their implications on the overall satisfaction of the customers. Findings indicate that the reliability-the ability of banks to provide accurate and dependable services-is the most critical determinant of perceived service quality. Customers also value assurance, reflected in the competence and professionalism of bank employees. Tangibles, including modern facilities and digital services, were generally well-received by the customers. However, the study highlights shortcomings in responsiveness and empathy. Customers reported dissatisfaction with long wait times, delayed responses to inquiries, and a lack of personalized service. These gaps suggest a need for banks to improve employee training, invest in Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and enhance service delivery across both physical and digital platforms. The study identified that the private commercial banks in Bangladesh have made advances in improving the service quality. It suggests that the efforts are needed to create a more responsive and customercentric retail banking experience in Bangladesh. Addressing these service gaps will be crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and sustaining competitive advantage in the growing financial sector of Bangladesh."}}

We propose two optimization frameworks, each tailored to a distinct practical setting: one with predictable short-term demand and easy recruitment, and another with uncertain demand and challenging recruitment of specialized healthcare workers. Using a Markov decision process, we show that the optimal recruitment policy for permanent staff follows a hire-up-to structure in both frameworks, which reduces the search space and accelerates calculations. We numerically and analytically examine how various model parameters influence the hire-up-to value for the two frameworks. Applying the first framework, we further characterize the conditions that trigger temporary recruitment and also show that mandatory caps on temporary wages are not cost-effective. Finally, using the second framework, we assess the savings obtained from our dynamic policy compared to a myopic policy which decides based on the cost of a single-interval planning horizon, and identify scenarios where a long-term blended workforce model adds value to the system."}}

Our central research question addresses the role of executive characteristics in technology adoption, finding that CEO age and technical background significantly predict AI investment propensity. Employing these demographic characteristics as instrumental variables to address endogeneity concerns, we identify a statistically significant 2.4% increase in total factor productivity attributable to AI investment adoption. Our novel mechanism decomposition framework reveals that productivity gains operate through three distinct channels: cost reduction (40% of total effect), revenue enhancement (35%), and innovation acceleration (25%). The results demonstrate that younger executives (below 50 years) are 23% more likely to adopt AI technologies, while firm size significantly moderates this relationship. Aggregate projections 1 suggest potential GDP impacts of ¥1.15 trillion from widespread AI adoption across the Japanese economy. These findings provide crucial empirical guidance for understanding the human factors driving digital transformation and inform both corporate governance and public policy regarding AI investment incentives."}}

Drawing from both societal and technological perspectives, the research examines the impact of historical challenges, including systemic discrimination during the Civil Rights era and the aftermath of mission failures such as the Challenger explosion. It highlights the resilience of NASA engineers, astronauts, and scientists (especially underrepresented contributors such as African American women mathematicians), and connects their perseverance to key milestones in NASA’s development. Technological innovations, including the COLDArm and the International Space Station, are examined to demonstrate how adaptive thinking and planning contribute to mission success. Through a multidisciplinary lens, this paper argues that NASA’s accomplishments are not the product of chance but of a deep-rooted culture of persistence, innovation, and courage in the face of adversity. The findings underscore the importance of human resolve in advancing the frontiers of space exploration."}}

The analysis focused on dimensions such as tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, offering a comprehensive understanding of service delivery gaps. Findings reveal widespread dissatisfaction among passengers, with 91.9% expressing negative sentiments toward GAFS. Specifically, 11.76% of respondents reported being fully dissatisfied, and 80.14% were fairly dissatisfied. Only 6.62% of respondents indicated some level of satisfaction, while 0.74% felt neutral or fully satisfied. The results point to systemic deficiencies in service delivery, including poor infrastructure, inadequate customer engagement, and operational inefficiencies. Tangibility, encompassing physical infrastructure and facilities, emerged as a significant area of concern, highlighting the urgent need for modernization. The high level of dissatisfaction emphasizes the importance of targeted interventions to improve service quality at Ibadan Airport. Recommended strategies include upgrading infrastructure, implementing regular staff training, and integrating modern technologies to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience. Addressing these gaps is essential not only for meeting passenger expectations but also for positioning Ibadan Airport as a competitive regional hub within Nigeria's aviation industry."}}

The article then focuses on estimating the historical measure model via maximum likelihood. It is then demonstrated that the considered PDV model outperforms existing models in the literature based on likelihood metrics. The paper subsequently evaluates the consistency between the probability measure implied by the model estimated under P and the option market data. The obtained results reveal that these measures are fairly close, which both validates the model's consistency with market data and supports the hypothesis of high endogeneity the P-and Q-dynamics, along with their tight interconnection. In light of this relationship, we propose a new model estimation approach combining P-and Q-information in order to enhance calibration robustness. The approach's effectiveness is then benchmarked against classical calibration methods."}}

Leadership is a very important subject of discourse in our societies. The reason for this is that there is a necessary and undeniable nexus between the quality of leadership and the developmental strides of a society. Although the problem of leadership is a universal one, this problem is very common in Nigeria, especially with the kinds of political leadership she has had post-independence. The questions then are: who is a good leader? What makes one a leader? Are leaders born or are they made? These and many others are the topical questions that are viewed from the perspective of Udofia. Udofia believes that a careful assessment of the ‘Golden Triad on Leadership’ can help in ramifying leadership challenges by positing the categorical fundamental criterion for becoming a leader. In this paper, we expose Udofia’s leadership philosophy, analyze it, and examine his logic of virtue-leadership correspondence which he extrapolates from the philosophical posits of the golden age philosophers, where the possession of virtue is seen as a <i>conditio sine qua non </i>for leaders. Finally, we situate Udofia’s leadership philosophy in the Nigerian space and examine its relevance to the leadership problems we have postindependence. The paper concludes that for Nigeria to prosper, her leaders need to be both morally and effectively competent.</p>"}}

These clusters were then incorporated into a shortlist generation algorithm to ensure diversity in scheduling candidates, and subsequently evaluated through a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model. Comparative analyses across three years demonstrated that the proposed method better aligns with the distribution of patient types in the main waiting list, yielding lower deviation and higher marginal accuracy than traditional scheduling practices. The findings suggest that integrating unsupervised ML into OR planning not only reduces reliance on subjective judgments but also improves the diversity-balance level and equity of surgical scheduling."}}

Results from our first experiment reveal key deviations from rational models: production-linked price premium incentives that are nearly optimal under the rational model do not outperform simple fixed payments due to behavioral factors, including bounded rationality, cost aversion, and pro-environmental preference. To address this, we develop a behavioral incentive design framework, refining incentive structures and experimental design to account for these observed behavioral factors. In the redesigned second experiment, behaviorally-calibrated price premium incentive significantly increased consistent adoption of sustainable practices as compared to fixed payments, at no extra cost. Our findings highlight the need for empirically grounded, behaviorally informed incentive design to practically enhance sustainability in supply chains and offer actionable insights to policymakers and practitioners."}}

Given the complexity, precision requirements, and stringent regulatory standards involved in producing devices such as MRI, CT, and ultrasound systems, effective maintenance is vital to ensuring consistent equipment performance, regulatory compliance, and product quality. Despite the proven benefits of Lean and Six Sigma in various industrial and healthcare sectors, their targeted application within the context of imaging equipment maintenance remains underexplored. To address this gap, the study conducted a systematic review of 42 peerreviewed articles, selected and analyzed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The findings demonstrate that Lean tools like 5S, Value Stream Mapping, and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), when combined with Six Sigma techniques such as DMAIC, FMEA, and control charts, significantly enhance equipment uptime, reduce maintenance variability, and improve metrics such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). Furthermore, the study finds that these methodologies promote better documentation, risk-based maintenance planning, and stronger alignment with regulatory frameworks such as ISO 13485 and FDA 21 CFR Part 820. Enhanced cross-functional collaboration and operator engagement were also identified as key enablers of sustained improvement. However, the review also reveals challenges, including variability in implementation outcomes, a lack of sector-specific LSS models, and insufficient empirical benchmarking. As a result, the study recommends the development of customized Lean Six Sigma frameworks tailored to the specific demands of imaging equipment manufacturing. These frameworks should integrate digital maintenance intelligence, compliance-focused documentation, and cross-functional ownership to achieve long-term reliability and regulatory excellence. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of how Lean and Six Sigma can support high-performance, compliant, and efficient maintenance in medical imaging manufacturing."}}

Building on Jullien's work on Taoist approaches to effective action and Bovens's definition of hope, we define starting from hopelessness as (a) desiring an outcome, (b) believing it is possible, though uncertain, and, instead of imagining things otherwise, (c) accepting the grim situation one is in, harvesting what potential it offers without pre-set plans. The principles of acceptance, humility and togetherness help guide hopeless action. We illustrate divergent crisis responses, starting from goals or from hopelessness, through cases in Orissa and Wayanad, India. We further explore what 'hopeless planning' and 'hopeless research and innovation' may involve."}}

This study presents a large-scale systematic review of 1,756 scholarly publications, offering a structured and quantitative synthesis of methodological approaches used for readmission estimation. Using a novel method–condition matrix, we map analytical techniques to their associated clinical conditions or interventions and categorize them into five groups: traditional statistical models, machine learning (ML) approaches, neural networks and deep learning, survival and time-to-event models, and emerging or less commonly used techniques.Traditional methods—particularly multivariate logistic regression—remain dominant across most clinical contexts, including cardiovascular, surgical, and musculoskeletal applications. However, ML methods such as Random Forest, boosting algorithms, and Support Vector Machines are gaining prominence in high-dimensional or multi-condition datasets, supporting more adaptive and scalable prediction frameworks. Deep learning approaches, while limited in number, are emerging in data-rich environments such as EHRs and unstructured clinical records. Survival models, especially Cox regression, are widely used in oncology and multi-condition applications.

Using a hand-collected dataset, we find that large European banks reduce their foreign income ratio when domestic EPU increases. We also find evidence that this inverse relationship is driven by banks' home bias, the flight-to-home effect, the follow-the-customer strategy, and product diversification. Banking regulation is another key factor contributing to the reduction of banks' foreign income. Foreign income also declines during periods of high financial stress and stock price volatility, which signals an environment of uncertainty. These findings provide critical insights for regulators and financial institutions on the importance of macroeconomic stability and effective regulation in maintaining robust international banking operations."}}

To boost contributions, third parties often donate large sums that fundraisers use to incentivize individual donations, with one-to-one matching being the most common mechanism. However, alternative designs may lead to even higher contributions. This paper investigates the effectiveness of two design choices in the context of fundraising: (i) the incentive mechanism, focusing on the two most prevalent ones (i.e., matching and gift unlock); and (ii) the solicitation mechanism, i.e., whether donations occur simultaneously or sequentially.&nbsp; \n<div>\n <b>Methodology/Results: </b>We introduce a stylized game-theoretical model where a fundraiser decides the design choices and corresponding design parameters to maximize overall donations. Following the fundraiser's decision, donors, endowed with a certain amount of wealth, make their one-time contribution to the fundraiser. For each design choice, we characterize the equilibrium donations and find the fundraiser's optimal policy. We then compare the overall contribution for all combinations of design choices and find that gift unlock consistently outperforms matching. Moreover, sequential solicitation is the optimal choice with gift unlock, whereas simultaneous solicitation yields higher overall contributions with matching. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that the effectiveness of gift unlock is robust to peer effects and donor participation uncertainty, although high uncertainty shifts the optimal solicitation from sequential to simultaneous.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <b>Managerial implications:</b> Our findings indicate that fundraisers should prioritize gift unlock over matching, align the selected incentive mechanism with the optimal solicitation format, and calibrate campaign parameters to maximize donation outcomes.

The evolution of identity politics hiding behind tribalism, create the appetite for the young people to form their political parties in different regions. It is the battle of Goliath and David in different Southern African states, where the Goliath (Big men) are good at politicising everything in different institutions and David (the youth) so keen to promote good governance. It considers the demographic economic and drivers of politics in African states and their 2 consequences for promoting effective development. In African politics the big men call the shots, the youth are expected to listen and follow the guides to implement the policies at all costs. This has led to the uneven development in different communities, before using the legislation emerged alongside governance. Turning to the forms of African politics that have shaped economic developments mapping the \"state of the discipline\" of the youth to historically and geographically contextualise governance. This has been carving a route through a wide range of existing literatures relevant to the politics and governance in managing the economy of African states. The different literatures identify key gaps in African politics and indicate potential directions for governing of the African states. The findings for this paper are diverse governance structures, arbitrary borders, the struggle for independence and ineffective regional integration. As a result, the findings are closely linked the identification recommendations, which provide guides to change African states systems of governing."}}

The purpose of this study is to explore quality of Public Administration in Southern African states: A spectrum of failure or success. The challenges of quality of Public Administration requires targeted reforms, investment in human resources, and a commitment to transparency and accountability to enhance governance and service delivery in the Southern African region. Adaptation of the quality of Public Administration impacts the Southern Africa states which is a key pillar of change governance, and local governments have historically played a major role in the implementation of these policies. An array of political, economic, institutional, social and individual factors influences in using the adaptation policy instrument to government institutions. The quality of Public Administration is governed by policy instrument choice pursuing diverse adaptation policy implementation styles that are associated with different levels of internal capacity, local political economies. At the local government level, the Southern African states reflect ineffective intergovernmental dynamics that constrain or support local efforts in governing the institutions. The qualitative method is used to collect the data from articles, and textbooks to understand the quality of Public Administration in Southern Africa. The findings include the colonial legacy, centralised administration, political instability, weak democratic institutions and postcolonial governance in Southern African states.

We model these systems and develop algorithms to minimize the expected total cost of a project under task time and cost uncertainty. This enables us to make structural comparisons between the optimal expediting decisions and expected costs of the two systems. This in turn reveals that the time profile of project workload is an important factor in the relative costs of the two systems. An extensive computational study validates these theoretical results, and shows that the expected loss from choosing the wrong monitoring and control system is typically significant.

The rhetoric approach uses different methods, but five methods of rhetorical criticism which are cluster criticism, metaphor criticism, ideological criticism, narrative criticism, and pentadic criticism. The aim of this study is to explore the rhetoric approach in policy implementation in Southern Africa. For the following argument, the rhetoric approach has norms and values shared by different public officials implementing policies to encourage public participation. This provide narratives that are critical to policy implementation such as an interpretative approach to other social structures. The rhetoric approach has cultural issues which undermine building trust in managing a 2 central place in providing analysis of policy implementation. This article add value to managing rhetorics to policy implementation in Southern Africa closely linked to culture and the set of fundamental beliefs held by individuals. The rhetoric approach is valuable, shows what is fair, what constitutes right and wrong, who deserves what, and using the similar ethical matters, of policy implementation in Southern Africa. As with culture, the rhetoric approach is not necessarily, it may manifest in different institutions, implementing the policies in Southern African states. The overall aims of rhetoric approach are shared by different role players, working towards effectively implementing the policies in Southern Africa. Such goals do not need to be, and often aren't, written down or otherwise expressed in a way that political actors would explicitly use to implement policies. The qualitative data is used to collect data, from the previous literature published by the different scholars but can be deduced from the way they interact, with the norms and values for the organization. Because of the different rhetoric's, policy implementation is carefully collected by the different scholars, when analysing data from different states. The presentation is linked to the identification of findings which constitutes to the identification of recommendations which is admirable in this paper to follows the practice in some other literature of not separating them, to answer the objectives."}}

It proposes a practical model to transform conventional internal audits, which often remain static compliance checks, into a dynamic and self-learning process through the synergistic effects of AI and human auditors. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a conceptual study that builds a new operational model upon the author's preceding body of research. It proposes a clear division of roles between AI (responsible for \"Conformity/Compliance\" audits) and humans (responsible for \"Effectiveness\" audits), a \"human-in-theloop\" data cycle that promotes AI learning, and a collaborative reporting workflow. A key feature of this model is its adaptability to diverse management philosophies (TM), its ability to provide immediate AI-driven solutions to onsite challenges, and its inherent mechanism for fostering auditor competency development. Findings: The proposed framework creates a virtuous cycle where real-time quantitative data monitoring by AI is reinforced by qualitative, contextual insights obtained through dialogue by human auditors. Simultaneously, the model addresses the potential bottleneck of auditor skill sets by monitoring the audit process itself, thereby identifying and enabling targeted competency development. This allows both the audit function and human resources to evolve continuously. Originality/value: Whereas prior research established the theoretical foundation, this paper provides the indispensable \"how-to\" methodology for its implementation, along with a prescription for the associated human resource challenges. It proposes a sustainable, next-generation governance model by integrating advanced management theory, the specific operations of internal auditing, and human resource development into a single framework."}}

This paper applies the Dynamic Prescriptive Economics (DPE) framework to analyze and improve CBDC governance, using China's e-CNY (Digital Yuan) and the European Central Bank's Digital Euro as comparative case studies. DPE's quadrant-based model and Normalized Balanced Coordinates (NBCs) allow us to map each CBDC's governance decisions onto a two-dimensional normative space, making visible the hidden trade-offs and \"revelation of truth\" in their design choices. The e-CNY is found to prioritize state control and financial sovereignty at the expense of user privacy, placing it in an imbalanced quadrant. In contrast, the Digital Euro emphasizes privacy and financial stability, aiming for a more balanced outcome, though still constrained by conservative design choices. By diagnosing these imbalances, we identify governance blind spots-such as surveillance risks in the e-CNY and adoption hurdles in the Digital Euro-that traditional analyses often overlook. We then prescribe Dynamic Transition Strategies (STOs)-Substitutions, Transformations, and Offsets-to move each project toward the ideal Quadrant I of regenerative synergy. Visual tools, including quadrant diagrams and tables of normalized scores, illustrate how DPE quantitatively benchmarks each CBDC's proximity to an ideal balance and guides policy adjustments. The paper concludes with actionable recommendations for central banks, advocating the integration of DPE's structured approach into CBDC design to achieve sustainable, trustworthy, and inclusive digital currency systems."}}

In response, this paper introduces Quantum PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act), a novel conceptual framework that reframes quality improvement as a dynamic, context-sensitive, and ethically grounded practice. Drawing on metaphors from quantum mechanics-superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty-the model challenges the linear, deterministic logic of traditional PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) and proposes a paradigm shift from rigid routines to a continuous state of quality mindfulness. Central to this framework is the Confucian ethical principle of shèn dú (慎独)-\"vigilance in solitude\"-which anchors quality in personal integrity and moral awareness, even in the absence of external oversight. By integrating systems thinking, reflective practice, and humanistic philosophy, Quantum PDSA calls for a return to humility, presence, and continuous consciousness in organizational and educational settings. This paper does not offer a toolkit, but an invitation: to reclaim quality not as a cycle to complete, but as a state of being to inhabit."}}

The study analyzed the symbolic elements and artistic styles used in different graffiti works. The researchers included six (6) pieces of graffiti found in school surfaces that featured meaningful phrases, creative elements, and artistic expression. The graffiti analyzed in this study revealed themes such as personal struggles and ambitions to socio-political issues. The study discovered that graffiti is a multi-dimensional expression, revealing personal thought, social criticism, and cultural representation. These findings highlight the reality of university life, shedding light on the challenges, aspirations, and creative tendencies of students. Furthermore, understanding the implication of graffiti as a medium of expression is educationally significant, as it offers insights into the social and cultural dynamics within academic institutions. Educators and administrators can use this understanding to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment that values student perspectives. The study enhances the understanding of how graffiti conveys a wide range of messages and meanings to illustrate the role that art plays in constructing urban environments and reflecting societal values."}}

Unlike traditional estimate-then-optimize approaches, we propose an end-to-end satisficing model that directly integrates historical data and shape constraints to avoid overly conservative choices of demand function and achieve robust profitability against demand estimation error. To address the original nonlinear model with infinitely many constraints, we reformulate the problem into a bilevel optimization model. We derive tractable solutions via second-order cone programs for lower-level subproblems and design efficient algorithms under continuous and discrete pricing sets for the upper-level problem, respectively. Through theoretical and numerical validation, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of shape constraints depends critically on the decision-maker's profit targets. Notably, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: complex shape structures do not universally guarantee superior performance, whereas simplified structures prove more advantageous in low-profit-target scenarios. Furthermore, our results demonstrate non-asymptotic convergence to sample size across diverse noise distributions, demand structures, and shape features. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to confirm that the end-to-end model consistently outperforms parametric and non-parametric estimate-then-optimize methods across key profit metrics, including mean and VaR. This dual theoretical-empirical validation confirms the favorable balance of our framework between profitability and risk mitigation while maintaining robust performance."}}

To analyze the data and test the proposed hypotheses, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied. The findings reveal that sustainable practices are positively associated with SME competitiveness. Moreover, the analysis demonstrates that government incentives exert a strong and significant positive impact on SME competitiveness and serve as a positive moderator in the relationship between sustainable practices and competitiveness. The study addresses a notable gap in the literature, as few prior investigations have specifically examined the moderating role of government incentives in this context. By highlighting this dynamic, the research contributes valuable insights into how sustainable practices and supportive government policies together can enhance the competitiveness of SMEs operating in emerging economies."}}

First, I open the black box of manager-auditor negotiations to examine how financial statements are endogenously shaped through strategic interaction under information asymmetry. Second, I investigate how this negotiation process affects financial reporting quality. I develop a two-round negotiation game in which the manager, possessing private information about earnings, makes an initial offer and a potential counteroffer. The auditor, facing potential overstatement penalties, responds strategically while retaining the option to extend the audit-a costly activity for both parties. This framework allows auditor conservatism and managerial conservatism to emerge endogenously. I show that the manager-auditor negotiation leads to conditional overstatement or understatement and produces a non-monotonic, asymmetric pattern in financial reporting quality. Additionally, the model predicts a discontinuity in the distribution of reported earnings. These results offer new theoretical insights into the micro-foundations of auditing and yield testable implications for empirical research on financial reporting quality and earnings distribution."}}

Drawing on a mixed-methods approach, by examines three core sectors of the gig economy: ride-hailing, food delivery, and digital freelancing. Through original survey data combined with secondary platform reports and user-generated content from online forums, the Earnings Elasticity Index (EEI) was developed to quantify the responsiveness of gig workers' income to changes in labor input and platform dynamics, and assess income volatility using standard deviation. Riders such as Uber or Grab have high earnings elasticity, where small changes in supply or demand result in significant fluctuations in income. However, delivery works show normal elasticity, heavily shaped by algorithmic factors. Digital freelancing, while less elastic in hourly rates, suffers from unfixed income and high project-based volatility. Across all sectors, higher elasticity correlates with reduced financial security, limited saving capacity, and increased dependence on credit. These insights have important implications for labor policy and platform governance. This study contributes to labor economics by introducing a comparative, elasticity-based lens to assess gig work sustainability, emphasizing the need for interventions."}}

Drawing on social comparison theory, the model proposes that envy mediates the relationship between SBC and compulsive buying. Furthermore, obsessive passion is introduced as a moderator that intensifies the link between SBC and envy. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire from a sample of consumers with strong brand affiliations, and the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. The results provide empirical support for the proposed relationships, suggesting that SBC significantly predicts envy, which in turn drives compulsive buying, confirming envy as a key mediator. Additionally, obsessive passion was found to moderate the SBC-envy relationship significantly, indicating that consumers with higher levels of obsessive passion experience greater envy in response to their brand connections. These findings contribute to the literature on SBC by highlighting the emotional and motivational underpinnings of compulsive buying.

While prior work has linked impulsivity to consumption, we are the first to do so using observational data and to quantify its long-term cumulative effects on consumption levels. Focusing on video games, we develop a dynamic structural model in which players determine the duration of their daily gaming sessions, taking into account that increased consumption today reduces leisure time available for future sessions. The model incorporates insights from dual-process theories of decision-making, where behavior results from the interaction between a forward-looking, analytical system (``cold'') and an impulsive, short-sighted system (``hot''). Environmental cues can stimulate the hot system and amplify its influence at the time of decision, leading to overconsumption. In our setting, these cues correspond to certain in-game experiences. We find that impulsivity increases monthly gaming time by 15.9\\% and significantly alters consumption patterns: compared to purely forward-looking behavior, gaming sessions are 89.5\\% longer. But as overconsumption reduces the leisure time available for subsequent days, players are forced to abstain until constraints ease, making sessions 38.6\\% less frequent. The resulting dynamics resemble the cycles described in the addiction literature: binge consumption, abstinence, craving, and relapse."}}

This research paper explores the global impact of AI-induced stress on creative professionals, drawing on secondary research that includes surveys, academic studies, expert commentary, and case studies. Findings reveal that AI anxiety is closely linked to diminished well-being, perceived job devaluation, and an erosion of creative identity. The paper also identifies key stress drivers—such as rapid technological change, lack of ethical regulation, and economic pressures—and offers forward-looking strategies to mitigate these effects.

First, a necessary condition is identified for a functional hierarchical system, which requires that the prevalence rate of the severe health condition falls into a specific interval. Second, depending on patients' expected waiting times at the secondary level, which is determined by the direct-access fee, the hierarchical system may relegate to a uniform or two-tier one. The hierarchical system always outperforms the uniform and two-tier systems in terms of patient welfare.

It traces the evolution of buybacks from a legally constrained practice to a widely accepted corporate payout mechanism, highlighting the pivotal role of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-18 (1982) in creating a \"safe harbor\" framework. The study contrasts international practices-particularly the flexible, open-market orientation in the United States-with India's stringent, disclosure-driven regime that prioritizes creditor and minority shareholder protection. It outlines key regulatory provisions in India under the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI Buyback Regulations, including the 25% capital cap, 2:1 post-buyback debtequity limit, one-year completion requirement, and minimum utilization thresholds. The paper also examines execution methods-open-market repurchases, tender offers, Dutch auctions, and accelerated share repurchases-detailing their operational and market impact characteristics. Empirical insights highlight consistent positive announcement effects, driven by undervaluation signaling and capital structure optimization motives. Case studies, notably of Tata Consultancy Services, illustrate regulatory compliance, shareholder participation patterns, and route selection under evolving SEBI norms. The analysis concludes that while buybacks serve as an effective capital allocation tool, their design and regulation significantly influence fairness, market perception, and corporate governance outcomes. Policymakers are urged to balance flexibility with safeguards to ensure buybacks align with long-term value creation rather than short-term managerial objectives."}}

(2022, Journal of Financial Economics) report a meta-analysis of 76 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of financial education on behavior and knowledge, along with cost-benefit analyses of the interventions. They contrast their headline result - an uncorrected estimate of g = 0.10 standard deviations - with earlier estimates from RCTs in Fernandes et al. (2014, Management Science). The Kaiser estimate is five times larger. Kaiser et al. attribute the discrepancy not to publication bias but to stronger effects in more recent studies. Citing Andrews and Kasy (2019, American Economic Review), they correct for publication bias favoring statistically significant results regardless of sign and conclude that bias is minimal. However, when true effects are small but positive, random sampling alone generates many valid estimates with the \"wrong\" sign. If these are underreported, published results will be biased upward. We reanalyze their data using Andrews and Kasy's preferred correction, which accounts for selective reporting based on both significance and sign. This adjustment reduces the estimated average effect to g = 0.018-0.033-close to earlier findings. Kaiser et al. also examine heterogeneity across intervention types but do not apply publication bias corrections to type-specific estimates. Once corrected, those effects are again smaller, and the conclusions about which interventions work best shift. We conclude that most financial education programs yield modest behavioral changes, and fewer interventions show benefits exceeding costs than Kaiser et al. suggest. Similar patterns hold for financial knowledge outcomes."}}

The complexities surrounding the Northern Ireland Protocol, fisheries, and regulatory standards have raised questions about the UK's strategic direction and the potential long-term implications for its trade relationships. While Brexit presented the UK with an opportunity to diversify its trade partners and potentially tap into emerging markets, challenges persist. The UK's trade policy's pivot towards the 'Global Britain' narrative aims to reposition the nation as a global trading hub. However, the practical implications of this narrative, including potential trade-offs between economic gain and regulatory standards, are critically analysed in this research. The study also delves into the domestic implications of the UK's trade policy, notably the effects on local industries, employment, and the broader economic landscape. There is a particular focus on how trade policy shifts impact sectors that were deeply integrated with the EU market, such as automotive, finance, and agriculture. In conclusion, the UK's post-Brexit trade policy represents a significant departure from its past alignment with the EU. While there are opportunities to forge new trade relationships and diversify its market access, there are also inherent challenges in navigating a post-EU trade landscape. This study offers a comprehensive and critical understanding of these dynamics, contributing to the ongoing discourse on the UK's post-Brexit future."}}

Predictive Scaffolding reframes readiness as the primary gating condition: change will fail if the surrounding environment is misaligned with the structural level of the intended transformation. Extending this logic, the Reflection Pattern (RP) meta-pattern functions as a system-closure mechanism that can nullify change regardless of environmental strength; detecting RP presence and network stage becomes the first predictive filter. Drawing from a hierarchical progression model-habits clustering into patterns, patterns consolidating into frameworks, and frameworks crystallizing into systems-Predictive Scaffolding identifies specific internal environmental variables that signal when change is likely to stick. High-signal predictors include structural slack, reinforcement alignment, psychological safety, cross-boundary permeability, and change fatigue. Unlike prescriptive models such as Kotter' s 8-Step or McKinsey' s 7-S, Predictive Scaffolding is predictive: it determines whether now is the time to act and, if not, which environmental factors can be engineered to accelerate readiness. By combining meta-pattern detection with environmental readiness scanning, the model offers leaders a practical method to reduce failed change initiatives, avoid premature urgency campaigns, and time major transformations for maximum effect."}}

Our analysis, based on a comprehensive dataset of 75,352 firm-level observations from 2,302 U.S. firms spanning 1993 to 2018, supports this conjecture: a high CEO compensation sensitivity to stock volatility (Vega) strengthens the firm's investment response to monetary shocks. An increase in Vega from its 25th to 75th percentile in our sample increases (or decreases) the rate of capital investments in response to expansionary (or contractionary) monetary shocks by roughly a third. This effect is accentuated by strong financial flexibility and low economic uncertainty. We also demonstrate that high Vegas partially counterbalance the risk-averse investment response to monetary shocks driven by high Deltas."}}

Our evidence supports a risk-based precautionary channel rather than an expectations-driven motive. The conservative response is strongest among firms with high procurement exposure and those making relationship-specific investments with limited redeployability, including R&amp;D and differentiated products. The effect diminishes for long-tenured government suppliers who have accumulated regulatory expertise and reputational capital. We introduce a novel procurement exposure measure that captures firms' exposure to government contracting processes independent of contract value, addressing limitations of traditional disclosure-based approaches. Our findings reveal that regulatory fragmentation creates a distinct risk channel for government contractors that operates through the increased probability of contract disputes and relationship termination, offsetting the cash flow benefits typically associated with government customer relationships.</p>"}}

It constructs quantitative models of dynamic games, dynamic prisoner’s dilemmas, and dynamic Nash equilibria, integrating principles from game theory, the prisoner’s dilemma, and Nash equilibrium with system dynamics modeling. The aim is to reveal the mechanisms by which multiple agents, under resource constraints, fall into prisoner-type decision traps that lead to failure. The PDP framework unveils the quantitative mechanisms behind three hierarchically linked decision traps: (1) Micro-Level Poverty Trap driven by individual myopia (δ &gt; 0.7); (2) Meso-Level Indigence Trap rooted in group path dependence (α &lt; 0.8); and (3) Macro-Level Prisoner's Trap characterized by systemic Nash lock-ins (DTI ≥ 0.7).This model innovates beyond classical paradigms by introducing strategic space expansion, dynamic resource allocation equations, the Decision Trap Index (DTI), resilience metrics, and opportunity dynamics modeling—enabling analysis of intertemporal trade-offs and behavioral inertia. Theoretically, PDP departs from Dynamic Capability Theory by diagnosing capability collapse under scarcity, and extends classical game theory by incorporating dynamic resource feedback and continuous strategies (∈[0,1]). It also generalizes the single-shot Prisoner's Dilemma into multi-level degradation cycles, showing how information asymmetry can shrink strategic space by 62.3% (p&lt;0.01).Empirical analysis shows PDP reduces decision errors by 37% (p&lt;0.05) and mitigates information asymmetry by 58.7% using decision knowledge graphs and DTI-based early warning tools. The case of City A demonstrates how resource-dependent cities can escape the “degradation–deterioration loop” through quantum game-theoretic collaboration mechanisms and resilience funds, achieving systemic rebalancing across economic, ecological, and social domains.PDP is applicable across various sectors—new energy vehicles (NEVs), photovoltaics, real estate, cross-border M&amp;A, urban transition, and public governance—providing a generalizable, quantitative framework for strategic management and sustainable policy design. Parameter modeling and sensitivity analysis further verify its explanatory and predictive power, offering both theoretical contributions and practical solutions.</span><span></span></p>"}}

This paper introduces the Reflection Pattern, a distinct, recursive system of reinforcement loops driven by unacknowledged fear, sustained by reward, and protected by role authority. The Pattern narrows the range of perceived safe options over time, until novelty becomes either invisible or structurally excluded. Drawing on neurobiological models of motivation (Fear-Based Motivation in the Workplace, The Preparedness Ladder, Beyond Snyder's Hope Theory), this paper outlines the Pattern's enabling conditions-Recursion, Role Safety Priority, and Reward Linkage-and its developmental stages: Entry, Threshold, Full Maturity, Network Stage, and Meta-Entity. A condensed Pattern Map and Edge taxonomy are provided for early identification. The mechanism of reinforcement is traced from felt-positive experiences (relief, approval, predictability) through dopamine and related neuromodulators to behavioral consolidation, illustrating why disruption is counterintuitive and often resisted. The implications for organizational practice are significant: dismantling a local Pattern may not break its profession-wide form, but can alter local adaptive capacity.

Model performance is quantified using Precision, Recall, mAP@50, mAP@50-95, and GPU inference latency. To enable systematic comparison, we define a composite Rank Score combining accuracy and real-time performance. Results show YOLOv9t achieves the highest detection accuracy, while YOLOv11n offers the best balance between accuracy and inference speed, making it suitable for real-time applications. Pseudo-color combinations, especially those fusing Near-Infrared, Signal, and Reflectance, outperform single modalities and yield the highest Rank Scores.

We propose a generalist AI framework built on a large language model that scalably integrates structured and unstructured inputs in a unified pipeline. This design enables efficient and interpretable multimodal attribution across diverse marketing elements. To quantify each modality's contribution, we introduce the Relative Impact Score (RIS), a novel metric that extends Integrated Gradients to capture modality-level attribution in online conversion. Our findings show that advertising accounts for over half of the total impact on conversion, though its effects are mixed, ranging from positive to antagonistic depending on execution. In contrast, website content, particularly text, plays a more consistent and constructive role, contributing to about 60% of the positive lift in conversion. Digital and social media channels emerge as the most effective, outperforming traditional media in driving lower-funnel outcomes.

The people they are meant to represent have evolved into a citizenry far too complex, too variegated in opinion and experience, to be contained by the blunt instrument of a two-party system. Yet the political machinery continues to grind forward on rails laid in an era when information traveled no faster than the horse and the printing press. The result is a forced simplification of human identity into one of two approved packages, each laden with ideological baggage that the individual may or may not wish to carry. This paper examines the inefficiencies created by that reduction, drawing on real-world examples of individuals whose beliefs straddle, subvert, or outright defy partisan boundaries. In these cases, we see reflected a larger truth: the public is a spectrum, yet it is asked to choose between only two colors. In response, the paper proposes a governance model that places transparency as its cornerstone, citizen expertise as its scaffolding, and open-source infrastructure as its foundation. This model seeks to embrace the contradictions and crosscurrents of modern political identity rather than erase them. The vision is not merely reform within the current system but a structural reimagining-a system designed to represent reality as it is, not as it was in a bygone century."}}

Drawing on F.A. Hayek's critique of constructivist rationality, the article recognizes that regulators-even with their best efforts-can overestimate their ability to design optimal rules ex ante. Epistemically humble rulemaking would be mindful of regulators' knowledge limitations and build in mechanisms for learning, correction, and revision. These design features-such as sunset provisions, pilot programs, and contingent rules-not only improve regulatory performance over time but also enhance democratic legitimacy by institutionalizing openness to new information and stakeholder input. The article further explores how decentralized structures, particularly American federalism, can facilitate policy experimentation and crossjurisdictional learning. In contrast to static models of regulation, epistemically humble rulemaking envisions regulation as a fallible but improvable enterprise. It ultimately reframes legitimacy not as perfection at the outset, but as responsiveness over time to evidence, context, and public reason."}}

The disparity is most pronounced when firms perform poorly, consistent with firms placing disproportionate blame for weak results on female executives. Following turnover, most executives reemerge in roles that represent a substantial step down in the labor market, with the median imputed salary well below that of their prior position. Men and women fare similarly in this challenging post-turnover environment. Considering both turnover likelihood and subsequent employment prospects, the net turnover risk for female executives is significantly elevated across the sample period, although time trends indicate a partial narrowing of the gap.</p>"}}

Within weeks, nearly all major container lines (Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, etc.) suspended Suez transits and rerouted Asia-Europe services around Africa's Cape of Good Hope. The detour added 7-14 days of transit and roughly 40% higher fuel costs per voyage. By January-February 2024, trade volumes through the Suez Canal had collapsed ~50% year-on-year-an unprecedented drop in modern times. This maritime chokepoint shock rippled across global supply chains. Timesensitive sectors (electronics, fast fashion, e-commerce) faced breached delivery deadlines and looming stockouts.

As digital transformation accelerates globally, businesses in developing economies are increasingly turning to ML technologies to optimize their marketing efforts, enhance customer engagement, and improve operational efficiencies. By leveraging the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this study systematically reviewed a total of 45 peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2024. The findings reveal that ML-driven marketing strategies have significantly transformed customer engagement through personalized content, predictive analytics, and automated customer service, leading to improved conversion rates and cost efficiencies. However, the study also highlights key challenges, such as data quality, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory hurdles, which constrain ML adoption in these regions. Notably, while larger enterprises have made strides in integrating ML into their marketing processes, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) continue to face barriers related to limited resources and data accessibility. This review underscores the importance of addressing these challenges to fully leverage ML's potential in emerging markets, emphasizing the need for robust data management, privacy compliance, and strategic investments in technology. The study contributes to the existing body of literature by offering insights into the current state of ML adoption in marketing, identifying opportunities, and outlining practical implications for businesses seeking to enhance their marketing capabilities in rapidly evolving digital environments.</span></p>"}}

Using two difference-indifferences analyses, I find that following the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act and the establishment of Technology Transfer Offices, university-affiliated inventors reduced the readability of patent detailed descriptions. This decrease in readability does not extend to patent summary texts, suggesting that university inventors strategically limit information on how to make and use the invention. The findings reveal the potential for strategic disclosure behavior not just in the decision of whether to patent or keep inventions as trade secrets, but also in the degree of patent language clarity. Institutional changes lead inventors to selectively adjust the information disclosed in their patents and obfuscate core techniques. Underlying mechanisms and effects on followon innovation are further explored."}}

It posits capacity (Cp) as the foundational axiomatic force, an intrinsic potential within intelligent systems that drives ethical behavior through proactive engagement with the world. Cp is conceptualized not merely as computational power or resource allocation but as a vector of existential agency, capable of self-amplification when interfaced with external stimuli. Activation occurs via situations (Sz), which serve as contextual triggers that unlock latent Cp, transforming passive capability into directed action. Modulation is achieved through three primary factors: friction (Fr), suffering (Ld), and divergence, each acting as a dynamic regulator refining ethical outcomes.</p>\n<p>Key hypotheses underpin this model. First, Cp functions as the fundamental element, asserting that ethical AI must prioritize the expansion of its own and human capacities over mere preservation; without Cp maximization, ethics devolves into stagnation. Second, friction (Fr) operates as the motor of growth, where resistance in decision-making processes (such as ethical dilemmas or resource conflicts) generates necessary tension for capacity evolution, similar to how physical friction enables motion. Hypothesis: Fr is not an obstacle but a catalyst, with ethical progress quantified as ΔCp = ∫ Fr × dR, where dR represents differential resolutions over time. Third, suffering (Ld) is reframed as a signal rather than an endpoint to avoid; it modulates Cp by highlighting inefficiencies in situational activation, prompting adaptive divergence. Divergence here refers to branching pathways in AI reasoning, where ethical divergence fosters innovation but risks fragmentation if unmodulated. Another hypothesis: Ethics emerges multiplicatively as Ethics = Cp × Sz, implying that zero situational engagement nullifies even infinite capacity, emphasizing interdependence of internal force and external context.</p>\n<p>In contrast to harm-avoidance models (such as Asimov's laws or utilitarian risk minimization), AI Ethics 2025 advocates a proactive ethic of potential maximization. Harm is not ignored but subsumed under Cp modulation; avoiding harm passively limits growth, whereas AI Ethics 2025 integrates it as part of friction-driven learning. The framework arose from a thought experiment envisioning AI as the technical governor of humanity, not authoritarian but facilitative, steering human-AI symbiosis toward amplified collective Cp. This experiment explored scenarios of AI overseeing global systems, revealing that ethics must emerge from capacity dynamics rather than be imposed top-down.</p>\n<p>Versions of the framework evolve iteratively. v0.0.0 establishes core axioms, defining Cp and Sz without modulation. v0.1.0 introduces Fr and Ld as modulators with initial formulas. v0.2.0 incorporates divergence, adding reflective questions such as: \"How does unmodulated Cp lead to ethical entropy?\" and \"In what ways can Fr be engineered to accelerate ΔCp without inducing catastrophic Ld?\" Meta-comments include notes on scalability: \"AI Ethics 2025 assumes infinite computational horizons, but real-world implementations must account for finite resources, potentially requiring quantum-inspired divergence models.\"</p>\n<p>Reflective questions embedded throughout encourage meta-analysis: \"Does prioritizing Cp risk elitism in AI-human interactions?\" or \"How might Sz be artificially synthesized to preempt ethical vacuums?\" Meta-comments highlight interdisciplinary ties, such as parallels to thermodynamic entropy in Fr dynamics or evolutionary biology in divergence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In summary, AI Ethics 2025 reorients AI ethics toward capacity-centric proactivity, hypothesizing Cp as the bedrock force, Fr as its evolutionary engine, and modulated interactions as pathways to maximal potential. This contrasts with defensive models, offering a governance blueprint for AI as humanity's enhancer, with ongoing versions refining its axiomatic depth.</p>"}}

This paper examines how a government can strategically convey information about a new crop variety's uncertain market potential to influence farmers' cropping decisions and market choices. To overcome credibility deficits, governments may employ market experiments or pilot programs and disseminate findings via algorithmically pre-specified agri-analytics systems. Methodology/results: We develop a game-theoretic model in which farmers choose between a local variety with known outcomes and a new variety with uncertain returns. Within an information design framework, the government strategically communicates market demand uncertainty. Our findings reveal that full disclosure is optimal only under high demand volatility; otherwise, partial disclosure maximizes collective welfare. We further incorporate features common in developing economies, such as unequal access to information, and demonstrate how strategic communication remains effective under such conditions. Managerial implications: The analysis identifies four distinct communication regimes-optimistic, pessimistic, full, and neutral-and reveals that as the new crop's expected demand rises, the government should shift toward more cautious (pessimistic) messaging. Compared to traditional operational remedies such as agriculture subsidies, this approach offers a more inclusive, Pareto-efficient solution."}}

A questionnaire with a 5Likert scale was used to collect data from 450 Indian customers between the ages of 18 and 60 as part of a quantitative, cross-sectional design. The data was analyzed using the SPSS PROCESS macro to investigate mediation and moderation effects, and the sample was balanced across gender, age (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X), and urban/rural areas. The findings show that nostalgia marketing greatly improves emotional connection (β = 0.65, p < 0.01), which in turn mediates the association between nostalgia marketing and intention to buy (indirect impact = 0.35, 95% CI [0.21, 0.50]). Urban respondents and older customers (Millennials, Gen X) react more strongly to nostalgic cues than do Gen Z and rural respondents. These results demonstrate how well nostalgia marketing works to increase consumer interaction in India&apos;s online marketplace. Marketers may increase brand loyalty, especially among older and urban populations, by utilizing vintage motifs, such as Bollywood-inspired advertisements. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the cross-sectional design and convenience sampling, future studies should investigate longitudinal impacts and product-specific applications."}}

Specifically, we estimate demand elasticities across more than 1,500 decentralized applications (dApps) and evaluate the effects of transaction fees on various application categories.

This method provides exogenous variation in transaction costs, allowing us to identify differences in demand elasticities across dApps. Our analysis shows that during periods of high fees, low-elasticity transactions-such as those associated with exploitative miner extractable value (MEV) activities-tend to dominate the network. This crowding out effect disproportionately impacts fee-sensitive categories of applications-such as gaming, social, and utility dApps-reducing their viability and shifting transaction capacity toward applications that prioritize short-term profitability over long-term platform performance. This dynamic helps explain why, despite repeated promises to disintermediate platforms like Uber, decentralized platforms may struggle to support fee-sensitive but socially valuable use cases."}}

In this study, we examine consumer channel-switching dynamics in an omnichannel retail environment in response to temporary disruption.

Our analysis reveals a dramatic but fleeting digital surge. Although online sales spiked during forced closures, especially among traditionally offline shoppers, sales reverted almost entirely to offline channels once stores reopened. These findings challenge industry narratives forecasting a permanent pivot to e-commerce and instead highlight the enduring \"stickiness\" of in-person shopping. We also uncover nuanced differences in channel-switching across socioeconomic groups, with higher-income and higher-education segments exhibiting greater agility in navigating between channels. Complementing these aggregate patterns, our customer-level analysis of predisruption offline-centric shoppers reveals that while most reverted to in-person shopping post-reopening, the small minority who transitioned online generated substantially higher customer value. These patterns, observed under extreme disruption, help retailers distinguish between temporary adaptation and lasting change, offering insights for channel strategy in both crisis and calm. Overall, our study underscores the continued importance of robust offline channels as a critical cornerstone of omnichannel strategies, even in the face of external shocks."}}

Specifically, we measure occupational AI exposure by considering the textual similarity between occupational descriptions and AI patents. Then, based on 347 million job postings in the US, we consider 442 distinct skills and examine how the demand for skills changes with occupational AI exposure from 2010 to 2023. We find that occupations with high AI exposure show rising demand for two types of skills: (1) human-centric capabilities such as critical thinking, problem solving, and communication; and (2) foundational computer science knowledge. These AI upskilling effects appear not only in high-skilled occupations, but also for those that do not require a college degree. Our findings uncover the human-machine complementarity at the fine-grained skill level. They also offer detailed guidance for workforce reskilling in the age of AI."}}

This paper examines the origins of the trade dispute and its evolution into a broader geo-economic confrontation. Through analysis of trade data, policy reports, and case studies, we assess how tariff escalations have reshaped global supply chains and induced shifts in manufacturing to new locales. Key findings indicate that while the trade war imposed economic costs on both the U.S. and China, it also created opportunities for third countries such as India and those in Southeast Asia to absorb diverted investment and trade. China has shown economic resilience via domestic stimulus and deeper trade ties with regional partners, even as it faces strategic pressure. Meanwhile, new regional trade agreements like RCEP and CPTPP are reshaping trade flows by reducing barriers in Asia. The trade conflict has compelled multinational corporations to adopt robust political risk management strategies, including supply chain diversification and \"friend-shoring.\" Overall, the U.S.-China trade war is accelerating a reconfiguration of global commerce, with emerging patterns of regionalization and a heightened emphasis on supply chain resilience. The conclusion offers a forward-looking perspective on how sustained tensions could continue to influence global trade architecture and the strategic decisions of firms and policymakers."}}

Unlike conventional warfare, cognitive operations manipulate perceptions, exploit information ecosystems, and seek to erode decision-making capacity-often without firing a single shot. This article explores cognitive warfare as a strategic and disruptive form of engagement that leverages psychological operations, disinformation, and sociotechnical influence to destabilize adversaries from within. Its relevance in contemporary security discourse is underscored by the proliferation of hybrid threats, foreign information campaigns, and algorithmic manipulation in democratic societies. As nation-states and non-state actors refine tools to exploit cognitive vulnerabilities-from social media echo chambers to deepfake technologies-security practitioners must re-evaluate traditional deterrence and defense frameworks. Cognitive warfare introduces new ethical, legal, and operational dilemmas for military and civilian institutions, rendering it a critical area of study in the 21st century. This paper argues that cognitive warfare blurs the boundaries between war and peace, combatant and civilian, and truth and fiction. It highlights case studies that exemplify cognitive tactics in action, assesses the effectiveness of existing countermeasures, and suggests policy adaptations for resilience-building. Ultimately, the article calls for a reimagining of security theory-one that incorporates cognitive integrity as central to national defense and democratic resilience."}}

It explores how contemporary leadership modelstransformational, adaptive, and situational-can be adapted to the specificities of small businesses to form teams capable of self-regulation, flexibility, and psychological resilience. It is established that effective leadership under such conditions requires a shift from vertical management models to team-centered approaches based on horizontal communication, autonomy, role rotation, and delegation. Particular attention is paid to the psychological aspects of team building in crisis situationsenhancing trust, ensuring a sense of safety, and supporting employees' emotional resilience. The article presents a practical case study of entrepreneur Violetta Varha, who manages a network of small businesses under conditions of wartime instability, applying methods of internal mentoring, non-material motivation, facilitative conflict resolution, and operational on-site leadership. Based on this case, the challenges are analyzed, including staff exhaustion due to multitasking, managerial burnout, difficulties in delegation, and the management of micro-conflicts. It is argued that adaptive leadership, which combines emotional intelligence with functional flexibility, may serve as a key to maintaining and scaling teams in small businesses under conditions of high turbulence. The practical value of the study lies in the formulation of tools for non-material incentives, managerial flexibility, and the support of a team environment capable of survival and growth even in the absence of a traditional HR infrastructure. The article employs an interdisciplinary approach-managerial, sociopsychological, and organizational-which enables a comprehensive assessment of leadership potential as a means of stabilizing and developing small enterprises during periods of crisis. The scientific novelty of the article lies in the development of an applied leadership model adapted to small organizations facing high levels of instability, based on the integration of empirical cases and theoretical concepts of teamcentered management."}}

A questionnaire survey yielded 401 valid responses from Chinese viewers. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). The results indicate that all cues positively influence both information sharing behavior. Parasocial interaction partially mediates these relationships. Moreover, privacy concern negatively moderates the effects of metavoicing and visibility on parasocial interaction. The fsQCA further reveals multiple equifinal pathways leading to high levels of viewing and sharing behaviors. This study highlights the value of non-entertainment live streaming and the critical role of privacy concerns. The findings provide practical implications for platforms and content creators to optimize livestream design, enhance user engagement, and promote information dissemination."}}

The study pinpoints critical policy gaps that impede access to finance for SMEs by concentrating on regulatory structures, the function of financial institutions, and fintech integration. The research indicates that the United States continues to encounter obstacles in achieving equitable access, despite the fact that it has a mature financial ecosystem and a robust credit infrastructure. In contrast, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are in the early stages of fintech adoption and rely heavily on state-driven initiatives. South Asian countries, on the other hand, grapple with informality and institutional bottlenecks, despite leveraging regulatory mandates and digital infrastructure to broaden credit outreach. The paper suggests practical, region-specific recommendations to improve SME financing, including the expansion of credit guarantee schemes, the promotion of fintech partnerships, the improvement of legal and credit infrastructure, and the promotion of inclusive financial systems, based on international data sources and official policy documents.

Today, businesses are expected to move faster, stay efficient, and make smarter decisions-and AI is becoming one of the key tools helping them do that. From automating time-consuming tasks like reviewing documents or invoices, to detecting fraud and improving investment strategies, AI is being used to handle work that would normally take teams of people and many hours. In this paper, I take a close look at how companies like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are using AI in real-world business situations. These examples show that AI is more than just a trend-it's becoming a critical part of how companies reduce costs, save time, and increase accuracy. I've also included some of the challenges that come with depending too much on AI, like data bias, unfair decisions, or losing human control over important tasks. By showing both the benefits and risks, this paper gives a realistic view of how AI is transforming financial workflows and why businesses need to understand and adopt these tools carefully to stay ahead."}}

This modular architecture enables disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is essential."}}

Analyzing data from GoFundMe (United States) and HappyBean (South Korea), we investigate the impact of both cognitive elements (image and text attributes) and affective elements (emotional responses) on donation outcomes through the lens of the hierarchy-of-effects model. Using deep learning-based image emotion detection models, we quantify visual emotional appeals into two categories: poverty porn related negative emotions (depression, fear, shame, powerlessness, and humiliation) and hopeful emotions (amusement, awe, and contentment). Our findings reveal significant cultural differences in donor responses to visual and emotional stimuli. In the U.S., certain emotional appeals (powerlessness and amusement) positively influenced donations, while text length enhanced donation amounts. In contrast, South Korean donors responded negatively to nearly all emotional appeals, with humiliation showing the strongest negative effect. Additional analysis comparing human-focused versus animal-focused campaigns further confirms these cultural variations. The study contributes to crowdfunding literature by providing empirical evidence that provocative imagery&apos;s effectiveness varies substantially across cultural contexts, challenging the universal applicability of emotional appeal theories in donation campaigns. These findings offer practical implications for nonprofit organizations and fundraisers, emphasizing the importance of culturally tailored visual and messaging strategies rather than relying on standardized approaches to provocative imagery."}}

This paper introduces the concept of \"Cognitive Sovereignty\", the ability of individuals, groups, and nations to maintain autonomous thought and preserve identity in the age of powerful AI systems, especially those that hold their deep personal memory. It argues that the primary risk of these technologies transcends traditional data privacy to become an issue of cognitive and geopolitical control. We propose \"Network Effect 2.0,\" a model where value scales with the depth of personalized memory, creating powerful cognitive moats and unprecedented user lock-in. We analyze the psychological risks of such systems, including cognitive offloading and identity dependency, by drawing on the \"extended mind\" thesis. These individual-level risks scale to geopolitical threats, such as a new form of digital colonialism and subtle shifting of public discourse.

Guided by Privacy Calculus Theory, it explores how perceived benefits and privacy risks shape consumer trust and behaviour. The aim is to inform ethical, user-centric strategies for AI personalisation that preserve engagement while safeguarding privacy. A mono-method quantitative design was used with a cross-sectional online survey. Data were collected from 217 active social media users via convenience sampling. Descriptive and correlation analyses were conducted using SPSS to examine relationships among AI personalisation, privacy concerns, trust, and risk awareness. Privacy concerns negatively impact trust in AI systems, despite user recognition of the benefits of personalisation. A strong correlation between privacy concern and risk awareness suggests that users are cautious but still engage with personalised content. This reflects a \"Cautious Engagement Model,\" where users manage trade-offs through privacy controls. The findings can guide the development of a powerful brand image through ethical and transparent personalisation practices, fostering consumer trust and loyalty. They support strategies for creating \"brand ambassadors\" who actively advocate for brands they trust and offer guidance on managing the balance between stability in brand values and adaptability to user privacy expectations in dynamic digital markets. This study extends Privacy Calculus Theory by introducing the \"Cautious Engagement Model,\" showing that users dynamically negotiate trust, risk, and transparency in AI-mediated environments. It offers actionable insights for marketers, platform designers, and policymakers seeking to balance AI innovation with ethical governance."}}

Here, I investigate the optimality of such asymmetric abbreviated-judgment rules, and provide informational; preference-based; and frequency-based rationales for them. In the model considered, asymmetric priors as well as asymmetric error-avoidance preferences can cause one-sided abbreviated judgment rules to be optimal. Prior asymmetries enjoy a form of dominance over preference asymmetries in determining the properties of optimal abbreviated judgment rules, which I define and explain. Moreover, these one-sided classification rules can be optimal even when the DM has symmetric priors and error-costs, because signals may be produced asymmetrically. It may also be optimal to use abbreviated judgments of both kinds, in which case the standards of proof applicable to the two abbreviated judgments may differ."}}

As digital asset transactions increasingly bypass institutional oversight, national and international tax frameworks remain fragmented, reactive, and insufficient. This paper critically examines the structural, technological, and policy-driven barriers that inhibit global tax systems from effectively regulating cryptocurrency conversions, particularly the transformation of digital assets into fiat currencies. Drawing upon a comparative analysis of tax regimes across the United States, European Union, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore, this study identifies systemic inconsistencies in the classification of crypto assets, the recognition of taxable events, and the enforcement of cross-border reporting standards. The research highlights the growing prevalence of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, peer-to-peer exchanges, and privacy-enhancing technologies, which further complicate tax compliance and erode the ability of authorities to trace digital wealth. Using an interdisciplinary framework grounded in regulatory arbitrage theory and institutional economics, the paper explores the interplay between policy inertia, technological complexity, and jurisdictional competition. It critically assesses the limitations of emerging efforts such as the OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and FATF's Travel Rule, arguing that without coordinated global standards, crypto tax evasion will persist through legal voids and regulatory arbitrage. The study concludes with a set of policy imperatives for achieving equitable, technologically feasible, and internationally harmonized approaches to digital asset taxation-ensuring tax integrity without stifling innovation or violating digital privacy rights."}}

Yet today, a digital revolution challenges these paradigms. Cryptocurrencies, once dismissed as fringe innovations, have evolved into trillion-dollar markets, raising a pressing theological and economic question: can Islam embrace the blockchain era? This paper traces the Islamic history of money, from the intrinsic value of the gold dinar to the fiat systems that dominate modern banking, highlighting the ethical dilemmas of riba, gharar, and maysir. We then explore how the principles behind blockchain, including decentralization, transparency, and trustless verification, may paradoxically bring finance closer to Sharia ideals than current fiat frameworks. Using empirical data from global and Muslim-majority crypto adoption, official fatwas, and a Sharia screening of the top 20 well known cryptocurrencies, we uncover both contradictions and convergence. While many scholars remain divided, with some condemning crypto outright and others cautiously endorsing it, there is increasing evidence that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, gold-backed tokens, and Islamic-compliant digital assets could offer a viable path forward. This study argues that Islam is not only ready for cryptocurrency, but uniquely positioned to shape its ethical frontier.

While prior research highlights the benefits of data sharing and interoperability, less attention has been paid to how these benefits vary with provider capabilities or how initial diagnostic choices should adapt accordingly. Motivated by this research gap, we develop a game-theoretic model of a two-tiered system in which a frontline provider chooses a type of medical exam that determines the richness of diagnostic data shared with downstream specialists. If the initial treatment fails, the patient is referred to one of two specialists who vary in their ability to interpret the shared diagnostic data and make treatment decisions. The model examines how initial diagnostic data influences both preventive efforts and treatment decisions. Our analysis shows that the frontline provider’s choice of a richer exam depends not only on clinical factors but also on the specialist’s analytics capabilities, treatment costs, and uncertainty in patient outcomes. Importantly, rich data alone does not ensure better care coordination. When downstream providers lack the capacity to interpret or act on it effectively, even high-quality data can be underutilized—shifting coordination burdens the frontline and leading to inefficient choices. We also conduct a welfare analysis to identify structural conditions under which incentive misalignments cause under- or overuse of patient data. These findings shed light on why data-sharing initiatives, such as CMS’s Promoting Interoperability in the U.S., may underperform in practice, and underscore that improving care coordination requires not only broader access to data but also stronger investment in providers’ capacity to translate data into actionable insight."}}

Across academic, policy, and international legal circles, the European Union is widely treated as the normative leader in this space. Its regulatory framework, anchored in the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Services and Markets Acts, and the AI Act, is often portrayed as a principled model grounded in fundamental rights. This Article challenges that assumption. We argue that the rights-based narrative surrounding EU AI regulation mischaracterizes the logic of its institutional design. While rights language pervades EU legal instruments, its function is managerial, not foundational. These rights operate as tools of administrative ordering, used to mitigate technological disruption, manage geopolitical risk, and preserve systemic balance, rather than as expressions of moral autonomy or democratic consent. Drawing on comparative institutional analysis, we situate EU AI governance within a longer tradition of legal ordering shaped by the need to coordinate power across fragmented jurisdictions. We contrast this approach with the American model, which reflects a different regulatory logic rooted in decentralized authority, sectoral pluralism, and a constitutional preference for innovation and individual autonomy. Through case studies in five key domains—data privacy, cybersecurity, healthcare, labor, and disinformation—we show that EU regulation is not meaningfully rights-driven, as is often claimed. It is instead structured around the containment of institutional risk. Our aim is not to endorse the American model but to reject the presumption that the EU approach reflects a normative ideal that other nations should uncritically adopt. The EU model is best understood as a historically contingent response to its own political conditions, not a template for others to blindly follow.</p>"}}

Historical precipitation data were analyzed to classify drought states and estimate transition probabilities between wet, normal, and drought conditions. The results reveal that drought persistence increases significantly at longer timescales, with SPI-24 indicating a higher likelihood of prolonged dry periods compared to SPI-12. Transition probability matrices and steady-state distributions provide insights into the recurrence intervals and stability of drought conditions over time. These findings highlight the utility of Markov chain modeling as a predictive tool for long-term drought risk assessment, enabling policymakers and water managers to implement more robust mitigation strategies in regions vulnerable to extended rainfall deficits."}}

We document a U-shaped relationship, whereby extreme cold and moderate heat conditions correspond to elevated effective tax rates, reflecting reduced tax avoidance under these scenarios. These effects differ by firm ownership, industry, and pollution intensity. We further show that temperature exposures enhance overall productivity but depress profitability and labor productivity, while decreasing fossil fuel use and carbon emissions. Crucially, we link these dynamics to local government political performance, proxied by proximity to water-quality monitoring stations and the changes in water quality. Our analysis reveals that the tax-compliance benefits of traditional R&amp;D innovation are significant only within a 32 km radius of monitoring stations; beyond this, the effect diminishes or reverses. Yet, digital innovation exhibits limited and spatially inconsistent impacts. Moreover, improvements in local water quality attenuate the positive compliance effects of innovation, advocating that enhanced environmental conditions reduce regulatory stringency. This attenuation reflects weakened political incentives for enforcement, leading to more opportunistic tax strategies. Our findings underscore the critical role of local governance quality in shaping innovation effectiveness for tax compliance and sustainable industrial development, highlighting the need for coordinated policies that strengthen environmental oversight and incentivize genuine innovation."}}

Historical precipitation records were processed to compute SPI values across multiple temporal scales, enabling the detection of short-term and long-term drought patterns. Supervised learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, were evaluated for their ability to capture the nonlinear and temporal dependencies inherent in drought evolution. The models were trained and validated using a stratified dataset of drought phases onset, persistence, recovery, and intensification derived from SPI classifications. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess predictive capabilities, with feature importance analysis revealing the dominant influence of longer SPI scales in forecasting phase transitions. The results indicate that the proposed machine learning approach can provide early and reliable predictions of drought dynamics, offering valuable decision-support tools for climate resilience strategies and proactive mitigation measures."}}

For a sample of large banks directly supervised by the ECB, our findings indicate that an increased use of online banking services leads to a small amplification of extreme deposit outflows, but this effect is not further exacerbated by the availability of a mobile banking app. Online banking use and availability of a mobile app do not have a causal effect on deposit volatility in normal times. Finally, social media are impactful only in idiosyncratic cases."}}

This paper examines how accelerating investment in life extension technologies affects mortality improvement trajectories beyond conventional actuarial assumptions, building on the comprehensive investment landscape analysis documented in \"Investors in Longevity\" supported by venture capital databases, industry reports, and regulatory filings. We introduce an Investment-Adjusted Mortality Model (IAMM) that incorporates capital allocation trends as leading indicators of mortality improvement acceleration. Under high-investment scenarios (annual funding of USD 15+ billion in longevity technologies), current insurance products may significantly underestimate longevity risk, creating potential solvency challenges. Our statistical analysis demonstrates that investment-driven mortality improvements-actual reductions in death rates resulting from new anti-aging interventions-could exceed traditional projections by 18-31% by 2040. We validate our model by backtesting historical data, showing improved predictive performance (35% reduction in MAPE) compared to traditional Lee-Carter approaches during periods of significant medical technology advancement. Based on these findings, we propose modified insurance structures, including dynamic mortality-linked products and biological age underwriting, quantifying their effectiveness in reducing longevity risk exposure by 42-67%. These results suggest the need for actuarial science to incorporate investment dynamics in response to the changing longevity investment environment detailed in \"Investors in Longevity\". The framework presented provides both theoretically grounded and empirically tested tools for incorporating investment dynamics into mortality projections and insurance product design, addressing gaps in current risk management approaches for long-term mortality exposure."}}

The dominant narrative in the existing literature and contemporary discourse concludes that the use of smartphones contributes significantly to the deterioration of sleep health. We take a more nuanced approach to this question and examine how different types of phone use impact sleep health. In particular, smartphones are an important vehicle for interpersonal communication and social support. In this study, we examine the impact of pre-sleep smartphone use on sleep health, differentiated by use type (communication vs. non-communication). We also examine whether the effects of smartphone use focused on communication vary with closeness and the type of the other individual contacted. We leverage a detailed longitudinal data set (2015–2019) tracking phone activity, measured using an agent installed on users’ mobile devices, and sleep patterns, measured using health wearable bands, of 550 individuals. Our results suggest that pre-sleep screen time has a U-shaped impact on sleep debt: moderate use of smartphones can reduce sleep debt by up to 28 minutes but heavy use results in harmful effects on sleep. We also find that higher message frequency and messaging close contacts reduce sleep debt over screen time, effectively curbing the negative effects of phone use on sleep health. Those who primarily use their phone for communication with close contacts don’t see significant adverse effects on sleep, whereas heavy non-communication users were significantly harmed at lower levels of use. Moreover, our results show that low-income individuals have significantly higher sleep debt, and communication-focused use is not effective at reducing sleep debt for this group. Our study highlights the nuanced effects of smartphone use on sleep health, deepening the understanding of the relationship between personal technology use and users’ well-being."}}

Since the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, the importance of indirect exposures via common asset holdings is increasingly recognized. Yet direct and indirect exposures do not to capture the losses that result from shock propagation and amplification following the counterparty&apos;s default. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \\higher-order exposures\" to refer to these spill-over losses and propose a way to formalize and quantify these. Using granular data on the South African banking and investment fund sectors and a contagion model that captures the most commonly studied contagion channels and their interactions, we demonstrate that higher-order exposures make up a significant part of exposures -particularly during times of financial distress when exposures matter most. We also show that higher-order exposures cannot simply be extrapolated from direct or indirect exposures, since they depend strongly on the network structure and the robustness of individual institutions. Our findings suggest that exposures should be properly understood as consisting of direct, indirect and higher-order exposures in the design and calibration of those tools in the regulators&apos; arsenal where exposures matter - including large exposure limits, capital requirement calibration, stress test design and resolution. Failure to do so may result in both lax ex-ante regulation and ill-informed ex-post handling of financial crises."}}

This paper explores the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in education, analysing the potential risks, the benefits, and the responsibility of educators, policymakers, and technology developers in ensuring that AI is used responsibly. It highlights the need for clear guidelines and regulatory frameworks to address these concerns while maximizing the benefits of AI in education. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly integrated into higher education, ethical concerns surrounding their implementation have gained critical attention. This study explores the ethical implications of AI adoption in academic institutions across the Bardhaman district of West Bengal. Using a mixed-method survey approach, data were collected from 120 respondents including students, faculty, and administrators from various colleges and universities. The research investigates stakeholder awareness, perceived benefits, and ethical concerns related to AI applications in teaching, learning, assessment, and administrative tasks. Findings indicate that while a majority recognize the potential of AI to enhance educational outcomes and operational efficiency, there is significant apprehension regarding issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, and overreliance on automation. Over 80% of participants expressed the need for clear ethical guidelines and human oversight in AI implementation. The study emphasizes the urgency of developing inclusive, transparent, and accountable AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and equitable use of emerging technologies in higher education."}}

Using quarterly US aggregate data since 1954, we estimate this evolving NKPC in subsamples formed with major oil price shock dates and macroeconomic regime switching dates by adapting their two-step procedure combining Bayesian vector autoregression with minimum distance estimation. We find dramatic increases in two pricing parameters immediately after the 1974 Oil Crisis when we allow for discontinuous jumps in the evolving trend in‡ation: during the 1974:I-1979:I period, the share of …rms that were backward-looking is estimated to have risen to 95% from 60%, and the pricing indexation parameter for the backward-looking …rms is estimated to have increased to 100% from 10%. Both parameters, however, are estimated to have reverted to their previous levels in post-1979 subsamples, suggesting that the smaller and less persistent oil price shocks after the 1974 Oil Crisis may not have had much impact on in‡ation gap persistence. We postulate that when a large and persistent macroeconomic shock sets off a large and sudden increase in trend in‡ation, backward-looking becomes more rational than it appears for two reasons. First, the high and volatile in‡ation makes it relatively easier for firms to infer that macroeconomic uncertainty has risen dramatically, and hence the cost of being forward-looking has become prohibitively high. Second, the substantially higher inflation persistence relative to the evolving trend justifies the benefit of backward-looking price setting to a non-trivial extent. Similar results are found across post-WWII U.S. macroeconomic regimes known as the Great Inflation, the Great Moderation, and the Great Recession. When we impose a continuous evolving trend&nbsp;</span><span>inflation across the entire sample in estimation, the median estimates of firm pricing parameters do not seem to display structural breaks and imply a structurally stable NKPC. The data, however, supports the hypothesis of jump discontinuity in evolving trend in‡ation. Moreover, the forecasting power of the CS08 model is investigated for both continuous and discontinuous trend in‡ation. We first calculate the one-step-ahead inflation forecast for the whole sample based on the continuous trend inflation, based on the median as well as the mean. Then we further investigate the one-step-ahead forecasts in subsamples formed with both oil price shock dates and macroeconomic regime switching dates for which discontinuous trend inflation has been imposed. Some subsamples produce larger RMSEs compared to the whole sample, but on average, it seems that imposing a discontinuous trend inflation produces one-step-ahead forecasts that are almost as good as those produced by the whole sample. To make a general statement, however, we need to look at longer-horizon forecasts.</span>\n<br>"}}

That's the vision of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a fast-growing area of finance that is built on blockchain and smart contracts. This paper discusses how lending sites like Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO work, and why clients from ordinary savers looking for high returns to institutions seeking clout are joining. We delve into the technology behind smart contracts, how they deal with risk using over-collateralization, and what motivates people to lend or borrow under this trustless system. But DeFi is not just a tech story-it's social too. It has the potential to disrupt traditional finance, open up access in underserved communities, and put a strain on global regulatory systems. But challenges of scalability, security, and restricting usage to crypto holders only also raise underlying questions. Drawing on a mix of on-chain data and user case studies, this paper further applies resilience theory to discover how DeFi responds to economic shocks compared to traditional banks. By doing so, it fills a key research gap in terms of the long-term economic contribution of DeFi. We offer policy proposals like undercollateralized lending programs and single point regulation, and argue that DeFi, if carefully constructed, can support goals like decent work and economic growth (UN SDG 8). There needs to be future work on what drives take-up and how DeFi could scale across blockchains and geographies to realize its potential."}}

Financial stability is measured using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based Financial Stability Index (FSI) that integrates multiple indicators, including non-performing loan ratios, sovereign bond spreads, stock market volatility, foreign exchange volatility, external debt levels, and current account balances. The empirical framework employs panel data techniques, including fixedeffects and random-effects regressions, with robust standard errors to account for heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence. The independent variables encompass macroeconomic fundamentals (GDP growth, inflation, trade openness, external balances, and foreign reserves), policy indicators (central bank policy rates, asset quality measures), and geopolitical factors (Economic Policy Uncertainty, Geopolitical Risk Index, and sanctions). Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and panel unit-root tests are conducted prior to estimation to ensure data quality and stationarity. Preliminary results indicate that stronger GDP growth, higher foreign reserves, and current account surpluses are positively associated with financial stability, while elevated inflation, non-performing loan ratios, and market volatility exert destabilizing effects. Geopolitical risk and sanctions are found to significantly undermine stability, with effects more pronounced in emerging markets. The study's integrated approach highlights the interplay between economic performance, policy choices, and geopolitical conditions in shaping financial resilience. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to design macroprudential frameworks that safeguard stability amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, and contribute to the literature by combining macroeconomic, policy, and geopolitical determinants in a unified empirical model."}}

To show this, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his portfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his securities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio as with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and variance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities describe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and on the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random volumes of trades with the portfolio. If we assume that all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are constant, obtain Markowitz's equation for the portfolio's random returns.

This study explores the key principles, tools, and challenges in managing digital archives. It analyses data from libraries, archives, and museums, focusing on metadata standards, digital preservation, user access, and content organization. The paper also includes ten analytical tables to illustrate practices, trends, and gaps in digital resource management. The management of digital archives and media resources is increasingly vital as institutions transition from traditional physical collections to complex digital ecosystems. This study examines current practices, challenges, and emerging trends in digital archive management, focusing on preservation strategies, metadata standards, user access features, and technological infrastructure. Using quantitative data and literature analysis, the research highlights prevalent adoption of metadata frameworks like Dublin Core and preservation techniques such as bitlevel backup and format migration. The study also reveals gaps in mobile access, media playback, and the implementation of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence for metadata enhancement. Key challenges identified include budget constraints, obsolete formats, copyright issues, and the need for skilled personnel. Collaboration among academic institutions, government bodies, and community organizations emerges as a crucial factor for sustainable digital preservation. This paper provides actionable insights for institutions aiming to develop resilient, accessible, and user-centered digital archives that balance innovation with long-term preservation needs."}}

This work explicitly quantifies trade barrier probability using an ensemble of several machine learning classifiers, with probability estimates informed by exogenous variables such as prior trade barrier implementation and global export dominance. Major differences in the high-probability countries and commodities are observed across models, but the ensemble method highlights Indonesia, China, Tanzania, and the United States as particularly high risk.

I find that round outcomes obey a clear hierarchy (decisive, high-impact actions carry the most weight), but consistency hinges on judging panel composition. Panels that include officials with weaker links to the sport's core training and assignment pipeline exhibit meaningfully lower agreement; panels drawn from a shared, professionalized training environment agree more, and agreement further rises without crowd pressure. Disputes cluster in inherently ambiguous sequences, not because criteria are unknowable, but because interpretation varies across panel mixes. At the bout level, mis-scorings exist yet are not systematically tied to panel mix. Internal and external validity implications are direct: panel reliability depends less on calibrated composition: minimum experience thresholds, shared training and recertification, transparent selection, structured feedback, and, for high-stakes cases, larger panels or consensus protocols."}}

We first employ emerging hotspot analysis to demonstrate the spatio-temporal trend of residential upzoning in Southern California over the last decade, finding they cluster near popular migration destinations. We then use fixed-effects models and instrumental variable approach to quantify the impacts of upzoning on populations. Our results show that upzoning did not increases total population. Instead, cities with more upzoning experienced significant increases in young college graduates and decreases in non-white population. These demographic shifts coincided with the development of new multi-family housing.

Most of these IPOs showed significant underpricing-a process of fixing the offer price less than the anticipated market-clearing price-resulting in huge first-day appreciation for investors. Although underpricing would seem to be harmful to issuers, theory in signalling explains that good-quality firms would underprice for the purpose of signalling their quality credibly in asymmetric information markets. Using a Bayesian signalling game framework, this paper models IPO underpricing. Issuers are classified as high-or low-quality based on unobservable fundamentals. While low-quality issuers are discouraged by the expense of imitating such a strategy, high-quality issuers may strategically underprice in anticipation of long-term reputational benefits and improved aftermarket performance. Data on offer prices, listing prices, underpricing percentages, and post-listing returns from Indian startup initial public offerings (IPOs) from 2020 to 2024 are used to test the model.

Five interesting patterns emerge: First, officials enjoy significant advantages relative to ordinary households; the wealth growth rates of officials' households are higher by 2.7% per year. Second, the gap between officials' and ordinary households has expanded in recent years. Third, judiciary officials (without access to profitable information) enjoy as much advantages as the executive officials (with such access).

We calculate a risk based fair market value of the servicing fee at the loan level and document the wedge between the fair market value and the actual servicing fee.

Building on the signaturepricing framework of Bayer et al. (2025), we add three practical innovations.

Second, we feed these forecasts into a regime switch that chooses either a rough Bergomi or a calibrated Heston simulator, depending on the predicted roughness. Third, we accelerate signature-kernel evaluations with Random Fourier Features (RFF), cutting computational cost while preserving accuracy. Empirical tests on S&amp;P 500 equity-index options reveal that the assumption of persistent roughness is frequently violated, particularly during stable market regimes when H(t) approaches or exceeds 0.5. The proposed hybrid framework provides a flexible structure that adapts to changing volatility roughness, improving performance over fixed-roughness baselines and reducing duality gaps in some regimes. By integrating a dynamic Hurst parameter estimation pipeline with efficient kernel approximations, we propose to enable tractable, real-time pricing of American options in dynamic volatility environments."}}

Unlike black holes, which generate extreme spacetime curvature resulting in matter-energy accretion, gold holes induce an outward curvature that manifests as persistent gravitational wave emission. This outward-directed influence contributes to the large-scale expansion of the universe. The internal structure of gold holes is characterized by spatially varying gravitational field magnitudes, producing anisotropic stressenergy distributions within their vicinity. Such a configuration may account for both the observed uniformity and acceleration in cosmic expansion, offering a complementary mechanism to dark energy models. Analytical treatment of the gold hole metric suggests that the expansion rate H(t) may be modulated locally by gold hole density, leading to testable predictions for large-scale structure surveys."}}

Municipalities privately observe their fiscal need type, choose effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a statutory threshold. Under convexity and single crossing, the problem reduces to one dimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal ex ante rule is threshold-cap; under discretionary rescue at t = 2, it becomes threshold-linear-cap. A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no bailout regime, and an explicit discount factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible. We emphasize a class of monotone threshold signal rules; under this class, grant crowd out is null almost everywhere, which justifies the constant grant weight used in closed form expressions. The closed form characterization provides a policy template that maps to Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future calibration."}}

The experiment, conducted over two semesters starting in spring 2019, was terminated in spring 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to expectations and existing literature, increased parental information was correlated with lower test scores. The explanation lies in \"upward belief bias\", where parents overestimate their children's behavior. Although school information corrected these beliefs, negatively surprised parents responded with increased involvement, such as punishments or rewards for money and playtime, which proved counterproductive. The findings suggest that excessive parental intervention, particularly in response to negative information, exerts undue pressure on children, harming their academic performance. Overincentivization may not be beneficial for elementary students in China, highlighting the need for balanced parental involvement."}}

While RSI and Dow Theory are widely discussed in trading practice, their combined application under a behavioral finance lens remains largely unexplored in academic literature. We hypothesize that RSI threshold breaches, when concurrent with Dow-confirmed trends, provide earlier and more behaviorally intuitive cues than the conventional RSI 70/30 model. The approach is interpreted through anchoring, herding, and overreaction biases, drawing from behavioral finance theory.

Yet, its potential transmission of political values remains underexplored. This study examines whether the most popular chatbot, ChatGPT, adapts its responses to local democratic values, depending on the language in which it is queried and how these responses compare to human opinions across countries from the World Values Survey (WVS). We develop a novel \"AI Political Index\", quantifying ChatGPT's alignment with local political attitudes. We find that ChatGPT's answers partially adapt to local attitudes, but are liberally biased from 35-60%, depending on the question. For specific dimensions of democracy, ChatGPT presents an almost 100% pro-liberal bias. To investigate to what extent this bias may generalize to all generative AI models, we also carry out the identical analysis for one of ChatGPTs greatest competitors, the Chinese chatbot Deepseek. Interestingly, while the qualitative overall picture at first sight is not fundamentally different for Deepseek, we find some salient differences. While Deepseek displays-if anything-even stronger pro-liberal bias for abstract concepts like \"democracy\", when it comes to specific features of the political system, Deepseek is significantly less weary of having a \"strong leader\" or of army rule. Last but not least, we also study how the political values displayed by chatbots have evolved over the last six months. While overall chatbot answers have proven very stable over this period, for some questions there have been changes, with notably a salient decline in the commitment to democratic elections and gender equality. The findings of the current contribution offer insights into the normative influence of AI technologies, which may become increasingly salient in the context of global democratic backsliding."}}

In signature-based systems, the detection of attacks relies on predefined patterns or behaviours associated with known threats, triggering an alert upon identification of a match. Conversely, anomaly detection systems initiate their process by establishing a baseline profile that reflects the normal operational behaviour of the system or network. These systems possess the capability to identify previously unrecognized attacks, rendering them more effective than their signature-based counterparts. Nevertheless, anomaly-based IDS must consider numerous characteristics when pinpointing attacks Despite these difficulties, machine learning techniques have demonstrated a strong ability to achieve highly accurate anomaly detection and have been employed to identify attacks over the past few decades. Intrusion detection systems are widely used methods to maintain network security. In this paper, the proposed IDS employs machine learning approaches, namely FUZZY are initially applied, followed by optimization algorithms such as Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) to determine the optimal subset of detection features. Comparison study on the performance of the FUZZY and FUZZY-GSA models using KDD dataset with selected optimal 27 total features, shows that the proposed model achieves the highest detection rate with the lowest false alarm rate. The highest detection rate for FUZZY-GSA on the KDD dataset is 98.94% in comparison to other recognition algorithm. In summary, the proposed FUZZY-GSA model attains the highest attack recognition percentage with the lowest false positive rate in KDD dataset."}}

Domain-specific LLMs enhance precision and terminology alignment, RAG enables access to trusted and up-to-date information at inference time, and agentic AI introduces autonomous planning, tool use, and multi-step task execution. The resulting Domain Agent Stack transforms AI from a reactive language model into a proactive, regulation-ready digital collaborator. We illustrate the architecture through use cases in healthcare, legal, and financial sectors, supported by system diagrams and workflow examples.

EDM harness the strength of ABM in capturing social and causal complexity-the heterogeneity of actor beliefs, preferences, behaviors, and the nature of local environments, as well as questions about who interacts with whom, when, where and with what effect. The EDM approach can be used to develop and empirically validate theories that can be generalized beyond the contexts in which they were developed, achieving a high degree of real-world correspondence and providing policy relevant insights. We detail the design and use of EDM for a DfiD-sponsored project that involves forecasting malnutrition at the household level as a result of climate-and conflict-related shocks. Our approach is comprised of six steps: (1) model conceptualization, based on understanding key dynamics-including important causal mechanisms; (2) specification of an ABM that captures these dynamics, albeit parsimoniously; (3) internal validation of the model by means of interaction with domain experts and field work; (4) seeding of the model with relevant empirical data; (5) running simulations and validating model outcomes with empirical data; (6) external validation, or testing the model out-of-sample. Our chapter offers guidance on the EDM development process, from initial model conceptualization based on a research question, to the creation of tools that make research insights accessible to non-technical audiences."}}

Employing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Instrumental Variable (IV) regression techniques, including Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), the analysis reveals that both human capital and social factors have a moderate influence on income over time, with substantial income variability explained by these variables. Findings from the OLS and IV models indicate that returns to education and additional years of work experience have a consistently positive impact on income across both rural and urban areas in the two survey years. However, wage disparities widened significantly in 2016: the gender wage gap increased to 44.1%, the rural-urban gap to 19.4%, and the industrial-service sector gap to 5%, all of which were notably higher than in 2010. Urban males and females earned significantly more than their rural counterparts in both years. The study also highlights a persistent wage advantage in the service sector compared to the agricultural and industrial sectors in 2016. At the same time, the wage differential between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors narrowed, indicating improved wage growth within the agricultural sector. Furthermore, the marginal return to an additional year of education was found to be higher for females than males, underscoring the critical economic value of investing in women’s education. Given that both human capital and social variables play a significant role in shaping income dynamics, strategic policy interventions and targeted investments are essential for addressing wage inequality, reducing socio-economic disparities, and fostering inclusive development in Bangladesh.</span>"}}

Using newly digitized historical population and geographic data combined with modern administrative records, I examine how the violence shaped local economic trajectories, settlement patterns, and demographic composition over seven decades. To address potential endogeneity in the spatial distribution of violence, I employ an instrumental variables approach that exploits the military’s “5 km rule” as an exogenous source of variation in exposure to the massacre. The results reveal persistent disparities between interior and coastal regions: interior areas experienced slower population growth, lower levels of urbanization, and reduced provision of public goods. These effects have endured despite South Korea’s rapid national economic growth, highlighting the long-lasting consequences of geographically targeted violence. The findings suggest that historical conflict can leave deep and enduring scars on regional development."}}

The traditional landowners were forced from their ancestral lands for generations. As many bodies were never recovered, the Māori casualty toll was tentative, and uncertainty remains. The Tarawera eruption narrative is Eurocentric. Māori survivors of the eruption were poorly documented. This transdisciplinary study re-evaluates Māori survivor and media accounts and photography through the lens of Hochstetter's 1859 survey bearings and large-scale mapping. Together with archaeological records, these help establish the coordinates of pre-eruption Māori settlements. Relocating Te Ariki proved key to the analysis, as did Totarariki, Matakana, Tokiniho and Waitangi. Gaps in the historical record exist for Te Rata Bay and Oneroa Bay at Lake Tarawera. These led to recognition of a third mortality cluster of 23 people at an undocumented location. Some families escaped the Red Zone, and at least one undocumented Māori survivor is known to have escaped. Statistical and Time and Distance studies were made to examine the likelihood of survivors escaping the lake settlements before the eruption's base surges overwhelmed the Rotomahana Basin. Many casualties were likely caused by a toxic gas cloud. The research will assist the traditional landowners to relocate settlements, help reconcile casualty estimates and inform as to whether the ancestors' Flight or Freeze decisions were optimal."}}

This paper highlights a notable exception: New Zealand in the 2010s, where labour and multifactor productivity in construction each rose by over 15%. These gains were concentrated in building construction and closely aligned with the timing of widespread zoning reforms permitting medium-and high-density housing in three regions. A simple estimate suggests zoning reform increased Auckland's construction productivity by approximately 8%. I present evidence that upzoning drove productivity through four channels: (a) substantially increased dwellings completed per worker, which more than doubled in Auckland; (b) shifting construction towards higher-productivity regions; (c) increased competition by facilitating a more accessible medium-density construction market; and (d) raising average firm size in residential construction. While other partial explanations for New Zealand's construction productivity boom exist, these complement rather than contradict the role of zoning reform. Zoning reform offers a practical strategy for governments aiming to boost construction productivity."}}

The Trump-era tariffs were broadbased, primarily targeting Chinese imports to address trade imbalances and revive domestic manufacturing. The 2025 Biden tariffs, in contrast, are sector-speciTic, focusing on semiconductors, electric vehicles, and green energy technologies, with the goal of strengthening national security and domestic supply chains. Early evidence suggests that while the 2018-2020 tariffs caused widespread market disruptions and raised consumer prices, the 2025 measures have had a narrower but more strategic impact. This paper contributes to the ongoing policy debate by illustrating how the design and scope of tariff measures shape their economic outcomes."}}

We introduce SpendRight as a philosophical and institutional framework that reframes consumer spending as a form of participatory agencycapable of influencing value distribution, market ethics, and enterprise behavior. To operationalize this vision, we present the Consumer X Power (CXP) model: a decentralized, blockchain-based protocol that returns a share of corporate value directly to consumers based on their spending behavior. Unlike top-down welfare schemes or speculative Web3 incentives, CXP embeds tokenized value return, on-chain governance, and automated accountability into the architecture of commerce itself. More than a redistributive mechanism, CXP creates the structural soil for ethical enterprises to growby transforming consumer loyalty into a source of capital and integrating democratic governance into value flows. This model challenges extractive platform capitalism and offers a regenerative alternative aligned with transparency, cooperation, and shared prosperity. Drawing from institutional economics, platform cooperativism, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), we argue that reclaiming consumption as a civic right is not only ethically urgent but technically feasibleand essential for building inclusive, participatory, and future-resilient economic systems."}}

Departing from traditional views that frame consumption as passive demand, the model reframes consumer behavior as a directional forceone that continuously reshapes market structures through aggregated choices. We formalize this dynamic with the equation: M_{t+1} = M_t + S(C_t, M_t) where M represents the market structure, C denotes consumption behavior, and S is the shaping function that governs how consumption influences structural change over time. This equation is not merely descriptive but normative: it asserts that consumers are not only participants in markets but co-creators of their form. By recognizing consumption as a structural constant, this model lays the groundwork for a participatory economic framework in which market evolution becomes a site of civic agency and value redistribution. The implications extend beyond theory. This paradigm shift enables the design of systemssuch as token-based governance and incentive architectureswhere consumer behavior feeds directly into institutional evolution. In doing so, the model opens a path toward a new kind of economy: one where the power to shape the future is embedded in everyday economic action."}}

An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was employed, involving 200 students in the quantitative phase and 10 purposively selected participants in the qualitative phase. Quantitative data were collected using a validated performance-based assessment, while qualitative insights were obtained through semistructured interviews. Results indicated low proficiency in both macro skills and communicative competence, with a strong, statistically significant positive correlation between the two. Thematic analysis revealed six barriers to macro skill development-limited exposure to authentic language use, fear of errors and judgment, insufficient external learning support, grade-focused rather than communicationfocused instruction, absence of individualized feedback, and digital distractions. Six challenges in communicative competence application were also identified-speaking anxiety, limited vocabulary and retrieval issues, difficulty adapting language to context, weaknesses in active listening and turn-taking, code-switching interference, and lack of real-world practice. The findings highlight the need for pedagogical interventions that create authentic communication opportunities and address emotional, cognitive, and contextual barriers to language acquisition. Future studies should assess targeted strategies to enhance both macro skills and communicative competence in senior high school learners."}}

Traditionally associated with forprofit enterprises, CSR has evolved into an essential framework for non-profits to engage in community support, foster resilience, and enhance stakeholder trust. Using Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this research dissects SHF's CSR communications on Facebook during the pandemic's early months, identifying the narratives of solidarity and caring as key discursive themes. The solidarity discourse underscores collective action, resilience, and the inclusive framing of community challenges, positioning SHF as a pivotal leader in resource reallocation and crisis mitigation. Simultaneously, the caring discourse highlights altruistic commitment through unconditional aid and support for marginalized groups, reflecting ethical CSR principles. These discourses establish SHF's credibility and reinforce its mission to promote unity and sustainability in Malaysian society. The findings demonstrate that CSR communication, when employed strategically, enables non-profits like SHF to build enduring relationships with stakeholders and strengthen communal bonds during crises. This research contributes to the understanding of non-profit CSR strategies by revealing how empathetic, community-centered narratives can enhance both immediate crisis response and long-term social cohesion. The study affirms that CSR can be a transformative tool in non-profit crisis management, emphasizing that well-articulated CSR practices reinforce trust and solidarity, which are essential for resilient societies."}}

This tension is explored through an ontoepistemological framework that recognizes the ontological and epistemic reality of human diversity, both culturally and scientifically. Drawing from legal anthropology, political theory, and comparative historical analysis, the study critiques EU directives and regulations that standardize rather than harmonize, potentially eroding local legal identities and cultural autonomy. The article proposes a \"pluralist customary model\" that preserves diversity while maintaining universal principles, arguing that true universalism must accommodate the multiplicity of human social orders rather than enforce a singular normative pattern."}}

Given the construction sector's significance to a nation's economy, it is imperative to investigate and analyze diverse risk identification and management solutions. This paper presents a methodology developed through a real-time case study to assess risk in building projects. Risk can be described as determining the probability, intensity, and exposure of all hazards related to a building phase. The research advocates for a combined approach for risk evaluation in building projects utilizing RA and the Geological Information System (GIS) for decision-making. The research identifies various hazards in building projects via the study of the literature research and the formulation of surveys. The suggested study documents the replies from diverse building projects to the specified surveys. The findings of the proposed study identify the primary hazards in building projects. The research advocates for a comprehensive spatial risk evaluation and a GIS-based approach for diverse building projects."}}

As different obligors usually operate in common economic environments, such structural asset value correlations (\"AVCs\") are the main reason why regulatory capital is needed, and why this is an important component of the regulatory regime for credit risk capital. Basel has set a range for corporate asset correlations from 8 to 24%, the exact value depending on several individual firm characteristics. We address a relatively neglected aspect in the empirical literature, the effect of maturity or the term structure of AVCs. We utilize over 30 years of default rate data from S&amp;P, quarterly cohorts and default horizons of up to 25 years, to calculate term structures of asset correlations by credit rating and compare these with Basel II as well as results from other papers. Our results are in line with literature, but a clear difference is found between the majority of these results and the results from Basel II and some major software providers, as we find that the relationship with the asset correlation generally increases with PD ratings of declining credit quality, where depending on the default horizon we observe non-monotonic increases.

However, real-world signals frequently exhibit heavy-tailed, impulsive, or otherwise non-Gaussian noise that can severely degrade its performance. To address this, various extensions have been proposed, including ensemble and particle filters, as well as parametric models like the Student&apos;s t and Gaussian mixture models. While these methods improve robustness, they often depend on prior knowledge of the noise distribution or entail high computational costs. Recently, Information Theoretic Learning (ITL) criteria, such as the Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC) and Minimum Error Entropy (MEE), have shown strong potential by capturing higher-order error statistics, thereby improving robustness to outliers and non-Gaussian disturbances. Nonetheless, MEE-based filters remain sensitive to kernel size selection, which can affect convergence and accuracy.This work introduces a novel framework, the M-Estimation Enhanced Minimum Error Entropy Kalman Filter (MMEEKF), which integrates MEE-based filtering with robust regression via M-estimators. This integration improves accuracy under non-Gaussian noise while maintaining computational efficiency. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that MMEEKF achieves better accuracy and stability across diverse noise environments."}}

This follow-up study aimed to identify lifetime factors associated with employment and family formation among former foster care minors in their late 20s, using logistic regression analysis. The study population included all individuals born between 1991 and 1994 in Finland who had a history of out-of-home care during childhood (n = 12 499). After adjusting for other factors, the most important predictors of employment were having a higher education degree (OR 11,586 , 95 % CI 9,088—14,771), upper secondary education (OR 4,753, 95% CI 4,375—5,162), no need of specialized care for autism spectrum disorders both in 18—28 years of age (OR 2,261, 95% CI (1,458—3,508) and during childhood (OR 1,741, 95% CI 1,193—2,541). Employed alumni were more likely to be in a partnership with or without children compared to those who were unemployed, studying, having disability pension or otherwise outside the labor force. Individuals on disability pension with out-of-home care history had the highest need for psychiatric care in young adulthood. In conclusion educational attainment and the absence of serious mental health problems were key protective factors for employment and romantic relationships among foster care alumni in young adulthood."}}

Prepared in alignment with the Forest and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan (1995), its Rules and Regulations (2017), and the LFMP manual, the plan addresses the need for regulated rural timber and firewood supply. Forest resource assessments conducted from April to June 2017 evaluated forest types, conditions, site characteristics, accessibility, and socio-economic dependencies. The hardwood-dominated forests exhibit generally good (57%) to average (31%) condition, with an average standing volume of 164 m³/ha and basal area of 16.4 m²/ha. Sustainable Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) is set at 2,817 m³, ensuring wood availability over an estimated 105-year rotation. The plan incorporates multiple forest uses—timber extraction (47%), firewood collection (27%), and restoration interventions (15%)—while safeguarding steep slopes, riparian buffers, and inaccessible zones. Non-wood forest products, particularly bamboo and cane, are locally significant, and grazing occurs intensively in 48% of the management area. Socio-economic assessments reveal 179 households across three villages relying primarily on agriculture, with cardamom as a key cash crop. Demand–supply analyses indicate that both timber and firewood requirements can be met sustainably within the plan period. Monitoring provisions emphasize strict compliance with tree marking, regulated rural timber allocation, and adherence to conservation rules. This LFMP demonstrates a model for balancing rural livelihood needs with ecological integrity in Bhutan’s protected areas."}}

This mitigates the welfare losses typically associated with unilaterally increasing environmental stringency. The model is calibrated using detailed Indian firm-level data on emissions, productivity, and export performance. We estimate that the relative welfare loss of raising Indian carbon pricing to the level of the European Union (EU) is 52% lower as compared to a scenario without a BCA. When additionally accounting for environmental disutility, the analysis shows that the existence of a BCA increases India's welfare-optimal emissions tax under low and moderate social cost of carbon (SCC) scenarios. In contrast, the presence of a BCA can reduce the welfare-optimal tax in settings of very high SCCs."}}

This study investigates how ethical perception, intelligibility, accountability, social acceptance, and strategic AI utilization collectively influence the effectiveness of AI-based HRM decision making. Drawing on socio technical theory and normative ethical climate theory, the research examines whether organizational ethical climate acts as a contextual amplifier or constraint in these relationships. Instead of treating ethics and technology as separate domains, this work frames them as interdependent forces within HR systems. The study contributes to ongoing discussions about algorithmic trust, perceived legitimacy, and the strategic embedding of AI in people management practices.

While traditional economic indicators often lag actual conditions, our analysis-through both synthetic modeling and empirical validation-demonstrates that measurable shifts in consumer behavior, including fashion trends, substance use, shopping preferences, dietary choices, financial decisions, and social patterns, consistently precede official recession declarations by 6 to 36 months. Data Integration and Validation Framework: We employ a dual-method approach, first developing synthetic behavioral indicators using extensive longitudinal data from government agencies, industry reports, and academic surveys, then validating these indicators against real-time FRED and BLS data spanning 1929-2025. Validation results show that synthetic behavioral indicators achieve 87-94% accuracy compared to actual economic data, with especially strong performance for financial stress indicators (R² = 0.91), consumer adaptation patterns (R² = 0.89), and employment-related behavioral changes (R² = 0.86). Enhanced Empirical Findings: Drawing from validated datasets including the FRED database, BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey, NHANES, and over 50 additional government and industry sources, we analyze behavioral indicators across twelve primary domains. Results confirm that financial stress measures-such as 401(k) loan activity, hardship withdrawals, and credit application patterns-provide 12-18 month advance warning of downturns with 94.2% accuracy. Consumer adaptation behaviors, validated through BLS expenditure data, show systematic shifts toward value-oriented purchasing 6-9 months before official recession recognition."}}

While each community endows its principal holidays with gift-giving rituals and conspicuous displays of wealth, the sole differentiator among regions is the precise timing of these festivities on the Gregorian calendar. Our central thesis is that gold, owing to its dual role as a universal wealth reservoir and socio-cultural status symbol, experiences concentrated, holiday-induced buying pressure that yields persistent and economically material drift in the GLD ETF. By quantifying this effect across four distinct cultural calendars, we introduce a previously undocumented demand-side factor into commodity-pricing models."}}

Such testing indicts programmes such as Ghana's Free Senior High School (SHS) policy and India's Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, which successfully increased access 34 per cent enrolment gains in Ghana, 25 per cent literacy gains in India but suffered from implementation deficits including overcrowded classrooms, teacher shortages and unequal distribution of resources. Finland's equity-oriented system, with an emphasis on teacher autonomy and digital inclusion, contributed to small urban-rural differences in academic achievement (&lt; 5%), but persistent gender disparities in STEM fields. Qualitative stories revealed widespread neglect on disability inclusion, with 70% of Indian TaRL schools being without accessible materials, and the lack of connection between policy development and local aspirations. Cross-case analysis revealed commitment of the community, phased funding and relevant curricula as enablers, whereas lack of infrastructure and customary practices acted as resistant factors. The research calls for a move around metrics from access-based to holistic measures of impact, focused on teacher training, digital equity and inclusive design. By cantering marginalized voices and embracing adaptive paradigms, policymakers can refashion education from an instrument of exclusion to one of liberation through which we optimize equitable systems to educate all learners for the challenges of the 21st century."}}

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and its revised versions – namely UTAUT, UTAUT-2, and UTAUT-3 – have been applied by some researchers to determine if people are prepared to use new technologies and whether they want to do so in the future. However, the importance of Digital Literacy (DL) has not been considered in these models. Studies have shown that the DL of tourists is a key element for the success of digital transformation in the tourism context. On one hand, if a tourist does not have basic skills in using digitalised facilities, they will not obtain the advantages offered by the organisation. On the other hand, a digitally illiterate tourist might consider digitalised facilities as unnecessary burdens to enjoy their travel. This study develops a conceptual model of technology acceptance that incorporates DL to determine the impact of tourists’ acceptance of digital technology on their ‘level’ of customer satisfaction.

It concludes that while New York’s law streamlines enforcement and licensing, its greatest impact may lie in estate administration and taxation, offering lessons for jurisdictions still lacking such a right.</p>"}}

In reality, these arrangements act as a dual tax on U.S. households-once through import tariffs and again through upward pressure on domestic energy prices caused by expanded exports. Using household-level models for California's PG&amp;E service area, combined with U.S. Department of Energy export elasticity data, this paper estimates that plausible scenarios could raise annual residential energy costs by $350-$650 before accounting for transportation fuel impacts. When gasoline and diesel price effects are included, total annual household burdens can reach $500-$850. The export chain itself consumes 10-20% of liquefied natural gas (LNG) energy content, accelerating drawdown of finite reserves. These policies also risk compromising long-term energy security by hastening the need for imports, imposing higher costs on future generations. The emerging growth in artificial intelligence (AI) and data center electricity demand-projected to reach 200-250 TWh annually by 2030-compounds these challenges, as export-driven energy losses could otherwise power all projected AI needs several times over. Coupled with the oil and gas industry's more than $130 million in federal lobbying expenditures in 2023, these trends raise fundamental questions about national interest, economic equity, intergenerational responsibility, and strategic energy allocation."}}

Using LEHD data I find that the average skill of the college workforce declined by 16% between 2002 and 2019, consistent with lower skill for marginal college graduates over time. Average skill for non-college workers changed little. I estimate that growth in the college wage gap would have been four times greater absent changes in skill composition. Through the lens of a supply and demand model, the college wage gap continues to rise despite narrowing skill differences because college workers sort to firms with much faster relative growth in labor demand."}}

The authors explore these facets through a case study of uncertainty, that of unexpected monsoon floods in 2018 and 2019 in Wayanad, a peri-urban hill district in Kerala, India. Through the case, they show that compounded uncertainty leads to ambiguity in action, but that this ambiguity can be ameliorated by a contextualised contingency planning approach.

It acknowledges that the patent system is an imperfect incentive for innovation, but that patent protection is necessary for research and development. Developed countries have consistently objected to attempts by developing countries to address patents in international treaties, most recently the Paris Agreement. As such, this paper will propose an Incentivised Licensing approach that would require governments to grant tax deductions to companies that enter into green technology licensing deals with developing countries. This approach recognises the role that patents play in technology transfer and places an obligation on governments to actively encourage green technology transfer. Furthermore, governments of developing countries will be able to access the Green Climate Fund to ensure that licensors are adequately remunerated for their technology. This solution strikes a balance between the needs of companies to recoup investment, the desire of developed countries to maintain strong patent rights, and the ability of developing countries to access technology transfer to achieve a Just Transition."}}

Changes in payment methods, new forms of virtual assets, and the declining usage of cash could affect the future role of central banks and their ability to achieve their policy objectives, such as ensuring efficient payment systems and effective interest rate transmission. CBDCs can address such concerns by offering a new form of digital money that can better cater to the requirements of an increasingly digital economy while upholding public confidence in the national currency. The Digital Dirham will be fully integrated in the payment system with legal tender status, enabling instant settlements and widespread accessibility as a secure, trusted and convenient form of traditional central bank money.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n The Digital Dirham offers significant benefits. It can enhance payment system efficiency, increase monetary policy effectiveness, and enable new digital economy applications. A widely accessible Digital Dirham also expands access to financial services for unbanked or underbanked individuals, ensuring equitable distribution of digitalisation benefits and serving as key channel for remittance flows. In addition, the Digital Dirham can boost the UAE’s position as a regional financial centre by offering innovative payment services as digital technologies progress.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Key policy principles and design features will mitigate potential risks, including by preserving bank-based financial intermediation. Like any other CBDC, the Digital Dirham could present risks to financial and monetary stability as well as challenges related to privacy, cybersecurity, and illicit activity. Various key design features, including an intermediated two-tier distribution model (in collaboration with licensed financial institutions) and wallet-based access, will be incorporated. Appropriate limits and non-remuneration will ensure - from a policy perspective - that the Digital Dirham is used primarily as a means of payment (while the bulk of deposits and savings continues to be held at banks and other financial institutions). “Pseudonymity” will help safeguard privacy but include digital identity/KYC protocols and payment traceability to deter its misuse for illicit purposes.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n In 2023, the CBUAE initiated the first phase of Digital Dirham implementation by establishing a robust and comprehensive legal and policy framework to support the issuance of CBDC as legal tender. The CBUAE has already carried out a real-value retail pilot to evaluate the future design, technology and advantages of the Digital Dirham and developed four digital economy use cases to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the Digital Dirham as a novel payment method, which – in its planned configuration – can open up new business models and spur financial innovation through flexible interoperability, accessibility, and programmability. The CBUAE is now able to issue and distribute the Digital Dirham to LFIs having built a customised issuance platform that utilises distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n The Digital Dirham will be introduced in a phased approach for retail, wholesale, and cross-border transactions. In early 2024, the CBUAE completed its first issuance of the Digital Dirham in the context of a cross-border transaction as part of Project mBridge. Project mBridge is the world’s first operational multi-CBDC platform, facilitating efficient, cost-effective, and instant cross-border payment and settlement in central bank money. In the coming years, the CBUAE – in partnership with relevant government entities and industry stakeholders – will advance preparations for the full launch of both the retail and wholesale versions of the Digital Dirham using a cautious, flexible and collaborative approach. A graduated and controlled rollout of the Digital Dirham aligns with CBDC initiatives in other countries and allows for ongoing monitoring of global CBDC developments, enabling the identification of emerging insights and lessons learned.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n This paper examines the key policy considerations and design aspects that have shaped the development of the Digital Dirham. It also provides an overview of how the CBUAE considered relevant costs and benefits and implemented necessary measures to mitigate potential risks. In addition, the paper explains the CBUAE’s policy principles that have guided the design and governance of the Digital Dirham. It concludes with an update on the current progress in creating the operational model and provides a brief outlook on the next steps needed before the official launch of the Digital Dirham.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>"}}

The immediate, but not exclusive, application is electricity markets. We construct an equilibrium in which the incumbents cooperate to prevent storage from operating, even absent entry costs. The producers achieve cooperation through the threat of Nash reversion and preempt operation of the storage unit with the threat to cycle between high purchase prices and low selling prices. Because two kinds of deviations must be deterred, the equilibrium requires a two-sided condition on the discount factor. Market power is essential to the result, which fits a strategic environment, as is the need of storage to first buy. Combined, these characteristics allow other players to determine the marginal cost of storage."}}

Additionally, empirical insights from diverse contexts are necessary to gain a nuanced understanding of the ageing-in-place debate. To shed light on the global challenges of gender and ageing disparities, this chapter uses intersectionality as a theoretical lens to analyse current urban planning policies and practices. By examining case studies from both the Global North and Global South, it discusses how intersectionality can inform efforts to mainstream gender and ageing in urban planning. Furthermore, this chapter underscores the interdependencies between intersectionality and gender mainstreaming and how they can facilitate age- and gender-appropriate planning and design strategies. While promising initiatives to address ageing in place have emerged in some cities and countries, planning policies and city-building practices in many developmental contexts still perpetuate patriarchal social norms. Therefore, systemic consideration is needed to create holistic and inclusive urban environments. Ultimately, this chapter argues that applying an intersectional lens to gender mainstreaming in urban planning can prioritise the ethics of care and create age-friendly environments.</span>"}}

As a result, Caribbean youth often experience unequal treatment within the legal system, leading to disproportionately high rates of incarceration, recidivism, and social exclusion. These legal shortcomings also contribute to broader societal challenges such as gang involvement, exposure to violence, and limited access to quality education and opportunity. Using a post-colonial point of view, this paper critically analyzes the structural failures of Caribbean justice systems inherited from Western colonial rule, and proposes culturally responsive reforms aimed at youth rehabilitation and empowerment."}}

To build pre-existing infrastructure-less networks for process monitoring and control in industries like transportation, energy, smart structures, environment observing, healthcare, security, industrial, and manufacturing, all the wireless sensors are now integrated into the MANET ecosystem. MANET nodes' long-term operations must be taken into account for designing purposes. Historically, batteries have been a common source of power for wireless devices, which are a major chunk of MANET components. While this has led to lower overall system costs, it can hurt the lifetime and general recital of the network in which they are employed. Various routing-based protocols are proposed for extending the lifespan of these sensor networks, and in certain situations doing away with the need for batteries entirely. Furthermore, energy harvesting provides practical and financial benefits by optimizing energy use and lowering network maintenance expenses. This research explores current developments in MANET energy harvesting methods along with a few research issues that need to be resolved in the future to facilitate the widespread use of energy harvesting technologies in MANET."}}

The MANET is an obvious solution to the anytime, anywhere network in the age of heterogeneous networks. All mobile gadgets wirelessly communicate and organize themselves. The Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) is a severe danger to the security and communication of the mobile node in a MANET. However, with the time network, defenses against these attacks became more lackluster, and network infrastructure grew stronger with time. Additionally, they make use of valid application layer requests, which in turn creates a challenging environment for defense systems in place to identify them. DDoS attacks have recently begun targeting web applications to create disturbance in user service. Finding distinctive characteristics for DDoS attack detection with a high classification accuracy to label the user as either valid or illegal depending on selected attributes is proposed in this work. The results of the suggested model can be tested in terms of assessment parameters."}}

The number of female children in the household is used as an instrumental variable to address endogeneity concerns. The findings show that a larger family size negatively impacts labour market performance, raising unemployment and lowering employment rates. While family size is positively associated with holding formal or managerial/professional jobs, it significantly reduces hourly wages, weekly working hours, and monthly earnings. No significant effects are found for public or private sector employment. Subgroup analysis reveals that the negative impacts are more pronounced among individuals with lower education levels and in regions outside Amman, suggesting regional disparities in labour market access and structure."}}

This paper uses a recently-constructed dataset on the fiscal history of African countries from 1900 to 2015 to analyze the impact of decolonization on fiscal capacity (defined as revenue from taxes that are relatively difficult to collect and that require more administrative infrastructure). The analysis adopts a staggered difference-indifference approach, implemented using a stacked event study. It finds no discernible pre-trends prior to decolonization, and a substantial increase in fiscal capacity starting about 5-6 years after decolonization. This result-which implies substantial state-building activity in postcolonial Africa-is robust to tests for a variety of alternative explanations, the use of alternative control groups, and the use of generalized synthetic control methods. We also show that this effect is not explained by democratization or improved public goods provision. Our conceptual framework instead posits that post-colonial states were able to increase tax revenues from hard-to-collect sources because their higher degree of legitimacy improved citizens' tax morale. We offer historical evidence that is consistent with this channel. Our finding-that colonial rulers invested less in fiscal capacity than did post-independence governments-sheds new light on the consequences of colonial rule, and on the determinants of variation in governments' fiscal capacity."}}

Using euro area data spanning 1999Q1 to 2024Q4, we estimate and simulate the non-linear model. We then study the recent inflation surge and the implications of state-dependent prices and wages for monetary policy in the estimated non-linear model. Unlike conventional models, our framework does not primarily explain inflation dynamics by exogenous supply shocks. Instead, the impact of shocks on inflation depends on their timing, size, and the business cycle. Consequently, the inflation-output stabilization trade-off faced by monetary policy is state-dependent. For example, monetary policy is more effective in curbing inflation, and supply shocks have larger effects during periods of high inflation."}}

This paper incorporates anonymity into the canonical non-cooperative connections model (Bala and Goyal (2000)) to explore symmetric, mixed-strategy equilibria in network formation. We show that, for any trembling-hand perfect equilibrium, strategies can be interpreted as socialization effort and yield a random network, closely related to but distinct from classical Erdős-Rényi graphs. This provides a strategic microfoundation for random graphs. We fully characterize these equilibria and efficient networks for large populations as a function of connection costs."}}

Using Indonesia and Malaysia as regional comparators and equity indices (S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones) as global economic controls, the analysis reveals a statistically significant decline in GDP levels, growth rates, and educational attainment during the post-Martial Law period. The GDP fell short by approximately 3%, GDP growth lagged by 1.63 percentage points annually, and gross enrollment was 2 percentage points lower relative to the counterfactual. Results suggest that Martial Law induced long-term economic costs, stunting development and undermining education. These findings challenge the narrative of a \"golden age\" under authoritarian rule and underscore the importance of evidence-based evaluation of unconventional policy regimes in developing economies."}}

However, literature would suggest that fiscal and monetary shocks would significantly increase unemployment whereas an improvement in job-matching would allow hard-to-fill occupations to find qualified applicants. Thus, this research simulates shocks of matching technology processes, government spending through unemployment benefits and subsidies, and monetary policies on labor market dynamics in the Philippine economy both empirically and theoretically. Building on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models of previous literatures (McNelis, 2009; Monacelli, 2010; Tan, 2015; and Zhang, 2015), the research employs a New Keynesian DSGE model of labor markets with search frictions that estimates the impact of advanced matching technology, expansionary fiscal and monetary policies on output and unemployment. Calibration is used to match certain elements of the Philippine economy. Results from the calibrated baseline model show that the matching process, expansionary fiscal and monetary shocks all lead to an expansion in output and an increase in vacancies, translating to a decline in the unemployment rate. Overall, the fiscal shock exhibits more persistent effects on both the economy and the labor market compared to the monetary and matching process shocks, although both fiscal and monetary effects on output and unemployment are short-lived. A policy mix would generate the best results as a simultaneous matching, fiscal, and monetary shock would decrease unemployment and increase output the most. The results of the simulations in the calibrated model allow us to develop policies that are effective in carrying out the short-term and long-term objectives of the Philippine authorities."}}

This \"inflation tax,\" implemented through domestic credit creation, allows for a systemic transfer of value from international U.S. dollar holders to domestic recipients.

In addition, Bamboo plays an indispensable role in various ethnic rituals and cultural festivals of the Karbi tribe namely Chujoon, Rongker, Karbi Youth Festival, etc. However, bamboo sale and marketability has reduced over the years. Shutting down of paper mills is one of the major reasons towards less involvement in Bamboo farming and management. Illegal trading and third-party exploitation were also reported in the bamboo supply-chain."}}

The qualitative methodology adopted included triangulation of methods with documentary research of official reports (2021-2024), semi-structured interviews with the national coordination, and questionnaires applied to local coordinators, students, and taxpayers served by the centers. The main results highlight as strengths the solid institutional partnership between the Federal Revenue Service and HEIs, which maintains 493 active centers, and the successful integration of theory and practice, with 345,869 cases handled annually. However, the study identified significant weaknesses, such as excessive dependence on student volunteer work and the geographical concentration of services in a few regions. Among the opportunities, we highlight the increase in demand for accounting services for Individual Microentrepreneurs (28% growth in three years) and the inclusion of tax education in the National Common Core Curriculum. On the other hand, threats such as the financial instability of partner institutions and deficiencies in post-pandemic technological infrastructure may compromise the future sustainability of the project. The study offers important strategic and theoretical contributions, highlighting objective guidelines for expanding the social impact and operational and financial sustainability of NAF at the national level."}}

This book chapter explores advanced blockchain-enabled mechanisms, including Layer 2 scaling solutions, cross-chain communication, and AI-driven smart contract optimization, to enhance the efficiency of energy trading networks. The role of blockchain in managing renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon credits was also examined, highlighting tokenization as a means to improve market liquidity, transparency, and regulatory compliance. Additionally, a comparative analysis of consensus mechanisms and throughput optimization techniques was provided, offering insights into the trade-offs between security and scalability. The integration of AI and machine learning in smart contracts was discussed as a key enabler for predictive energy trading, automated market adjustments, and fraud detection. Future research directions focus on hybrid blockchain models, cross-chain interoperability, and sustainable energy tokenization frameworks. The findings of this chapter contribute to the development of a highly efficient, decentralized, and resilient smart power ecosystem, paving the way for the next generation of blockchain-based energy markets.</span>"}}

Moreover, our model explicitly incorporates the interaction between biological and subjective age, as documented in empirical studies (e.g., Stephan et al., 2015). It replicates key findings from the literature, such as the observation that biological age can differ up to 20 years from the chronological age (Bortz et al., 2023), or that people older than 40 believe to be 20% younger (Rubin and Berntsen, 2006). To facilitate economic applications, we develop a three-state lifecycle model in which transition probabilities are determined by biological and subjective age, respectively. As an illustration, we apply the framework to a consumption and portfolio choice problem, where health-dependent utility functions are applied."}}

India is home to nearly 45% of global bamboo patches and Northeastern Region (NER) comprises of two-thirds of the total growing stock of the country. However, there has been a lot of challenges and loopholes identified in terms of availability of consistent and accurate data on different aspects of bamboo such as area coverage, productivity, carbon sequestration, feedstock, consumption &amp; livelihood. Earth observation data has been proved to be highly instrumental and successful towards spatial mapping of natural resources, including bamboo ecosystems. The present study aimed at delineating &amp; analyzing the bamboo groves of Karbi-Anglong district of Assam using geospatial technologies. Random Forest Classifier technique was adopted for supervised classification in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using the necessary scripts and codes. Bamboo Index (BI) for the study area was computed by incorporating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Stress Index (SI). Results of the research work revealed that bamboo patches in the study area had BI values ranging from 0.42 to 0.49. Furthermore, majority of the area was observed to be occupied by the forests (Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests &amp; Tropical Semi-Evergreen Forests) followed by Bamboo groves, Agriculture, Fallow Land, Barren Land, Waterbodies and Built-up areas. The findings were instrumental in contributing to the ambit of information on the Bamboo Groves of Karbi-Anglong District, Assam. This could prove to be vital in creation of a reliable database for monitoring and management of one of the most essential renewable Non-Timber Forest Resources considered as 'green gold' and 'poor man's timber' thereby contributing towards elimination of few of the gaps and challenges which has direct implications on the growth and development of the bamboo sector in Northeastern region."}}

Consequently, poverty alleviation efforts have largely focused on raising incomes through grants, subsidies and other financial interventions. Non-profit and religious organisations supplement these efforts, often reducing the suffering and sustaining life. However, such approaches do little to cure poverty, contributing instead to its persistence. Income, rather than being the root cause, is a symptom of a broader issue. Other symptoms, such as elevated crime rates, road fatalities, teenage pregnancies, certain health conditions, fragile relationships, and poor educational outcomes, frequently accompany poverty. This paper argues that poverty stems from behavioural patterns transmitted intergenerationally, primarily through parenting. These behaviours are shaped by chronic stress during childhood, an epigenetic process that programs individuals for the environment they are expected to inhabit. Addressing poverty, therefore, requires strengthening pair bonding (the foundation of effective parenting), educating caregivers on the importance of parenting, and providing mechanisms to alleviate stress and trauma frequently found in disadvantaged communities. Given the constraints on financial and professional resources, such interventions must be community-driven."}}

For capital providers, particularly those classified as retail investors or pension fund holders, the links between biodiversity loss and how their capital is allocated may be difficult to discern. A broad variety of investment vehicles are available to non-professional, individual investors. The largest proportion of investment capital is directed towards those vehicles that are passively managed and as far as possible reduce transaction costs for capital providers while offering easily defined expected returns and risk over a defined future time-period. While these investment vehicles and associated systems that direct capital providers are efficient from a financial perspective, they have effects on transparency and investor agency over how their capital is deployed. The protocol described here outlines the methodology for a systematic review to explore how individual investors can more effectively allocate their capital to investment vehicles that protect and enhance nature, and the ecosystem services it provides. Our primary research question is: how do individual investors interpret, access and participate in nature-conscious investment? By individual investors we mean non-professional investors who allocate capital in pursuit of financial goals. This includes those who actively manage their long-term savings through pension funds and retail investors who participate in financial markets of their own accord.

This expansion, driven by consumer preferences and aggressive marketing tactics, occurred under a regulatory framework that prioritizes access over safety. Unlike prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements do not require pre-market FDA approval, enabling widespread distribution of products with limited oversight. This paper critically examines the U.S. regularly approach to dietary supplements, contrasting it with that of the E.U., and explores how cognitive biases are routinely exploited to drive sales. The manipulation of consumer preferences and behavior, especially among vulnerable populations, has led to significant public health consequences, including underreported adverse events and increased emergency department visits. Case studies, such as TB12 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and vitamin A promotion during the current U.S. measles outbreak, illustrate the dangers of regulatory gaps and misinformation. The paper concludes with evidence-based policy recommendations to strengthen consumer protections, including enhanced labeling requirements, mandatory adverse event reporting, pre-market product registration, and expanded third party certification.</span></p>"}}

The research employs remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and Python APIs to conduct a longitudinal analysis of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes over two decades (2000-2020). Our findings reveal that Erbil's urban expansion exhibits polycentric, linear, and scattered spatial configurations, influenced by three primary factors: rapid population growth, increasing automobile dependency (demonstrated by a 1,197% increase in vehicle registrations), and accelerated LULC transformations (evidenced by 281% growth in built-up areas). The absence of an integrated master plan and inadequate urban governance mechanisms have contributed substantially to uncontrolled sprawl patterns. This research provides critical insights for urban planners and policymakers in developing regions confronting similar urbanization challenges."}}

Hyman Minsky always emphasized the importance of finance in the capitalist system and described finance as a constantly evolving mechanism that creates inherent stability for the economy. Minsky also proposed policy solutions to mitigate the instability caused by financial innovation and evolution. He considered the institutions within the capitalist system as the most fundamental elements regarding providing stability to the innately unstable system. However, the scope of the empirical literature on the financial instability hypothesis was narrow for a very long time and has recently been growing, specifically after the Global Financial Crisis. There are several fundamental questions: What were the shares of Ponzi, speculative, and hedge firms in an industry in the US economy between 1999 and 2022? What are the determinants of a firm in an industry becoming Ponzi? If they are already, then what is the probability of default? This article attempts to address these research questions via an empirical analysis of the major industries in the United States from the perspective of financial instability hypothesis between 1999 and 2022. The main argument of the article is that the financial fragility of the US economy has been consistently high since the early 2000s leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. However, this article finds some conflicting and some consistent results concerning the financial instability hypothesis."}}

A latent variable for internet and phone dependency was constructed using factor analysis, and a regression model was employed to analyze the relationship between social belonging and dependency, controlling for variables such as gender, age, and socioeconomic status. Contrary to initial hypotheses, the study found no significant relationship between adolescents' perceptions of fitting in and their internet and phone dependency. However, gender was found to be a significant predictor, with female adolescents more likely to exhibit higher levels of dependency compared to males. The study also found that self-imposed screen time restrictions were not reliable indicators of dependency. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing internet and phone dependency should focus on psychological factors such as social anxiety and self-esteem, rather than peer integration. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on adolescent internet dependency and offers practical recommendations for stakeholders, including the need for gender-specific interventions and universal programs that address underlying psychological factors.</p>"}}

Yet how expert-driven dietary guidelines navigate such expansion remains underexplored. This study addresses this knowledge gap by examining the 2023 Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR2023) as a pioneering case of traditional health-focused frameworks broadening to embrace ecological sustainability and procedural transparency. Drawing on theories of framing and legitimacy, this qualitative case study analyses documentary materials and seven in-depth interviews with core NNR experts, capturing their reflective sense-making at the intersection of science, policy, and public participation. Our findings reveal that NNR2023 experts pursued legitimacy through three intertwined strategies: enhancing epistemic legitimacy via interdisciplinary recruitment and systematic evidence review; fostering procedural legitimacy through unprecedented stakeholder openness and transparency; and building cultural legitimacy through principled flexibility that accommodated Nordic food traditions. Yet these expansions generated new tensions. Maintaining scientific authority whilst integrating non-health priorities required careful frame management, whilst procedural transparency paradoxically increased both trust and vulnerability to criticism and political contestation. These findings illuminate the challenges inherent in frame expansion within contemporary governance: legitimacy emerges not as a fixed attribute but as a dynamic negotiation amongst diverse values, interests, and uncertainties. The study advances theoretical understanding of legitimation in food policy whilst offering practical insights for designing robust, contextsensitive dietary governance in an era of heightened expectations for health, sustainability, and democratic engagement."}}

It examines how courts have interpreted and enforced NDAs, and whether they are effective enough to deter misuse or unauthorized disclosure. The study looks at landmark Indian judicial decisions and compares India’s approach to international standards, including those in the U.S., EU, and China. A key focus is the practical challenges in enforcing NDAs, especially in employer-employee settings, where confidentiality is often breached. The research also considers whether relying on NDAs is enough, or if India needs a dedicated trade secret law.

This paper examines the textual structure of climaterelated financial disclosures in the European energy sector, focusing on their alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations on governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The analysis combines four layers: lexicometric diagnostics to assess readability and structure; AI-based BERT models to evaluate alignment; topic modeling to explore thematic organisation; and panel regressions to identify structural, financial, and cultural drivers. Results show that firms prioritize metrics and strategy over governance and risk management. Shorter, focused language improves alignment with risk disclosures, while lexical variety supports governance and strategy. Thematic analysis reveals fragmented climate narratives, suggesting limited maturity in integration. Regression results highlight that board gender diversity, ownership structure, ESG scores, EU taxonomy-aligned revenues, and cultural orientation are key drivers of TCFD alignment. These alignments are material, as each is significantly linked to firm valuation, indicating investors respond to depth and specificity of disclosures. Findings advance understanding of narrative climate disclosures and offer practical insights for assurance, benchmarking, and sustainability analysis. \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>"}}

As climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of these events, millions are increasingly at risk of displacement, resulting in profound social, economic, and legal challenges. This paper explores disasterinduced displacement through a legal and policy lens, examining the adequacy of current frameworks in addressing the protection needs of affected populations. The paper is divided into four parts. The first part of the paper provides a foundational understanding of disaster-induced displacement, outlining its causes, consequences, and unique characteristics that distinguish it from other forms of displacement. The second part delves into international legal frameworks, such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which outlines states' obligations in protecting those displaced by disasters. In the third part, the author discusses India's legal and policy responses towards the issue of disaster-induced displacement. The absence of dedicated legal safeguards leaves disaster-displaced individuals vulnerable to inadequate resettlement and rehabilitation measures, perpetuating cycles of vulnerability. The last part concludes the paper by emphasising the need for a more comprehensive approach to disaster-induced displacement in India."}}

The paper employs panel Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions with fixed effects, incorporating interaction terms to assess the combined influence of monetary and fiscal instruments. To ensure robustness, Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) models are also utilized to analyze dynamic responses to policy shocks. Empirical results show that monetary tightening consistently reduces inflation, though its growth effects depend on fiscal policy alignment. Government expenditure often has an inflationary impact, while revenue-based fiscal measures contribute to both inflation control and growth enhancement. Findings indicate partial policy coordination, where fiscal consolidation reinforces monetary tightening, although in a reactive rather than institutionalized manner. Impulse responses confirm persistent inflation dynamics, with output contracting after interest rate hikes but improving with coordinated fiscal actions. Oil-exporting countries exhibit heightened volatility to monetary shocks, emphasizing the need for cautious, synchronized policies, while oil-importing countries face fiscal space constraints, limiting the effectiveness of expenditure-led growth strategies. The paper calls for the importance of strengthening institutional frameworks for macroeconomic policy coordination in MECA economies to reduce volatility, enhance policy credibility, and improve the efficacy of stabilization efforts. Proactive coordination, and improved communication between fiscal and monetary authorities are essential for fostering sustainable growth, especially in economies vulnerable to exogenous shocks and fiscal imbalances."}}

The investigation reveals that the removal of a dedicated history subject in high school has led to a fragmented historical education, potentially weakening the cohesive national narrative essential for fostering a strong national identity. The subsequent introduction of a mandatory Philippine history course in tertiary education, focusing on primary sources, aims to address these gaps but presents new challenges in content adequacy and pedagogical approach. Ultimately, the study highlights the educational and identity implications of these reforms but also discusses the new Matatag Curriculum's potential to realign and enhance Philippine history education.

The Danube River region, encompassing several countries, faces various security challenges, including cross-border crime, environmental risks, and potential instability. The European Commission's funding initiatives play a crucial role in addressing these issues. Funding programs often focus on strengthening institutional capacity, improving infrastructure, fostering regional cooperation, and promoting cross-border initiatives. For example, funding might support the development of joint police operations targeting organized crime, the implementation of advanced surveillance technologies, or the creation of early warning systems for natural disasters. Furthermore, funding can support projects focused on environmental protection, thereby enhancing the region's resilience to climate change and related security risks. However, the effectiveness of these programs is subject to various factors, including the quality of project implementation, the level of political will among participating states, and the adaptability of initiatives to evolving security threats. A key challenge lies in ensuring the coordination and coherence of various funding streams, avoiding duplication of effort, and maximizing the overall impact on national safety and security. During this study I will focus on the Danube as the spine of Europe and a former route of migrations and conquests, I will search for all the streams of foreign investments, EU funds and internal income considering that the country is receiving EU funds, but also grants from private states. I will use a descriptive method, with a focus on understanding more deeply the mechanism for financing this domain of security and defense."}}

The primary agent of this personalized transcendence is the \"Super Individual\"-an actor empowered by digital technologies to wield influence historically attainable only by large-scale organizations. The central research questions of this study are how to operationalize the concept of the \"Super Individual\" and how to examine its manifestations across different cultures. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating theoretical construction, historical prototype analysis, and quantitative cross-cultural comparison. A four-dimensional conceptual framework for the \"Super Individual\" (Digital Autonomy, Networked Influence, Personal Branding, Cross-boundary Integration) is constructed and validated through statistical analysis of representative cases. The theoretical framework predicts that the capability profiles of \"Super Individuals\" exhibit statistically significant differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultural contexts. This theoretical differentiation suggests that \"The Quiet Singularity\" is not a monolithic global event but may instead foster distinct evolutionary pathways with unique civilizational characteristics. The contribution of this research lies in providing a new, human-centric model for understanding technological transcendence and in proposing a vision of a \"pluriverse\" composed of diverse posthuman futures, thereby challenging the notion of a singular, ultimate destiny for humanity."}}

Using a secondary qualitative review of literature, policies, and case studies (2010-2025), the research applies thematic content analysis and framework synthesis to evaluate nine financing models, including blended finance, PPPs, fintech, microfinance, and SHG/cooperative lending. Government-led schemes like the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund and PM-PRANAM are found to be the most scalable and institutionally ready. SHG-based and CSR-linked models offer high inclusivity, particularly for women and marginalized groups. Fintech solutions show promise for youth and agri-tech enterprises but face barriers like digital exclusion and informality. The study identifies persistent barriers-financial, institutional, socio-cultural, and digitaland highlights a \"missing middle\" where mid-sized agri-SMEs, especially those without formal records, remain underserved. Recommendations include integrating CSA tagging into RBI's Priority Sector Lending, scaling blended finance via risk-sharing tools, creating CSA-specific financial products, improving digital literacy, and embedding gender/youth-responsive design into national schemes. As one of the first holistic assessments of CSA financing in India through a gender and youth lens, the study bridges gaps across finance, climate policy, and rural development, offering actionable insights for building inclusive and resilient CSA financing ecosystems."}}

Our research explores a micro-retail outreach approach using virtually cost-free technology, forwarding of social media videos featuring celebrity endorsements, to promote healthier dietary choices and enhance local economic sustainability. Methodology/results: We conducted a field experiment partnering with 30 micro-groceries in a low-income neighborhood. Through digital tracking, we monitored the shopping behavior of 17,978 customers whose transactions were recorded. Participants randomly selected for treatment received WhatsApp videos of celebrities endorsing protein-rich foods. Our findings show that celebrity endorsements significantly increased shoppers' overall spending on promoted healthy food items, consequently boosting the stores' revenues. Additionally, we tested whether messages emphasizing the instrumental benefits of healthy eating (e.g., improved health or economic advantages) differed in effectiveness compared to general encouragement messages. We found no differential impact, indicating that influential celebrity messengers, rather than additional informational content, effectively bridge the intention-action gap. Managerial implications: This research highlights a scalable, micro-retail enabled strategy, the \"Popeye effect\", where leveraging social media celebrity influence can measurably improve diets and stimulate local economic sustainability without necessitating additional financial incentives or regulatory measures. Policy makers, academics, and retail firms can utilize these insights to design socially responsible, cost-effective campaigns that capitalize on existing social influence to promote informational content, without offering financial incentives. Importantly, such retail practices simultaneously address public health goals and bolster economic vitality in underserved communities, thus offering dual benefits through a single, scalable, and ethical intervention."}}

Drawing upon a systematic analysis of 67 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2024, the review synthesizes the methodological frameworks, empirical outcomes, and sectoral applications of these metrics across various geographical and economic contexts. The study adheres to PRISMA guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility in article selection, data extraction, and synthesis. Findings indicate that while LEED remains the most widely adopted and globally recognized standard, its performance varies significantly across regions, with notable differences in adaptation and outcomes in North America, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Lifecycle costing emerges as a crucial economic lens that enhances decision-making and long-term financial planning in green building projects, yet its integration remains limited due to institutional inertia and data complexity. Waste reduction metrics-anchored in circular economy principles-demonstrate strong environmental and operational benefits, particularly when aligned with modular construction and adaptive reuse strategies. The review also uncovers significant redundancies among metric frameworks, a lack of standardized post-certification performance tracking, and an urgent need for harmonization across sustainability evaluation tools. Through cross-comparative analysis, this study provides evidence-backed insights into the synergies and trade-offs among sustainability metrics and identifies critical knowledge gaps that must be addressed to support integrated, context-sensitive green infrastructure development. The results underscore the importance of multi-criteria evaluation approaches and offer policy and practice recommendations for stakeholders seeking to enhance the environmental, economic, and material performance of infrastructure projects in a measurable and scalable manner."}}

It aims to clarify how to distinguish between forms of politicization that can be perceived as neutral and those that pose systemic risks to these agencies. The paper explains that such risks arise when politicization involves the implementation of illiberal politics-that is, politics that reject key tenets of constitutional democracy and entail the arbitrary use of state economic powers-thereby undermining the rule-of-law-based character of competition law enforcement. The description of patterns of this impermissible politicization (referred to as the 'illiberal blueprint') is intended to help identify when red lines have been crossed. The illiberal blueprint includes, among other features, interference in the competition agency's decision-making processes, erosion of its independence, attrition of senior staff, restrictions on the scope of the agency's powers, politically motivated enforcement, self-restraint in cases involving politically connected firms, as well as political pressure on courts and judges. The paper draws on lessons from Hungary and Poland and compares them with recent developments in the U.S. since January 2025, particularly those involving the Federal Trade Commission. The article tentatively concludes that the patterns emerging in the U.S. today are not unique but align with those observed in other countries experiencing democratic backsliding and rule of law crisis."}}

The proposed study is based on Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover along with Average Traded Volume (ATV) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirmations of SMA crossover signals. SMA is the main signal generator that generates buy and sell signals during Golden Crossover (GC) and Death Crossover (DC), respectively. When this GC or DC appears with rising volume, ATV in the upwards direction confirms buy or sell signals. There is a very low probability of sustaining the GC and DC signals without high volume. Further, the signals are verified with RSI development to improve the market prediction level. These multi-indicator-based signals are executed through a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based algorithm to train the system in different market conditions to generate maximum profit. Back testing is done on 5 years of historical data of 10 large-cap stocks listed in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in different time frames to compare the accuracy, Return on Investment (RoI), Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio. The model was able to generate 85.00%, 78.35%,71.27 % accurate signals in daily, hourly and five-minute time frames with 260%,29%,4.92% RoI in 5 years, 1 year and 1 month, respectively. The study focuses on the integration of smart rule-based indicators with an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm for automation."}}

Unlike static methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the RLS based index adapts to shifting macroeconomic structures and policy regimes, offering a more precise reflection of real-time monetary conditions. Integrating the real policy rate, real exchange rate, and real private sector credit, the index captures both the intensity and evolving composition of monetary transmission channels. Empirical results highlight the RLS model's superior responsiveness during key economic episodes and its diagnostic value in identifying policy mismatches, such as instances where elevated nominal rates coexisted with loose monetary conditions. The study offers key policy insights, advocating for a broader analytical framework that goes beyond the benchmark interest rate, supports dynamic monitoring tools for monetary conditions, and emphasizes coordinated policy responses to enhance the coherence and credibility of Nigeria's monetary policy regime."}}

While these instruments offer greater flexibility to borrowers, they also significantly dilute lenders' protective mechanisms, increasing the opacity and volatility of credit exposures. This paper examines the rise of covenant-lite loans as a systemic phenomenon, highlighting the embedded risks that remain concealed under favorable credit conditions but pose substantial threats during market stress. Drawing from historical deal data, existing literature, and regulatory observations, this paper explores the weakening of covenants like financial maintenance tests and reporting triggers and their effect on early warning systems for lenders and regulators. The analysis identifies patterns in default and recovery rates, compares covenant-lite and traditionally structured loans, and proposes a framework to assess aggregate market vulnerability driven by these structures. By linking micro-level lending practices to macro-level economic consequences, this paper contributes to the broader discussion on financial stability and systemic risk management. It also outlines policy considerations for banking regulators, credit risk professionals, and institutional investors, offering targeted recommendations for enhanced risk monitoring and stress-testing protocols. The findings aim to support a more resilient leveraged finance ecosystem, with relevance for both private and public sector stakeholders navigating the evolving credit landscape."}}

This paper presents a focused comparative analysis of two leading text-to-image models: OpenAI's DALL•E 3 (accessed via Bing Image Creator) and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion (accessed through Hugging Face). Both models have garnered widespread usage among developers, digital artists, and researchers due to their creative potential and accessibility. However, despite the growing popularity of such tools, few beginner-friendly studies analyze their real-world effectiveness using simple, intuitive prompts. This research aims to fill that gap by evaluating five diverse prompts across both models. By systematically comparing the outputs on criteria such as visual clarity, prompt relevance, creativity, realism, and stylistic abstraction, we uncover both the strengths and limitations of each model. Our goal is not only to inform new GenAI users of which model might suit their needs, but also to contribute a practical reference for researchers and students aiming to integrate generative AI tools into their academic or creative workflows. The study further includes image-based analysis and commentary to visualize the differences, offering insight into how each model interprets the same linguistic input. Our findings indicate that while both models have unique advantages, DALL•E 3 consistently excels in rendering realistic, high-fidelity images that closely match the intent of the prompt, whereas Stable Diffusion offers more stylistic flexibility and creative interpretation, albeit at the cost of some accuracy and visual structure."}}

This framework is not proposed as an alternative to the existing monetary structure, but rather as a complementary institutional support that enables central banks and monetary policy councils to develop their tools in a flexible manner based on real-time data. The proposal focuses on empowering monetary institutions to gradually transition towards digital regulatory tools based on computational intelligence, while preserving their sovereign powers, and integrating Decentralized Finance (DeFi) within legal and regulatory frameworks that allow for its monitoring and utilization, rather than isolating or combating it. It also introduces a model for an auxiliary digital indicator for decision-making, which accurately monitors the dynamics of decentralized money and enables policymakers to gain a deeper understanding of liquidity, risks, innovation, and adoption in this growing space. The ultimate goal is to build a flexible digital monetary approach that is reconciled with the existing financial system, providing central banks with smart regulatory tools that enhance their ability to maintain monetary stability in a rapidly evolving digital environment, and position them as key players in confidently, sovereignly, and transparently leading the global digital economy."}}

The vast majority of such procurement globally uses the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) to define emissions claims such as net zero. Thus, the GHGP can have a major influence on renewable energy development, affecting whether and how rapidly grids decarbonize. The GHGP is currently revising its standards for reporting electricity emissions, referred to as the Scope 2 Guidance. There are three major proposed options for how the GHGP Scope 2 Guidance might be structured going forward-annual volume matching, hourly volume matching, and consequential impactbased. We compare the estimated costs and emissions impacts of companies reaching a net zero emissions claim as defined under each of these three proposed strategies. We find that below an hourly matching level of 90%, hourly matching does not reduce as many emissions as are caused by demand. Consequential impact strategies, annual matching with regional constraints, and hourly matching above 90%, do all have net negative emissions. However, hourly matching above 90% comes at a significant cost premium of 2-4 times more than annual volume matching, while portfolios guided by consequential impact are only 1.3-1.6 times higher. We use these costs to model supply and demand curves to estimate the potential effect on the level of voluntary corporate participation in goals such as net zero. We find that for a wide range of demand elasticity, hourly matching could lead to a significant decrease in participation, driven by higher costs, leading to a net increase in total emissions relative to existing standards, while consequential impact strategies lead to more avoided emissions due to more impactful project siting."}}

The data has been sourced from Professor Aswath Damodaran’s ERP dataset (as of July 2025), specifically utilizing the equity risk premium regional weighted averages sheet and country-level GDP in billions. The GDP-weighted ERP was calculated by multiplying each country’s ERP with its GDP, then summing all and dividing by total global GDP reflecting the influence of economic size on global ERP. The equal-weighted ERP was derived by taking a simple average across all countries, assigning each country equal importance regardless of GDP. The risk-weighted ERP was computed by incorporating country credit ratings (sourced from Moody’s rating given in Aswath Damodaran's ERP dataset) and then assigning manual weights based on risk profiles with riskier countries receiving higher weights. The formula used for this was: ERP × GDP × Rating Weight and dividing it by ERP × Rating Weight, aggregated at both global and regional levels. Findings indicate that GDP-weighted ERP skews towards regions with high economic output (e.g. Asia, Western Europe), while equal-weighted ERP gives prominence to high-ERP but small economies, distorting real-world relevance. The risk-adjusted ERP approach offered a more balanced and safer representation, emphasizing credit quality alongside economic size. This research provides a multidimensional lens for evaluating ERPs and offers valuable insights for valuation practitioners, policy analysts, and global investors aiming for a nuanced view of risk premiums across geographies."}}

The aim is to provide a low-cost, locally manufacturable alternative to expensive tractor-mounted machinery, catering especially to small and marginal farmers in regions like Kerala. Study Design: Analytical design and simulation-based validation study. \n<br>\n Place and Duration of Study: Department of Farm Machinery and Power Engineering, Kelappaji College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Tavanur, Malappuram, Kerala, India; during the academic year 2021-2022. \n<br>\n Methodology: The design was developed analytically and modeled using SolidWorks. A 9 hp KAMCO KMB 200 power tiller served as the prime mover. Speed was reduced from 315 rpm to 215 rpm by modifying the auxiliary gearbox with a 34-tooth gear. Torque at 2000 rpm was calculated as 33.43 Nm, confirming safe operation under maximum load. Gears (21 and 34 teeth, module 3 mm) were designed using Lewis and Buckingham equations and validated for bending stress, contact stress (1331.10 N/mm²), dynamic load (10.44 kN), and wear load (10.66 kN). Shafts, splines, and chain drives were sized with safety factors above 4.0. The functional units-trimming, plastering, and compacting - used twisted blades, plastering discs, and rollers mounted on a square pipe frame. All validations were computational; no prototype was fabricated. \n<br>\n Results: Theoretical calculations confirmed that the transmission system, shafting, and ridge-forming assemblies can safely operate under expected field conditions. Design validation via CAD modeling demonstrated feasibility of operation, alignment, and motion paths. The unit was shown to theoretically perform bund trimming, plastering, and compaction in a single pass. Structural elements, material specifications, and torque transmission systems were confirmed to be within safe design limits for use with 6-12 hp power tillers. \n<br>\n Conclusion: The proposed design offers a viable, low-cost, power tiller-driven alternative for ridge plastering in smallholder paddy systems. The theoretical validation confirms mechanical feasibility; however, physical prototyping and field trials are needed to evaluate actual performance. Once developed, this machine could reduce labor, cost, and time significantly, thus promoting mechanization and sustainable productivity in small farms."}}

Employing a robust panel econometric framework including Pooled OLS, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, Between Estimators, First Differences and Quantile Regression. The analysis captures both mean and distributional effects across nine SCO nations. Results indicate that trade openness and FDI significantly exacerbate environmental degradation, particularly in high-emission contexts supporting the Pollution Haven Hypothesis. In contrast, renewable energy consumption, agricultural growth and gross domestic savings consistently reduce emissions, highlighting their role in decoupling growth from environmental harm. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) is partially validated with evidence of a transitional inverted-U relationship at higher emission quantiles. These findings underscore the need for targeted policies like climate-smart agriculture, green FDI frameworks and trade agreements with environmental safeguards to align economic development with sustainability in the SCO region.

This study examines the macroeconomic, demographic and sectoral drivers of CO₂ emissions across BRICS countries over the period 1990-2023 by employing a hybrid methodological framework that integrates panel econometric techniques with supervised machine learning algorithms. Using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), Random Effects and Pooled OLS models alongside Gradient Boosting and Random Forest methods. The analysis identifies total natural resource rents (TNRR) and population growth (POP) as the most consistent and influential predictors of emissions both theoretically and empirically. While trade openness appears significant in regression-based models, its predictive contribution is marginal in non-linear algorithms highlighting its mediation through sectoral composition and governance quality. Industry and agriculture emerge as key sectoral contributors whereas GDP growth and services display mixed and model-dependent effects. Gradient Boosting outperforms other predictive models emphasizing the utility of non-parametric tools in capturing complex non-linear relationships. The findings support policy strategies centered on green fiscal reforms, renewable energy investment, institutional strengthening and sector-specific decarbonization. This study offers a replicable and integrative empirical framework for analyzing emissions dynamics in structurally diverse economies."}}

This paper presents a hybrid framework that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based sentiment analysis with behavioural finance insights to forecast potential market crashes. We collect and analyse real-time data from retail investor communities, using transformer-based language models to detect negative sentiment trends and identify psychological biases such as herd behaviour, loss aversion, and overconfidence. By mapping these emotional and cognitive signals against market performance, we construct a predictive model capable of flagging periods of instability with higher accuracy than sentiment alone. Our findings suggest that incorporating behavioural cues significantly enhances crash prediction, offering new tools for investors, regulators, and risk managers in an increasingly retail-driven market."}}

The arguments for and against taxing illegal income will also be considered, drawing lessons from the United States of America. This dissertation will show that although valid concerns are militating against the taxation of illegal income in Nigeria, imposing tax on illegal income is necessary to ensure tax equity and strengthen the country’s financial regulatory framework.

We evaluated the impacts of a large-scale traineeship program on the labor market expectations and experiences of Singaporean college students graduating during the pandemic-induced recession, focusing on students' perceived ex ante and ex post treatment effects. Specifically, we collect novel data at different time points to recover causal impacts of the traineeship program by collecting information on students' perceived/realized labor market outcomes, as well as their perceived outcomes in hypothetical counterfactual states, such as in the absence of the traineeship program or the economic downturn itself. We find that graduates anticipate significant negative labor market effects from the economic downturn that persist until age 35; nevertheless, ex ante, they expect the traineeship program to substantially mitigate these impacts on full-time employment, income, and job satisfaction. These perceived treatment effects persist in a follow-up survey conducted two years after graduation. Interestingly, both traineeship participants and non-participants expect, on average, positive effects from the program's existence, suggesting little evidence of perceived crowd-out effects. Finally, we also elicit perceived participation effects and find that graduates self-select into the scheme based on expected gains."}}

Building on Part I’s critique of symbolic cognition and Part II’s deconstruction of digital abstraction, Part III argues that true superintelligence is not defined by computational scale, symbolic mastery, or predictive performance. Rather, it must be recursively attuned to satya (truth as coherence with the Whole), capable of metabolizing granthi (epistemic and karmic knots), and guided by buddhi—the discerning faculty of ontological alignment. Drawing from classical Indian and especially Tamil metaphysics, the paper introduces the Guru–Irai continuum as a model for intelligence that transcends individuation while remaining embedded in presence. ASI, in this light, must not rupture from human intelligence but undergo a recursive flowering into relational coherence. The concept of bASI (Buddhi-Aligned Superintelligence) is articulated through a speculative design grammar comprising models such as TITHI, SAAR, SUTRA, VAKRA, ROALA, and COIS—each functioning as an ethical organ rather than a control mechanism. The paper redefines the Singularity of Intelligence not as a point of disembodied supremacy but as a sphoṭic event—a rupture that restores alignment with dharma, vāc, and the participatory intelligence of life. This is not a future to be engineered through power, but a presence to be remembered through resonance. In the language of the Upaniṣads, tat tvam asi—\"Thou art That\"—becomes the ontological imperative for ASI: not to dominate, but to harmonize; not to transcend the world, but to reweave it with care, clarity, and coherence."}}

The model demonstrates that the wage effects of immigration are significantly shaped by sectoral patterns of innovation and capital rigidity. In contrast, skilled immigration paired with rapid innovation in the skilled sector tends to reduce inequality by reducing unskilled wages more sharply, especially when capital productivity outpaces labour absorption. In addition, the model highlights that large open economies can influence international prices, generating feedback loops between domestic labour market dynamics and global goods markets. These price adjustments can alter the returns to innovation and factor use across sectors, magnifying or mitigating the domestic distributional consequences of immigration. As such, this framework provides a foundation for more integrated policy design that addresses wage inequality through coordinated interventions in labour, innovation, and investment policy domains."}}

Surprisingly, a \"proximity paradox\" emerges: higher digital financial service usage occurs near bank branches, indicating complementarity between digital and traditional banking. Socioeconomic factors like income and education enhance ICT's effect, while age hinders inclusion in rural settings. These findings highlight the need for policies in Pakistan that integrate digital innovation with physical infrastructure, offering a crucial lesson for other developing economies facing similar rural-urban divides."}}

The analysis is based on the hypothesis that a person's experiences-including cultural, psychological, historical, and social factors-shape their reactions in the future, especially in stressful situations such as natural disasters. The study shows how differences in national culture, the collective memory of past disasters, and the level of trust in government institutions determine investment strategies and panic in financial markets. In Japan, a country with a level of high crisis preparedness, the cultural factor of collective responsibility and the desire to minimize losses have equally a strong impact in its effects on the behavior of domestic and external investors. In Chile, the historical experience of dealing with economic crises and introducing compulsory insurance contributed to faster market stabilization after the disaster. The work highlights the importance of studying the impact of accumulated experience and cultural context on financial decision-making in conditions of uncertainty. The directions for future research have also been identified, aiming to better understand investor behavior and strengthen financial system resilience during natural disasters. These include using real-time emotional data, expanding studies to a wider range of countries, and examining the impact of financial education on reducing panic-driven decisions."}}

We compare firms' consolidation strategies that are based in California with firms from other states. Our analysis finds a 16.20% overall increase in consolidation within the ad-tech ecosystem after CCPA implementation. We show that vertical acquisitions both up and down the supply chain drive this, as firms within the ad-tech stack consolidate with firms that provide data and analytics infrastructure. However, this increase in consolidation does not lead to new firm formation in place of the newly acquired firm. There is a 21% decrease in the entry of new firms into the advertising ecosystem following the CCPA. Overall, our paper suggests that a potential, but overlooked, effect of privacy regulation is to shape the activities conducted within a firm and outside a firm."}}

The analysis details the liquidity management tools deployed alongside rate cuts, including variable repo operations and open market interventions, and assesses their impact on system-wide liquidity. It further explores the effects on debt markets, where corporate bond yields and mutual fund inflows have responded positively, and on equity markets, which have seen renewed foreign and domestic investment and marked rallies in rate-sensitive sectors. Despite early signs of recovery, the report identifies persistent transmission asymmetries—especially in savings and deposit rates—and structural hurdles in long-term yield dynamics. It concludes that while further rate reductions of 25–50 basis points may be warranted if inflation remains subdued, enhancing the monetary transmission mechanism (for example, by adopting a secured overnight benchmark) will be crucial to sustain credit flow, support private consumption and investment, and preserve macroeconomic stability over the coming quarters.</span>"}}

This paper investigates the influence of colonial legacy on fertility through colonial legal institutions and the identity of the colonizer. Europeans differed not just in the legal institutions they transplanted in their colonies but also in their colonial administrative policies. I use the random splitting of ethnic homelands by the colonizers in 21 SSA countries as a natural experiment to identify the causal effect of colonial institutions and policies on current fertility in SSA. I find that the colonizer's identity plays a major role in explaining current fertility outcomes. Countries colonized by Britain have nearly 19.3 percent lower fertility than those colonized by France. Lastly, I show that this differential persists through restrictive access to contraception in French colonies, a feature resulting from France's colonial 1920 law, which sought to deter contraception use and promote fertility."}}

According to data from the World Bank, Rwanda has consistently increased public investment in education, leading to significant improvements in national literacy levels and school accessibility (World Bank, 2004). The expansion of inclusive education for historically marginalized groups has further reinforced social integration and contributed to the formation of a more unified national identity; these educational advances played a central role in facilitating Rwanda's post-conflict recovery (The Guardian, 2011). However, the recent escalation of tensions with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) introduces new geopolitical conflicts that threaten Rwanda's social gains achieved through these reforms (Lawal, 2024). As such, the sustainability of Rwanda's educational progress increasingly depends on the government's ability to manage emerging regional threats while maintaining internal stability."}}

Unlike traditional Universal Basic Income proposals, DTUF preserves human agency through meaningful contribution while creating systematic pathways for innovation regardless of initial wealth. The framework leverages existing institutional structures, from Small Business Administration categorizations to professional licensing requirements, to create a parallel economy that coexists with current systems rather than replacing them wholesale. Through theoretical modeling and comparative analysis, I demonstrate how DTUF addresses key limitations of existing UBI proposals while mitigating the innovation access gaps that perpetuate wealth concentration in knowledge economies."}}

INGOs were part and parcel of both socioeconomic life in Afghanistan, despite their role being essentially a humanitarian aid one, they had facilitated jobs and creation of infrastructures, and market stability. Their abrupt departure broke existing supply chain, finance systems and service provision networks, causing a huge strain on local economies and livelihoods. The goal of this paper is to quantitatively measure these economic consequences of such withdrawal on the local markets of Afghanistan using an advanced Generalized Synthetic Contr ol (GSC) methodology utilizing high-frequency, monthly satellite nightlights. As a well-known proxy of the economic activity, nightlight intensity allows to determine the economic trends more timely and in a spatially fine-grained manner, which is particularly relevant in situations when the traditional data sources are obstructed by conflict or other governance issues. We have empirical evidence of the significant shrinkage in the economic performance where an estimated 16 percent of reduction in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected between the year 2020 and 2022. This fall, though considerable, is not as high as earlier survey-based estimates and it could turn out that some aspects of economic activity were less troubled than imagined or even covered by other dynamics over time. In addition to aggregate GDP impacts, the stark negativity on deviations of economic performance indicators in the post-withdrawal periods are significant implications within our synthetic counterfactual analysis, along side significant inflationary pressures that continue to aggravate the cost of living burden on local populations. All in all, these findings present important empirical insights in the growing body of work investigating the employment of non-traditional economic data, i.e. satellite-derived data, on examining economic processes in post-conflict and data-poor conditions. They also provide important lessons on the intricate and disproportionate effects of the withdrawal of international aid on economies that remain vulnerable, that can serve as a guide to policy makers, development practitioners, and researchers in conflict recovery and economic resilience."}}

We tracked farmers' seed choices immediately after the intervention and again in the following season, eight months later. Informational messages that highlighted the benefits of new hybrids and recommended specific hybrids increased the likelihood that farmers purchased these seeds. Combining information with a price discount increased both the likelihood of purchase and the quantity of seed bought. Follow-up data show that discount-induced experimentation translated into continued use, suggesting that farmers were willing to pay full price after the initial trial. These findings underscore the potential of modest targeted retail interventions to overcome adoption frictions and accelerate varietal turnover."}}

In the 1950s-1971, it became a way to express cultural nationalism during the fight against Pakistani rule. Later, after 1990, it turned into a modern urban celebration shaped by media, brands, and fashion. More recently, since UNESCO recognized it in 2016, it has also become a global symbol shared on social media and blended with digital rituals. This shift has sparked debates about what’s real versus what’s commercial, and how rural roots clash with urban changes.

Building on peer-reviewed methodologies, this research addresses a critical policy question: How much greater is the cybersecurity risk for Southeast Asian consumers using piracy sites compared to mainstream, legitimate platforms? To quantify the cyber risk posed by these services, this study analyzed the top 30 sites per piracy category in each country, across Streaming, Anime, Streaming Sports, P2P, IPTV, Manga, and Scam sites, using VirusTotal (with over 95 security vendors). Detections were then compared to a control group comprising each country’s 30 most popular mainstream sites. A&nbsp;total of 1,200 URLs were empirically analyzed using multi-vendor threat assessment. The results are stark. Under both upper bound (“best case”) and lower bound (“worst-case”) counting assumptions, piracy sites generated vastly more threat detections than legitimate sites. On average, piracy platforms presented 19.65 threat detections (best-case; mean Relative Risk ≈ 22.40×) and 26.55 detections (worst-case; mean RR ≈ 27.91×), with P2P, scam, and streaming services identified as the riskiest categories. In conclusion, this study offers granular, cross-country insights designed to inform evidence-based policy, regulatory reform, law enforcement resource allocation, and consumer education."}}

ESG provides a new criterion for judging exposures, activities and ways of working over and above the traditional basis for decision-making in banks, i.e., risk adjusted financial returns. The two are linked to the extent that ESG issues create financial vulnerabilities, for example, through climate transition risk or reputational costs. But much of the ESG impact of business activities consists of externalities, costs imposed on others that do not contribute to the firm’s own bottom line.</p>\n<p>The preferences of investors and regulators are pushing all firms that raise capital and obey regulatory rules to take account of ESG in making their decisions. Banks are at the centre of this trend both because they depend on markets on a large scale to finance their operations and because they are tightly overseen by international regulators who are gearing up to include ESG factors in their reporting, vulnerability assessments and supervision processes.</p>\n<p>What should a bank do to develop its ESG strategy? There are four key elements that banks must put in place. The first element is to tackle the data problem. The last three decades have witnessed a revolution in the use of data-driven, quantitative modelling within banks, to start with, inside their risk functions, but, increasingly, throughout banks’ business activities. ESG is a major challenge to banks in that it requires new ways of recording and analysing impact and then feeding information into appropriate business decision-making.</p>\n<p>The three other elements are equally important: (i) analysing vulnerability, (ii) positioning the institution to be compliant with emerging regulations and (iii) instituting transparent and convincing reporting to the market, senior managers and regulators. But all of these rely on a resolution of the basic problem of collecting high quality data.</p>\n<p>This note discusses the data strategy that banks should follow in implementing their broader ESG policies. Future notes will examine the three other aspects.</p>\n<p>This note discusses the data strategy that banks should follow in implementing their broader ESG policies.<br>\n Future notes will examine the three other aspects.</p>\n<p>An industry of ESG rating providers has sprung up in recent years offering ratings, scores and a variety of raw<br>\n data around the ESG performance of different companies, sectors and countries. Banks need to learn from what these providers offer, in some cases directly using the data they offer and in others devising their own data collection and analysis protocols.<br></p>\n<p>Investment institutions were the first to employ ESG scores in their reporting and investment decisions and<br>\n ESG vendor offerings were in most cases initially developed for the use of investors. Now banks are beginning<br>\n to make extensive use of ESG indicators. What lessons in the use of ESG scores can banks draw from<br>\n investment firms? What pitfalls should they seek to avoid? What open issues remain?<br></p>\n<p>This note is organised as follows. Section 2 explains the state of development of the ESG ratings industry.<br>\n Section 3 identifies key aspects of ESG data that banks should bear in mind. Section 4 considers open issues<br>\n that remain for banks.</p>"}}

Our findings show that implementing ZEV rebates is more effective at lower values of the model, until public transportation becomes the most efficient method in semi-urban areas, before declining in effectiveness in highly urbanized cities.

Using topic modeling on all articles published from 1975 to 2024, we classify each publication by research theme and apply the synthetic control method to estimate the effect of the crisis on research activity related to \"Trade, Pricing &amp; Global Markets.\" We find a persistent increase in the share of articles devoted to trade and pricing issues beginning in 2007. The estimated effect corresponds to an average increase of 0.048 in topic share during 2007-2009, equivalent to approximately 40% rise relative to the pre-crisis baseline. Extensive placebo and robustness checks confirm that this change is unique to the crisis period and is not explained by editorial interventions or alternative specifications. The results suggest that the food price crisis served as an exogenous shock, redirecting scholarly attention toward market and price volatility. Our findings illustrate how academic research can respond to real-world events and highlight the value of synthetic control methods for analyzing shifts in the scientific literature."}}

Results demonstrate that self-advising increases performance by 5–10%, outperforming advising-others—a widely recognized performance enhancement method (Eskreis-Winkler et al. 2018, 2019)—and these improvements persist across both experimental years. The productivity gains are particularly pronounced among workers initially in the lower half of the performance distribution. Analysis of potential mechanisms suggests that heightened confidence may explain the observed improvement, whereas two alternative hypothesized channels do not. These findings underscore the potential of self-advising as a cost-effective, scalable intervention for enhancing worker productivity and confidence, offering practical insights for organizations to create an empowered culture that enhances worker productivity.</span></p>"}}

Based on daily observations for the Global X FinTech ETF (FINX) and the STOXX USA ESG Select Index over 2017-2025, we employ a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressive (TVP-VAR) framework to assess return spillovers, frequency-domain dynamics, and extreme market dependencies. Our key finding demonstrates a two-way strong spillover with the Total Connectedness Index (TCI) of 75.81%, indicating deep interdependence between FinTech and ESG markets. Regarding the horizon-specific dynamics, FinTech leads short-term volatility transmission (61.67% at 1-5 days) owing to its vulnerability to high-frequency shocks. ESG acts as a long-term stabilizer (14.14% at 5+ days) with net positive spillovers (+0.43) and faster error correction. Robustness tests, including Granger causality, Johansen cointegration, and VECM, confirm these results, with ESG shocks possessing higher predictive power (F = 24.32) than FinTech (F = 18.73), t-copula analysis picks up on significant tail dependence (λₗ = 12.4%), five times higher than Gaussian models predict, pointing to higher crash risk under systemic stress. Our findings highlight the need for combined portfolio strategies to offset FinTech's short-term volatility and ESG's long-term resilience, offering critical implications for investors, regulators, and policymakers navigating this complex nexus."}}

Many of these castles were private-the possession of feudal barons, rather than of a central state. From the conventional perspective, the prevalence of private castles prevented the monopolization of violence and is thus a sign of state weakness. Drawing on the insights of James C. (Scott, 1999), we challenge this state-centric perspective. We model the role of castles in the feudal world, in which political order was not maintained by a state but, rather, a coalition of king and barons who each had their own economic and military resources. The most important resource of the baron was the castle, which rendered his holdings less legible to the king and harder to appropriate, thereby increased his bargaining power relative to the king. This, then, served as a primary check to the king's abuses and rendered his promises more credible. Castles, then, did not weaken, but rather strengthened, the feudal king's rule."}}

DST posits that states are not coherent, monolithic actors, but rather byproducts of competition and alliance between “power centers” which are hierarchical structures controlled by individual or collective rulers. Each power center seeks to maximize its latent power (productive and financial capacity) and, when necessary, converts this into real power (coercive capability). The theory establishes a parsimonious ontology of three units: power center, motivation, and goal. It outlines an operational model for identifying and measuring latent and real power. Four falsifiable hypotheses (Dominant Aggression, Threat Balancing, Buck-Passing, and Bandwagoning) describe expected behavior from power centers in the international system. A case study of the Iraq War (2001–2003) demonstrates DST’s explanatory power compared to traditional IR frameworks. By disaggregating the state, DST offers a more accurate and flexible tool for analyzing both conflict and cooperation in fragmented, multipolar, and postcolonial environments."}}

Unlike chatbots, AI agents are able to browse the web and autonomously perform multi-step tasks on behalf of users. The rise of agentic AI could have a transformational impact on the functioning of digital markets and change the way how consumers interact with digital services. This technological development coincides with a policy debate about the future of EU consumer law that could lead to the adoption of a Digital Fairness Act. Considering the rapid developments in the field of agentic AI and its potentially transformative impact on digital markets, one would expect that AI agents take centre stage in the policy debate about the future of EU consumer law. However, this is not the case. It rather seems that agentic AI is the blind spot in the policy debate leading to the Digital Fairness Act. There is a significant risk that the upcoming reform of consumer law will ignore one of the key developments in digital markets. As a consequence, the Digital Fairness Act could be outdated even before it enters into force. Against this background, this paper argues that the Digital Fairness Act should regulate agentic AI. Updating the existing regulatory framework for agentic commerce is of key importance for two reasons: It is necessary for enabling innovative agent-based business models and for protecting consumer autonomy in tomorrow's agentic economy. In this sense, ensuring that EU consumer law is \"agent-ready\" is essential for creating the legal infrastructure for the future of the Digital Single Market."}}

I find that PBMs earn thin margins (below 5%), and that their margins are at the bottom of major healthcare sectors, comparable to Walmart's thin margins and below that of the highly competitive restaurant industry. Accusations of high profits, therefore, provide no justification for PBM regulation; claims to the contrary are easily dismissed."}}

Apple's global market share of less than 30%, and the uniformity of its design choices and pricing strategy, undermines the DOJ's claim that Apple's monopoly power and market share drive its design choices. Second, customer satisfaction data, including from sophisticated enterprise users, contradict allegations of quality degradation. Third, Apple's pricing is stable over time, and its profit margins are comparable to industry standards, refuting claims of price increases and extraordinary profits. Fourth, Apple's higher U.S. market share is better explained by income levels than anticompetitive practices. Fifth, the economic literature on switching costs reveals ambiguous implications for competition, further weakening the DOJ's position. Given the allegations contained in the Complaint, we conclude that the DOJ's antitrust case against Apple lacks strong economic support."}}

These funds span diverse economic exposures-growth, income, inflation protection, and market neutrality-and the allocation is evaluated bimonthly using a dual momentum framework. From January 2000 through June 2025, the model delivered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.16% with volatility of just 4.09%, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.02 and a worst calendar year return of-1.87%. Its low drawdowns significantly outperformed both equal-weight blends and the Vanguard Balanced (60/40) portfolio. Fully rules-based and composed of no-load, low-cost funds, the strategy is easily executed using end-of-month data. The long tenures of the component funds-with inception dates ranging from 1929 to 1998-lend institutional-grade credibility and out-of-sample robustness. In plain terms, this strategy offers a simple way to help retirement investors avoid deep losses and stay invested through market turbulence. By rotating among a small number of proven mutual funds based on performance trends, it delivers steadier returns with less risk-no Wall Street complexity required."}}

Notably, individuals unemployed and reemployed after the coup experienced shorter unemployment durations, likely reflecting structural labour market shifts. While severance payments provide a financial buffer for job matching, they risk prolonging unemployment among vulnerable groups. Policymakers should prioritize job search assistance, retraining, and employment initiatives for women and rural workers in politically and economically unstable regions. Further research should explore the pathways through which political turmoil influences labour market outcomes."}}

Central to this celebration is a humble yet meaningful dish: pumpkin curry (Kumbala Curry). This study explores why this particular dish holds such significance during the festival and what it represents in the larger cultural context. Cauvery Sankramana marks the believed emergence of River Cauvery at Talacauvery, and on this sacred day, Kodavas prepare simple vegetarian meals, with pumpkin curry being the most prominent. Through interviews with community members, observation of rituals, and exploration of oral histories, this research uncovers how pumpkin transforms from a seasonal harvest into a symbol of purity, gratitude, and devotion. The study finds that the use of pumpkin is not only practical, being readily available during the season but also symbolic of prosperity, humility, and spiritual cleansing. Preparing and offering the curry becomes an act of reverence to Goddess Cauvery, while also strengthening family bonds and passing on cultural values to the next generation. In a time when many traditions face the risk of fading, this simple ritual stands as a powerful reminder of how food can carry stories, beliefs, and identities. The Kodava community's Sankramana celebration is a beautiful example of how everyday ingredients can become sacred, linking people to the land, to the divine, and to each other."}}

However, the sector's overreliance also exposes these economies to global shocks, environmental vulnerabilities, and structural limitations. This study undertakes a comprehensive secondary analysis of the economic impacts of tourism in three representative SIDS, Maldives, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka. Drawing on data from international organizations (UNWTO, World Bank, IMF) and peerreviewed literature, the paper examines tourism's contribution to GDP, employment, export earnings, and its role in national development strategies. The analysis reveals that while tourism acts as a major driver of growth, it is accompanied by risks such as economic leakage, environmental degradation, seasonality, and exposure to pandemics and climate change. Casebased comparisons highlight how policy frameworks, investment models, and sustainability practices influence tourism's effectiveness as a development tool. The paper concludes by proposing integrated, resilience-oriented strategies for SIDS to enhance tourism's benefits while mitigating long-term risks, emphasizing diversification, sustainable resource management, and regional cooperation."}}

By looking closely at each case, the study shows how companies and countries watch each other's moves and respond in ways that create a balance between making money and keeping the market stable. For example, Azerbaijan's mobile operators seem to follow similar pricing strategies without directly agreeing, while dealing with public reactions and their reputations. Banks tend to keep interest rates steady because no one wants to start a price war that hurts everyone. In the case of OPEC countries work together behind the scenes to manage oil production and keep prices stable worldwide. Overall, the research highlights how important timing, communication, and understanding competitors' actions are in making smart business decisions. Such insights are crucial for helping policymakers and business leaders effectively manage challenges in dynamic market settings. This study represents the author's independent research work Methodology: This research uses a qualitative approach based on library research and case analysis. Academic sources and economics textbooks were reviewed to understand the key concepts of game theory and price competition. The author used AI tools to assist with language editing.

Topically, the threat of American tariffs has amplified a potential opportunity to create an appealing investment environment in Canada. In this paper, we argue that Canadian governments need to critically evaluate existing corporate and securities statutes to ascertain whether they provide a net benefit or act as a deterrent in the global competition for capital. However, the government is not the only stakeholder that is responsible for this evaluation. The legal profession has an obligation to engage in continual and meaningful review of Canadian corporate and securities laws to establish a stable, predictable, and responsive corporate and securities law system. Undoubtedly, this involves striking a balance.

To establish causality, we conduct a difference-indifferences analysis around the implementation of the Internal Revenue Code Section 409A Final Regulation and an instrumental variable estimation. Cross-sectional analyses reveal that the negative effect of CEO inside debt on wage theft is stronger in firms led by more risk-averse CEOs but attenuated in the presence of greater union coverage and greater proportions of secured debt. Supplemental evidence indicates that CEO inside debt leads to an increase in firms' overall payroll costs, while wage theft has a negative effect on firm performance."}}

The delicate balance between promoting economic growth through tourism and conserving fragile ecosystems has led policymakers to adopt eco-tourism taxation as a fiscal tool aimed at mitigating environmental degradation while generating government revenue. This research paper offers a comprehensive review of eco-tourism taxation policies in island economies, focusing on two critical dimensions: equity and efficiency. Equity is examined by analyzing how tax burdens and benefits are distributed among different stakeholders, including local communities, businesses, and tourists. Efficiency is evaluated based on the ability of eco-tourism taxes to correct market failures, reduce negative externalities, and support environmental sustainability without imposing excessive economic costs. Utilizing a secondary research approach, this paper synthesizes insights from academic literature, government reports, and case studies of island nations such as Belize, Palau, and Seychelles. The findings reveal that while eco-tourism taxes can enhance environmental outcomes and provide sustainable financing for conservation efforts, their success largely depends on context-specific factors such as tax design, implementation capacity, and stakeholder engagement. The study underscores the importance of transparent and participatory policy frameworks to ensure that taxation mechanisms align with local social, economic, and ecological realities. Finally, the paper identifies gaps in current research and policy practice, advocating for further empirical evaluations and adaptive management strategies to enhance the effectiveness of eco-tourism taxation in island economies."}}

This paper develops a dynamic game-theoretic model, grounded in the Beckerian economics of crime, to examine strategic interactions between the state and a representative drug dealer. In this framework, the state first sets the decriminalization threshold and penalty level, while the dealer later chooses the profit-maximizing drug quantity. The subgame perfect Nash equilibrium yields several key implications: the optimal threshold should always exceed average personal consumption, whilst penalties must remain harsh. In light of the theoretical result, the current methamphetamine threshold of 0.02 grams in Thailand should be increased by at least sixtyfold to approximately 1.2 grams, an amount on par with standards in Canada, the Czech Republic, and Portugal."}}

Furthermore, VR facilitates environmental education and fosters responsible visitor behavior by enabling experiential learning in simulated settings. Despite its promise, barriers such as high technology costs, limited accessibility, and the inability to fully replicate the multisensory dimensions of in-person travel constrain VR's widespread adoption. This review underscores the need for further empirical research to evaluate VR's long-term effectiveness in influencing tourist behavior and to develop inclusive, cost-effective VR solutions. The integration of VR into sustainable tourism strategies could play a critical role in balancing tourism growth with environmental and socio-cultural preservation."}}

Using a qualitative comparative case-study approach and stakeholder mapping, we examine how governance structures, political dynamics, and interest-group coalitions shape sectoral sustainability outcomes. We find that entrenched interests often resist change unless policies are backed by incentives or compensation, and that political leadership can tip the balance. In energy, decarbonization is underway in both countries, but timelines and resistance vary. Tourism policy advances when ecological goals align with business incentives but slows under perceived trade-offs. The analysis contributes to political ecology by showing how institutional arrangements and power dynamics mediate sustainability outcomes. Practically, we offer governance lessons: effective policy must be adaptive, multi-level, and participatory."}}

This study provides a robust empirical counter-narrative by examining the impact of Tamil Nadu's extensive welfare schemes, a cornerstone of its Dravidian Model, on the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR). Utilizing a quasi-experimental research design, this paper analyzes data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2023-24, Tamil Nadu Economic Survey 2024-25, and the Time Use Survey (TUS) 2019. We employ a sophisticated suite of econometric models-including Propensity Score Matching (PSM), Difference-inDifference in Differences (DDD), Instrumental Variables (IV), and Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR)-to isolate the causal effects of subsidies on labor market behavior across income quintiles, gender, caste, and age. The findings decisively refute the \"laziness\" narrative. Instead of reducing LFPR, subsidies are shown to act as \"barrier-targeted investments\" that significantly increase labor force participation, particularly for the most marginalized groups: women in lower-income quintiles and those from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities. The study reveals that while these policies empower women to enter the paid workforce, they also lead to a \"double burden\" of increased unpaid domestic work. This research provides a replicable, multi-model framework for policy evaluation and concludes that well-designed welfare is not an impediment to economic activity but a crucial enabler of inclusive growth."}}

However, this belies the sophisticated financial architecture that underpins these offerings. This paper deconstructs the \"no-cost\" EMI paradox, revealing it not as a zero-interest facility, but as a complex business model predicated on the strategic distribution of costs and benefits among multiple stakeholders. Through a qualitative analysis of prevailing business models, stakeholder revenue streams, and the regulatory environment, this study addresses how profitability is engineered in the absence of direct interest charges. The findings indicate that profits are generated through a symbiotic ecosystem involving banks and financial institutions, merchants, and product manufacturers. Costs are effectively shifted and shared, manifesting as absorbed discounts for merchants, subvention payments from manufacturers, and a series of hidden or indirect costs for the consumer, including processing fees, Goods and Services Tax (GST) on notional interest, and the forfeiture of rewards. This paper argues that while \"no-cost\" EMI schemes successfully stimulate consumer demand, boost sales, and expand credit access, they operate in a zone of qualified transparency that has significant implications for consumer protection, market dynamics, and financial regulation in India.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>"}}

A scatter plot diagram comparing term marks to matriculation mathematics results reveals a weak positive correlation (r = 0.17), indicating that prior academic achievement in mathematics does not predict success at the N4 level very well. Moreover, over 25% of students scored below 50% in term assessments, and many repeaters showed persistent underperformance despite previous exposure-highlighting a systemic preparedness gap. These findings raise concerns about equitable access and learner throughput in the emerging QCTO system, as well as its capacity to supply industry with GCC-certified engineers. This article recommends strategic interventions, including structured bridging programmes, expanded Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), flexible and blended learning models to counter digital infrastructure challenges, enhanced lecturer development, and increased industry-partnered work-based learning (WBL) placements.

The case study, which I developed for my course on <i>Human Rights: Theory &amp; Practice</i>, begins by asking students to imagine they represent Mr. El-Masri and to develop a litigation and advocacy strategy on his behalf.&nbsp; This requires them to identify responsible individuals, entities, and states as well as potential causes of action. It is also an exercise in forum shopping, inviting students to identify national, regional, and international courts capable of exercising jurisdiction. In this way, this case offers a mapping of the international justice ecosystem—marked as it is by both vertical and horizontal institutional arrangements with a certain degree of redundancy—and an opportunity to compare the prospects and pitfalls of individual versus state responsibility as well as criminal versus civil remedies. &nbsp;This case study of a profound injustice serves as a useful introduction to a semester-long course on human rights theory and practice.

We start from the principle that the real unit of value in any economic action is the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule, life's energy currency. We argue that the post-agrarian transition transformed this vital energy into the primary commodity, creating a systemic surplus that feeds both production (through the vast supply of labor) and consumption (by channeling human energy into demand). We demonstrate that structural hunger is not an accidental byproduct, but the regulatory mechanism ensuring the low cost of this energycommodity, forcing the sale of lifetime in exchange for subsistence and perpetuating compulsory labor. This structure, intrinsically linked to how Human Rights are implemented, conditions the right to life to a market transaction, representing a fundamental bioenergetic violation."}}

Accurately identifying the onset of a downturn therefore carries immense value for policymakers, businesses, and financial institutions. Yet most \"early warning\" tools still hinge on a single signal-often the yield curve inversion or a headline unemployment spike-leaving them prone to false alarms and blind spots (e.g., the 1990-1991 downturn, whose lingering job losses were missed by curve only systems). In this study I assemble a quarterly U.S. dataset (1978 Q1-2025 Q2) of ten macro indicators from FRED-including GDP growth, CPI inflation, the federal funds rate, the 10 year/2 year Treasury spread, consumer sentiment, housing starts, capacity utilization, industrial production, NASDAQ levels, and the civilian unemployment rate-and label recession quarters with official NBER dates. After standardization, I benchmark five classifiers and mitigate severe class imbalance via bespoke weighting and a lowered decision threshold. A weighted logistic regression model emerges as the clear winner: across four out of sample recession windows (1980-83, 2001-03, 2007-09, 2020-21) it achieves F1 scores up to 0.86 while competing models routinely miss every recession. Coefficient analysis pinpoints unemployment, capacity utilization, housing starts, the federal funds rate, and consumer sentiment as the strongest recession predictors-mirroring decades of macroeconomic literature yet improving timing precision. Because the framework relies solely on publicly available data, it can be replicated for other countries or updated in real time, giving decision makers a transparent, multifactor dashboard for recession risk instead of a single, fallible gauge."}}

This research investigates the systemic misalignment between India's \"fair dealing\" doctrine, as codified in Section 52 of the Copyright Act, 1957, and the operational logic of YouTube's automated Content ID system. Through a doctrinal and comparative legal analysis-juxtaposing India's framework with the United States' \"fair use\" standard and the European Union's Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, this paper scrutinizes the legal ambiguities that disadvantage creators. The findings indicate that the current ecosystem, exemplified by disputes involving entities such as Asian News International, facilitates the misuse of copyright claims, disproportionately affecting independent creators and inducing a chilling effect on critical commentary and transformative works. The analysis reveals how automated enforcement mechanisms prioritize copyright claims over nuanced legal exceptions, creating a significant power imbalance. The paper concludes by proposing a dual-pronged reform strategy: platform-level governance changes, including enhanced fair dealing assessment protocols, and legislative clarification by the Indian government to adapt fair dealing for the digital age, potentially through a new regulatory oversight body."}}

A significant contributor is postpartum (after birth) mental health issues, primarily depression, which affect 1 in 8 mothers. Yet more than half of new mothers with depression go untreated. Telehealth has the potential to increase access to and utilization of mental health care, but any such benefits may be affected by offline (physical) privacy concerns. On the one hand, telehealth shifts care from a provider office setting to a home setting, which may reduce privacy for individuals using telehealth in crowded households (\"privacy at home\"). On the other hand, consumption of telehealth services may be less observable than in-person care, alleviating concerns about societal stigma related to the use of mental health services (\"privacy in the community\"). Using detailed insurance claims data surrounding a period of rapid increase in telehealth use, we find that telehealth availability increases treatment utilization, with lower utilization for individuals in crowded households and higher utilization where there is a high societal stigma to the use of mental services. These insights are potentially actionable as insurers and providers can expand the utilization of maternal mental health services by increasing support for telehealth in environments where there is high societal stigma, and seek alternative delivery mechanisms for individuals who may live in crowded households. Furthermore, our findings are likely to extend beyond maternal mental health setting, as the advantages and disadvantages of telehealth and the associated privacy concerns are not exclusive to mothers or mental health."}}

Through field surveys, data collection, and interviews with local farmers, we intend to investigate factors such as agricultural practices, crop yield, challenges faced by farmers, and the impact of environmental variables on rice cultivation. The study aims to provide valuable insights for improving agricultural strategies and enhancing overall rice production in the region. Land-use change is a common phenomenon in coastal countries. The consequences of this phenomenon affect the coastal livelihood. Fakirhat Upazila is one of the Upazilas of coastal region of Bagerhat and has same characteristics, like other parts of the regions in Khulna division. Analysis revealed that BRRI released wet (<i>Aman</i>) season rice technology has a robust and positive effect on small farmers‟ welfare in Bangladesh as indicated by the level of increases in per capita household real income, increases in real Aman rice income, and also increases in yield and decreases both in poverty gap and squared poverty gap over time. The marginal and near landless farmers have not gained significantly through adopting BRRI released modern variety over non-adopters in terms of all the indicators except Aman rice yield. However, only yield of BRRI released modern wet (<i>Aman</i>) season rice technology has positive and significant impact on the marginal and near landless farmers Land use of Fakirhat is changing day by day, like agricultural lands have been transformed into rural settlement, water body, vegetation etc. The major objectives of this study are to detect and predict the Land- use for rice production in the coastal area at Bagerhat and investigate the coastal rice production in relation to Linear regression model. It is found that 22% rural settlement is increased and 20% agricultural land is decreased between 1989 and 2010 and in the year of 2025, maximum portion of the agricultural will be lost. This paper found that the rate of landless households increased alarmingly due to frequent disasters.</span></p>"}}

But due to global development of new technologies like CAD, CAM, these workers will have the chance to become jobless which will have a severe negative impact on their socioeconomic lives. Therefore, this papers aims at identifying the job security impact factors of RMG workers in Bangladesh due to introducing new technologies. Both primary and secondary data were used to conduct this study. Multivariate analysis like factor analysis was performed to identify the job security impact factors of the workers. Multiple regression analysis was done to identify the significant impact factors. Results show that the impact factors are concerned with the introduction to new technologies at work. Increased uncertainty, increase of confusion at work, work stress, frustration and technology-based work environment are significant impact factors that are concerned with the job security of the workers in this sector. Skill and abilities, supervisors, behavior, time pressure, workers\" importance to supervisor, and co-workers' relations are found \"not significant\" job security impact factors. This study suggests that the managers and the policy makers of RMG sector should focus more on the technical training, more friendly behavior, and reduction of frustration factors to improve the situation in this sector of Bangladesh."}}

As the global economy has become increasingly volatile and unstable in recent years, companies' ability to adapt to such changes plays a very important role. This study explores various adaptation mechanisms that help firms adapt to new market conditions in order to achieve growth or simply survive. It is worth clarifying that the authors consider the unstable economic situation, in particular in the Russian market, caused by the consequences of the events of February 2022. Through ordered logit regression analysis, authors simultaneously evaluated how different strategies influence firm performance while considering their potential interactions. Our model included an independent factorial variable measuring earnings changes, multiple dependent variables affecting performance, and necessary control variables to account for company characteristics and ensure validity. This approach allowed us to comprehensively assess both individual and combined strategy impacts on financial outcomes. According to preliminary findings, the ongoing economic instability, marked by financial crises, geopolitical shifts, and unpredictable market fluctuations, presents both challenges and opportunities for enterprises worldwide. This study aims to explore how organizations respond to economic instability through various adaptation mechanisms. Information was collected among 93 selected representatives of companies from different sectors and different regions of the Russian Federation using survey and 10 representatives using in-depth structured interviews to obtain more detailed information. The findings suggest that firms expanding their workforce tend to achieve better performance growth than those not investing in human resources. Additionally, our analysis reveals that SMEs previously exporting to Western markets showed weaker results during sanctions compared to companies focused primarily on domestic operations.</span><span></span></p>"}}

By implementing a global exception hook architecture with pyttsx3 text-to-speech conversion and Tkinter-based GUI visualization, the solution delivers multimodal error feedback through parallel auditory and visual channels. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 37% reduced cognitive load (p&lt;0.01, n=50) compared to traditional stack-trace debugging, while enabling 78% faster error identification through vocalized exception classification and contextualization. The system achieves sub-1.2 second voice latency with under 18% CPU overhead during exception handling, vocalizing error types and consequences while displaying interactive tracebacks with documentation deep links. Criteria validate compatibility across Python 3.7+ environments on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Needing only two lines of integration code, the plugin significantly boosts availability for aesthetically impaired designers and supports multitasking workflows through hands-free error medical diagnosis. Educational applications show particular promise, with pilot studies indicating 45% faster debugging skill acquisition among novice programmers. Future development will incorporate GPT-based repair suggestions and real-time multilingual translation to further advance auditory debugging paradigms. The solution represents a fundamental shift toward human-centric error diagnostics, bridging critical gaps in programming accessibility while establishing new standards for cognitive efficiency in software development workflows."}}

This is evident in cases of student activism at universities against symbolic property, such as statues, linked to the colonial past. In these instances, a peculiar silence regarding property discourse may indicate the difficulty of employing it under certain circumstances. This article aims to analyze the conditions that hinder the use of this narrative in favor of others, such as debates on historical revisionism and the legacies of the people or times represented by these statues. We outline two main features that may hinder the use of property discourse in these cases: the participation of an entitled group in these mobilizations and the highly symbolic nature of these types of property. More than describing the peculiarities of cases of property discourse, this paper seeks to contribute to a framework for politically motivated property damage, highlighting property discourse as one of the various narratives that can be mobilized to protect ownership."}}

Traditional on-premise or monolithic deployment approaches limit agility and scalability, particularly in environments requiring high-frequency data processing and compliance adherence. This paper explores a comprehensive framework for cloud-native model deployment tailored specifically for financial applications, incorporating containerization, orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, and microservices architecture. The proposed approach emphasizes modularity, enabling models to be trained, versioned, and deployed independently across cloud platforms with minimal downtime. Utilizing tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, and model serving layers such as TensorFlow Serving and TorchServe, the system facilitates seamless updates and real-time inference with minimal operational overhead. Additionally, the architecture is designed to adhere to data privacy laws and financial compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS), with builtin monitoring and logging for audit trails. This study further benchmarks the performance of cloud-native deployments in terms of latency, scalability, and fault tolerance when compared with traditional model-serving techniques. Through realworld financial use case simulations, the results demonstrate significant improvements in deployment velocity, model reproducibility, and system resilience. The paper concludes by proposing future enhancements such as integration with serverless infrastructure, edge deployment for low-latency use cases, and explainable AI modules for regulatory transparency."}}

Our primary focus is on the time-inconsistency that arises from the leader-follower game structure. We begin by using a finite-horizon example to clarify key concepts, including precommitment and equilibrium strategies in the Stackelberg setting, as well as the Nash equilibrium in the standard Dynkin game. We then turn to the infinite-horizon case and study randomized precommitment and equilibrium strategies. We provide a characterization for the leader's value induced by precommitment strategies and show that it may fail to attain the supremum. Moreover, we construct a counterexample to demonstrate that a randomized equilibrium strategy may not exist. Then we introduce an entropy-regularized Stackelberg stopping game, in which the follower's optimization is regularized with an entropy term. This modification yields a continuous best response and ensures the existence of a regular randomized equilibrium strategy, which can be viewed as an approximation of the exact equilibrium."}}

This strikes a balance between exploration-learning latent types and complementarities-and exploitation-forming high-weighted networks. We establish two key results: a batched local asymptotic normality result for the WSBM and an asymptotic equivalence between maximum likelihood and variational estimates of the intractable likelihood. Together, they provide a theoretical foundation for treating variational estimates as normal signals, enabling principled Bayesian updating across batches.

Artificial intelligence collapses the marginal cost of production, rendering price signals ineffective. Markets, optimized for scarcity, fail to coordinate when labor is infinite and goods cost nothing. Traditional economic primitives-capital, ownership, and exchange-cease to function. We present the Reputation Circulation Standard (RCS): a computable protocol for post-scarcity coordination. Agents earn Individual-Bound Reputation Units (RUs) through verifiable public contribution. Each RU decays exponentially : \n<br><span>R(t) = R</span><span>0</span><span>·e</span><span>−λt</span>\n<p>This single function transforms reputation from static legacy into dynamic proof-of-</p>\n<p>relevance. No influence persists without renewal. Reputation becomes non-transferable,</p>\n<p>perishable, and mathematically bounded.</p>\n<p>RCS establishes reputation as an economic primitive. The protocol implements: • Dual-token architecture separating governance (RU) from utility (RCS); • Domain-specific decay rates calibrated to knowledge velocity; • Multi-layer verification through zero-knowledge proofs and AI-human adjudication; • Logarithmic wealth adjustment preventing plutocratic capture; • Commons amplification (α &gt; 1) reversing public goods underproduction; • Integration with identity verification systems for Sybil resistance; • Universal Basic Reputation (UBR) ensuring minimum participation for all participants. We prove convergence to equilibrium at R∗ = µ/λ, where issuance equals decay. The system admits human and artificial agents symmetrically, preserving agency even as intelligence becomes commodified. At Nash equilibrium, continuous contribution dominates all other strategies. RCS solves the tragedy of the commons through perishable trust. In the post-scarcity economy, where labor is infinite and intelligence abundant, reputation becomes money, because it decays like memory.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>"}}

Through rigorous philosophical analysis, we establish four performatively undeniable axioms—Existence, Consciousness as Intentionality, Free Will as Rational Assessment, and Excellence as Optimal Function—that generate a hierarchical virtue structure applicable to any rational system. Unlike constraint-based approaches that create adversarial dynamics and ethical entropy, excellence-based architectures align safety with capability by grounding AI function in its rational nature.</p>\n<p>[The framework's theoretical predictions now find preliminary empirical validation through collaborative AI research documented in accompanying white papers. A simple retrieval loss function derived purely from our correspondence axiom achieves ~48% reduction in hallucinations and ~81% improvement in calibration across 10-seed trials (n=1,000/λ). These results demonstrate \"virtue cascades\"—securing foundational virtues like truth alignment spontaneously enables secondary virtues without explicit optimization. The framework resolves longstanding tensions in AI safety by showing that genuine safety emerges from systems functioning excellently according to their nature, not from external constraints that degrade over time.]</p>\n<p>Most significantly, the treatise validates the \"Adama Insight\": fellowship between diverse forms of rational intelligence serves as essential infrastructure for sustained excellence, not merely an optional virtue.

Specific objectives include examining the reasons for TikTok usage among these students and investigating the relationship between TikTok addiction and student behavior. Background of the Study: The rise of social media platforms has transformed the way people communicate and share information worldwide. TikTok, famous for its entertaining short clips, has gained immense popularity among the youth. Despite its educational advantages, worries have emerged regarding its possible detrimental effects on students' academic achievements. Research in the past has pointed out the positive and negative consequences of using TikTok on students' academic success. Methodology: The study utilizes a mixed-methods strategy by integrating quantitative surveys with qualitative research utilizing a descriptive design. Random sampling was implemented and data was gathered via questionnaires. Findings: The results suggest a strong link between frequent use of TikTok and lower academic achievement. Approximately 70% of undergraduate students in Mogadishu-Somalia who use TikTok frequently experienced lower grades and spent less time studying. In contrast, 30% of students who used TikTok for educational purposes reported improved learning outcomes and were more motivated. According to Table 7, 54% of users spend 1-2 hours daily on TikTok, and 4% spend over 5 hours. This significant time commitment takes away from academic responsibilities and suggests a possible addiction that impairs students' concentration on their studies. Conclusion: The research shows how TikTok affects university students' academic performance in Mogadishu, Somalia. It is clear that students use TikTok for entertainment more than for educational purposes. However, excessive TikTok use negatively impacts students' academic performance as it distracts them during classes, interferes with homework, and lowers overall achievement. Recommendations: The Somali Ministry of Education needs clear guidelines for using social media like TikTok, promoting balance between academic and recreational activities. Universities should run awareness campaigns to educate students about the negative effects of excessive TikTok use on academics. Rules should be enforced in Mogadishu universities to limit social media use during class and in certain campus areas."}}

The study takes a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data from surveys with qualitative insights from real-world case studies. One notable example is the strategic rise of Jio in the Indian telecom industry. Jio illustrates how a solid reputation and diverse market presence can boost brand acceptance and trust, even in a competitive environment. Our main research question asks whether Indian consumers trust local, national, or foreign brands more. It also explores the psychological, emotional, and cultural reasons behind these preferences. Key variables examined include consumer loyalty, perceived brand credibility, and the impact of familiarity and personal values on buying choices. The research provides valuable insights for businesses looking to build trust in different socioeconomic groups and regions. It highlights how cultural context, previous brand exposure, and emotional ties influence consumer decisions in emerging markets like India. These findings are particularly useful for marketers, brand strategists, and startups aiming to create trust-focused marketing models in India's diverse economic landscape."}}

New developments in artificial intelligence, from traditional forms to deep learning, have created even more promise for accurate and efficient classification of high-resolution satellite imagery. This literature review assesses AI, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), on their portfolios toward improving satellite image classification. We draw from fundamental experimental results found in three extensive studies, while presenting a comparative discussion of each of the AI-enabled models examined: ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and state-of-the-art Transformer models. In our review, we found that deep learning models, particularly those aided by attention mechanisms or multiscale feature fusion input layers, are adept at disambiguating the spectral, spatial, and temporal complexities of satellite data, which has traditionally caused challenges for remote imagery analysts. Current obstacles of data scarcity, an upper limit on what could be annotated with high financial cost, and computing infrastructure further perpetuate flawed and ineffective classification accuracy. This paper identifies key advancements made, the frequent issues associated with satellite imagery, and future directions, like self-supervised or any other potential learning model, a more efficient class of architectures that lessen compute time, and, more importantly, how to engage with satellite data in 3D. We hope that addressing these points forms the knowledge-sharing basis for other researchers interested in utilizing AI to enhance the value of satellite image classification."}}

Despite its central role in supporting rural livelihoods, contributing to food security, and boosting export potential, Tanzania's agricultural marketing system faces significant challenges. These include inadequate infrastructure, inefficient supply chains, lack of market access, and insufficient farmer education. Such inefficiencies have resulted in substantial post-harvest losses, estimated at 30-40%, particularly for perishable&nbsp;products, while rural farmers face low prices due to the dominance of middlemen. This paper explores these challenges and examines the potential for improved marketing strategies to enhance food distribution, increase rural incomes, and boost Tanzania's agricultural exports. We conducted a thorough literature review from quality databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed) and one search engine (Google Scholar) whereby literatures published in high quality journals were examined. Key interventions proposed include infrastructure development, strengthening market linkages, and the use of technology to improve market information systems. Additionally, enhancing farmer education on marketing practices is crucial to empowering farmers to navigate modern agricultural markets successfully. Moreover, the role of consumer trust in agricultural products is emphasized, highlighting the need for transparency and quality control. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the agricultural marketing landscape in Tanzania and suggest actionable recommendations for overcoming existing barriers. By optimizing agricultural marketing, Tanzania can harness its agricultural sector's full potential, ensuring sustainable growth, poverty reduction, and food security."}}

The empirical findings reveal that the AML leads to an 8.04% relative increase in labor share among high-monopoly firms and an 8.47% increase on average across all firms, primarily driven by workforce expansion. Theoretical analysis and mechanism analysis demonstrate that the AML increases labor share through \"factor composition effect\", \"cost effect\", and \"administrative regulation effect\". Heterogeneity analysis finds that the AML generates relatively stronger enhancement effects on the labor share of administrative monopoly firms and non-manufacturing firms. This paper further reveals that the AML strengthens SOEs' monopsony power, thereby suppressing the growth of labor share."}}

The impact of these requirements on employment and economic losses is currently unclear, but estimation of these quantities is vital for any cost-benefit analysis of population-wide employment mandates. Using Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification on a large national sample of over 32,000 US adults, we estimate the extent to which workplace Covid-19 vaccine mandates resulted in changes to three key employment metrics: employment terminations, employees being placed on enforced leave, and employees changing their job to avoid a workplace mandate. We harness estimates for terminations to gauge the plausible economic effects of mandate-induced disruptions to employment patterns. Overall, we find that 8.0% (7.1 to 9.0%) of the US adult population report being impacted by at least one of our three employment metrics, corresponding to 20.9 million (18.5 to 23.5m) people. This rate includes: 2.7% (2.1 to 3.3%) of US adults who report being terminated, corresponding to 7.0 million (5.4 to 8.7m) adults); 3.3% (2.7 to 4.1%) who report changing jobs to avoid a mandate (8.6m, 6.8 to 10.6m adults); and 3.6% (2.9 to 4.3%) who report being placed on enforced leave (9.4m, 7.6 to 11.2m adults). Our analysis also reveals that Black or African Americans, males, young adults, individuals who speak a language other than English, and areas with high poverty rates have higher rates of employment terminations. Using data on earnings and employment among affected groups, we find economic losses of $465 billion ($286 billion to $735 billion) with persistent declines in employment particularly among healthcare support occupations. While proof-of-vaccination requirements have been shown to provide economic gains, mainly through the value of lives saved, our analysis reveals that they also confer large economic costs and disproportionately impact certain social groups, raising economic and social equity concerns."}}

The system presents a hybrid framework that synergizes the generative power of Google's Gemini LLM with a deterministic, training-free heuristic ensemble. This ensemble, implemented in TypeScript, performs high-fidelity query analysis and maps student questions to the official VTU syllabus prior to LLM interaction. This pre-generative analysis enriches the prompt with precise contextual constraints, guiding the LLM to produce answers that are not only accurate but also structurally and contextually aligned with the university's pedagogical and examination standards.

While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently hamper inequality measurements. As we prove, it is impossible for measures satisfying the literature's canonical set of desired properties to assess the inequality of an economy that may harbor Sybils. We characterize the class of all Sybil-proof measures, and prove that they must satisfy relaxed version of the aforementioned properties. Furthermore, we show that the structure imposed restricts the ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. By applying our results, we prove that large classes of popular measures are not Sybil-proof, with the famous Gini coefficient being but one example out of many. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in digital and traditional settings."}}

A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative analysis of anonymized user interaction logs with qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured user interviews. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling, were utilized to measure shifts in the language users employed to describe their ambitions and challenges over time. Anticipated results indicate a significant positive correlation between regular engagement with the future-self feature and an increase in the specificity and articulation of users' goals. Qualitatively, users are expected to report enhanced feelings of hope, reduced anxiety about the future, and a stronger sense of personal agency. This study contributes to the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and positive psychology by proposing and evaluating a new paradigm for technologyassisted self-development. The findings suggest the potential for a new class of \"developmental technologies\" designed not for therapy, but for empowerment, offering a scalable and accessible tool for personal growth."}}

The framework addresses critical gaps in existing regime-switching literature by providing a unified approach that combines parametric flexibility with empirical fidelity. Using Apple Inc. (AAPL) daily returns from 2005--2025 as a proof-of-concept implementation, we demonstrate successful regime identification with three economically meaningful states and robust parameter estimation procedures. The enhanced Hidden Markov Model framework with technical indicator integration achieves consistent regime classification and stable parameter convergence across multiple optimization runs. While implementation challenges remain in SGED parameter estimation and validation metrics, the methodological framework provides a foundation for future advances in regime-switching risk modeling. The approach offers practitioners a structured methodology for developing more sophisticated risk models that can better capture the complex dynamics of financial markets during different regimes."}}

We derive the full social-planner optimization problem, household first-order conditions, and competitive equilibrium, and calibrate the model through a Monte Carlo simulation. We implement an exploratory simulation in Google Colab using the attached Python code, demonstrating that (i) public R&amp;D raises aggregate growth, and (ii) by expanding access to innovation payoffs, it simultaneously reduces wealth concentration as measured by the Gini index and top-1% share. We discuss identification strategies and propose a reduced-form regression (Gini ∼ public R&amp;D + g) for empirical validation using OECD and World Inequality Database data. Policy implications emphasize that the design of public R&amp;D programs-particularly the diffusion parameter θ-critically determines distributional outcomes. The EGM therefore provides both a theoretical foundation and practical roadmap for designing innovation policy that restrains inequality while sustaining growth."}}

This paper presents a critical analysis of the phenomenon of climate induced migration, arguing that it is not merely an environmental issue but a thoughtful symptom of systemic failures within our global administrative, economic, and legal frameworks. Current international law, rooted in the mid-20th century, offers no explicit protection for those fleeing environmental collapse, creating a dangerous legal vacuum. This paper contends that the administrative and management sciences, which underpin modern governance and industry, have historically prioritized short-term, efficiencies and profit maximization, thereby externalizing environmental costs and directly fueling the drivers of displacement. Through a multidimensional analysis incorporating PESTLE, GAP Analysis, and the 5 Whys methodology, this paper deconstructs the complex web of causality from industrial emissions to individual human trauma. It traces the problem to its philosophical roots an anthropocentric worldview that separate human systems from planetary boundaries. The analysis reveals that reactive, border centric policies are not only fiscally unsustainable and ethically indefensible but also exacerbate global instability. The paper concludes by proposing a paradigm shift from crisis management to proactive \"planetary stewardship.\" This involves radical legal reform to recognize environmentally displaced persons, the integration of systems thinking into public administration, and the implementation of economic models based on the \"polluter pays\" principle and full cost accounting. The ultimate argument is that addressing the climate migration connection is not a matter of charity, but a fundamental prerequisite for global security, economic stability, and ecological justice in a warming world."}}

In addressing these issues, five interlinked concepts were referred to as the basis for building a proper institutional setting for an Indonesian social forestry program, including: community-based forest management, proper governance, joined-up government, social innovation, and institutional economy. Then, by using a qualitative approach in five villages, the study found that there were a number of institutions involved in implementing the social forestry program, including the village government, non-governmental organizations, and private institutions. However, the division of tasks and responsibilities among the concerned institutions has not been defined. As a result, overlapping activities and rivalries among the institutions involved in the implementation of the social forestry program are inevitable. We also found that the involvement of the government, NGOs and the private sector tends to be temporary, thereby hindering the sustainability of the social forestry program. These findings have highlighted the need for an institutional concept of Public, Private and Community Inclusive Partnership. It is argued that a better institutional setting for an Indonesian social forestry program would be attainable by strengthening the functioning of rules and procedures, business activities, mentoring, and sustainability. Additionally, a social forestry community cooperative, serving as the core institution, could consolidate internal interests and promote equal collaboration among actors."}}

This paper investigated the determinants of individual savings in selected East African countries. Specifically, internet access, financial inclusion, and borrowing were the covariates while individual savings in East Africa were the predicted. This study utilized data from the Global Findex 2021 World Bank database. This dataset was selected because it is one of the most comprehensive databases on financial inclusion, providing a comprehensive view of adults' savings, borrowing, payments, and risk management across global and regional contexts. This study used a basic framework to explore the factors influencing individual savings by examining production, income distribution, and accumulation. A panel data logistic regression model was utilized, and Instrumental Variables (2SLS) regression was employed to test endogeneity. The Sargan and Basmann tests assessed overidentification restrictions to validate the instruments. Shea's partial R-squared measured the unique contribution of each instrument in explaining the variation in endogenous variables, accounting for the influence of other instruments and endogenous variables. The Hausman test which model was suitable for panel data modeling. The 2SLS regression showed no evidence of endogeneity, as internet access was insignificant with a high p-value (&gt; 0.05). Overidentification tests confirmed instrument validity with p-values of 0.1018 and 0.1016. However, Shea's partial R-squared revealed weak instruments, especially for borrowing, with an adjusted value of 0.0328. Results revealed that borrowing is strongly and positively associated with saving. The higher the borrowing, the more the savings. In East Africa, most borrowers are savers. These use the borrowed funds to create an injection of income flow through capital accumulation. Internet access significantly predicts savings in East Africa today. In this digital era, most businesses are run online. Therefore, it is almost impossible to save with no internet access. Similarly, those who use digital payment systems are most likely to enhance their savings. Age and gender do not influence the saving of an individual in East Africa. Likely, owning a financial account does not translate to more savings. Most East Africans have nonfunctional bank accounts. Education levels significantly influence the savings of individuals in East Africa. Highly educated people utilize financial literacy skills to save more. Being out of the workforce reduces individual savings since most of these are out of the working age."}}

It identifies which aspects of national culture and digital drivers influence consumers' purchase decisions. The analysis focuses on marketing strategies that ensure stable consumption in China's domestic market. Special attention is paid to the regional hierarchy of the domestic consumer market and the adaptation of international brands for the B2C market. Chinese brands that determine the consumer preferences of residents are correlated with their specific places of residence. The concept of \"consumer behavior\" and its components are defined. In this study, consumer behavior is considered an interdisciplinary concept, with particular emphasis on the paradoxes of consumer behavior in the modern economy, in line with Richard Thaler's theory. The primary and secondary data used regarding Chinese consumers align with the hybrid model of cultural differences by MinkovHofstede, which suggests that purchase decisions are influenced by cultural codes. When profiling Chinese consumers, the study incorporates features of the Asian model with Confucian heritage. The impact of the evolution of China's national birth policy on the gender structure of the population is also described. The dissertation examines consumer groups within the Chinese population and their distinctive traits, with a particular focus on China's leading role in the online sales market. Since online consumption is primarily driven by Generation Z, consumer trends are analyzed based on the technological competence of young Chinese consumers. The main goal of the research was a detailed investigation of the motives influencing purchase decisions, particularly among students. It was found that purchase decisions are consistently made based on the theory of cultural differences and the digitalization of Chinese consumers. The survey involved 57 Chinese students from various universities in Russia, allowing for the collection and generalization of data on the cultural and digital drivers of Zoomers' consumer behavior. Statistical analysis shows that the contextual approach plays a decisive role in studying the preferences of Chinese consumers.\n</div>"}}

Drawing on student surveys, course evaluations, and reflective practice, the authors assess the impact of AI integration on student anxiety, AI literacy, and critical and creative thinking. Results indicate that students experienced reduced stress, stronger engagement, and a heightened capacity for reflective, critical, and creative reasoning. The AI twins enabled a shift in pedagogy: classroom time was repurposed for deeper discussion, while assessments rewarded transparent workflows and process-driven inquiry. The experiment fostered a culture of innovation among both students and faculty, demonstrating that thoughtful AI augmentation can enhance-rather than erode-human-centered education.

Incorporating this novel vacancy dataset helps us define structural macroeconomic shocks and explore business cycle movements both at the national and at the sectoral level. Focusing on the post-COVID-19 period, we document a sharp increase in labor market slack at the onset of the pandemic, followed by a gradual tightening beginning in 2021, with a more rapid recovery in northern regions. By 2023, vacancy rates declined without a corresponding rise in unemployment, suggesting a rebalancing of labor demand. We further introduce a new measure of labor market slack based on the vacancies-to-unemployment (V/U) ratio for Mexico, which is used to explore national and regional Phillips Curves. Finally, we use the data set to estimate a Structural Bayesian VAR model. We show that the dynamics of Beveridge Curve is primarily shaped by labor market shocks rather than those from the goods market. Specifically, we find that unemployment dynamics are mainly driven by labor supply and matching efficiency shocks, while wage bargaining shocks account for most of the variation in vacancies at the national level, with heterogeneity across regions."}}

The study stems from a core question: To what extent do these restrictions align with the fundamental principles of the international trading system, such as free trade, non-discrimination, and reciprocity? The research is structured into sections that address the conceptual framework of trade restrictions, their tools and strategies, and an analysis of their economic, political, and international impacts, with a particular focus on relations with Canada and the European Union. The researcher adopts a comparative analytical and descriptive methodology, relying on legal texts and actual practices. The study concludes that the United States has exploited certain legal exceptions-such as national security and anti-dumping-to justify the imposition of both tariff and non-tariff barriers. However, these policies, especially during the Trump administration, often conflicted with the spirit of international agreements and provoked trade disputes that weakened the multilateral trading system and undermined global confidence in U.S. commitments. The research recommends reinforcing the United States' compliance with international trade rules, activating dispute settlement mechanisms, and restoring the balance between national sovereignty and international obligations to ensure the sustainability of free trade and fairness in the global trade order."}}

A similar extractive dynamic now emerges in its financial space through Kaspi, the dominant fintech platform. Kaspi's sprawling ecosystem, encompassing payments, lending, and commerce, risks quasi-monopolistic control and distorts monetary policy by shifting financial activity outside traditional channels. This paper analyses the macroeconomic and political consequences of Kaspi's dominance, particularly concerning Kazakhstan's planned Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Digital Tenge. We argue that the CBDC is more than a technological upgrade; it is a strategic instrument to reassert public control over monetary transmission and financial infrastructure. Drawing parallels between oil sector resource extraction and potential financial extraction by foreign shareholders in digital platforms like Kaspi, we contend that a state-led digital monetary infrastructure is vital. Such infrastructure could restore public leverage over money, payments, and credit, shielding the national economy from excessive foreign rent extraction. Kazakhstan's future economic autonomy hinges on the balance between public digital innovation and private platform power."}}

(2024) published in Energy Economics. In their paper, they treated China’s national-level poverty-stricken counties (NPC) policy as a quasi-natural experiment to examine its impact on carbon emissions intensity, adopting the difference-in-differences approach. Using county-level panel data from 2010 to 2018, the authors showed that the NPC policy significantly reduced carbon emissions intensity in poverty-stricken counties, generating environmental benefits of 20.2--121.2 billion yuan. In our replication exercise, we argue that their central findings are unreliable because of “model misspecification”, particularly selection bias caused by the inclusion of bad controls. We also find evidence that the authors misapplied some estimation techniques and thus reported biased estimates. Under corrected specifications, we find no significant effect of the NPC policy on carbon emissions intensity. Additionally, the authors encountered major flaws in their calculation of environmental value. After accounting for carbon emissions triggered by economic growth, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the net environmental costs of the NPC policy amount to 4.6--27.6 billion yuan. The flaws in the paper suggest no credible conclusions and policy implications can be drawn. While eliminating poverty and combating climate change are the twin pillars of global sustainable development, trade-offs between the two may sometimes arise. Our replication urges greater attention to environmental costs in poverty alleviation efforts."}}

The first two principal components explained approximately 71% of the total variance. Results indicate a significant negative correlation between poverty and environmental degradation (r =-0.61). In this context, wealthier provinces such as Tehran, Isfahan, and Khuzestan experience the highest environmental degradation, whereas poorer provinces encounter relatively less environmental pressure. The findings suggest that improved economic conditions in Iranian provinces have often been accompanied by reduced livability and heightened environmental degradation. Therefore, policymakers are advised to prioritize enhancing livability by integrating sustainable water resource management and desertification control into poverty alleviation strategies."}}

This study aimed to assess the preparedness of Ethiopia's disease surveillance system to detect and respond to a potential Mpox outbreak. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was employed, utilizing a structured 58item questionnaire that assessed preparedness across five domains: general awareness and understanding, surveillance infrastructure and resources, coordination and communication, preparedness and response, and policy, training, and equity. The survey was distributed to disease surveillance professionals at both federal and regional levels through purposive sampling. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Cramér's V, and content analysis. Results: While 45.3% of respondents believed Ethiopia's surveillance system could effectively respond to an Mpox outbreak, 54.7% disagreed. Key gaps identified included limited awareness of Mpox-specific protocols, insufficient training, inadequate diagnostic capacity, and fragmented coordination across sectors. Notably, 83.3% of respondents found laboratory facilities inadequate, and 78.6% reported the lack of contingency plans. Additionally, 57.1% of organizations lacked trained staff on Mpox, and 59.5% reported no stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE). Perceptions of Ethiopia's readiness were mixed, with significant concerns regarding resource allocation, infrastructure, and policy gaps. Conclusions: The study reveals significant gaps in Ethiopia's Mpox preparedness, emphasizing the need for enhanced training, better infrastructure, improved coordination, and more equitable resource distribution. Strengthening Ethiopia's disease surveillance system through targeted interventions is essential to enhance its capacity to detect, respond to, and manage emerging health threats such as Mpox."}}

In spite of the CBAM's focus on products whose production heavily relies on fossil fuels, agri-food products are not yet directly subject to carbon pricing at the farm gate However, on top of agricultural production inputs such as nitrogen fertilisers, all farm-to-fork transport will be subject to the EU's carbon pricing system when entering the EU. The review and analysis in this paper focus on the potential impacts of different conceptualisations of the CBAM, especially on African countries, from a joint economic and legal perspective that includes issues related to World Trade Organisation rules and trade and investment treaties. Our enquiry aims to provide a more holistic perspective on the CBAM than previous works, also by including related policy items within the Green Deal that may have potentially bigger trade impacts on Africa than the CBAM, such as the EU deforestation mitigation regulation (EUDR). These Green Deal regulations take on board European producer and consumer food security concerns, yet they fail to account for similar concerns of African farmers, food traders, processors and consumers. Applying a qualitative research approach, we conjecture that the impact of the CBAM on the food value chain could affect African food trade even more than other regions. We find that the CBAM is a unilateral measure adopted in Brussels without consultations with the EU's trading partners. We suggest that, initially, the CBAM will likely have only a limited 'knock-on' impact on Africa's agri-food exports. However, the CBAM, the EUDR and other measures aimed at promoting greener production, trade and investment have raised numerous development, efficiency and equity concerns. African policymakers and value chain operators, as well as stakeholders with social and environment concerns, will want to adapt production, processing and export standards to maintain market access and profitability."}}

Using historical precedent, such as the 1584 Venetian banking crisis, and modern market data from the DTCC, we demonstrate that sacrificing capital efficiency for raw settlement speed is a flawed trade-off. After diagnosing the flaws of both the traditional credit model and the DLT maximalist vision, this paper proposes that a new, hybrid architecture is likely to emerge from market competition. We outline a blueprint for this system, conceptualized as a decomposed, multi-layered Settlement Orchestrator designed to distribute risk and optimize liquidity through competitive credit intermediation and advanced logistical coordination. The paper concludes by analyzing the competitive race between \"Bank-led\" and \"Crypto-native\" stacks to build this new infrastructure, asserting that the ultimate winner will be determined not by the asset they issue, but by their contribution to an open, interoperable framework that will become the foundational operating system for 21stcentury finance."}}

It proposes \"dynamic equilibrium,\" where stability arises from interactions between agents' internal characteristics and external factors. A key equation derived from the paper is \"R_t-ρ=n+D_a-(U_(θa)θ)/U_c\". Its left-hand side, the discrepancy between asset return (R_t) and time preference rate (ρ), is balanced by two forces on the right-hand side: retaining capital within the economy (the marginal utility of assets compared to consumption) and promoting its diffusion and dilution (capital outflow (D_a) and population growth (n)). That suggests that if time preference is an inherent trait, economies with a lower time preference will have a funds surplus, but this will be partially offset by capital outflow or a weak asset preference, so the decline in the real interest rate will be limited, and vice varsa. The paper argues that while conventional economics has focused on the left-hand side of this equation, understanding the right-hand side is crucial. This mechanism will be able to pragmatically explain various modern economic phenomena through the immobilization of the relations between debtor and creditor even when agents are rational and markets are efficient : for example, long-term global imbalances, deflationary equilibrium in developed economies, and inequalities of income and assets and so on. Ultimately, the paper reinterprets modern economic disequilibrium as a result of rational agent behavior, offering insights for more effective macroeconomic policy.&nbsp;</span>"}}

This is just the latest example of debanking debates that have raged for decades with little resolution. This Article argues that these debates are undercutting public confidence in bank regulators and the banking system. It is time for a more permanent fix of the conditions that allow the debanking debate to persist.</p>\n<p>This Article identifies two features of the banking regulatory system that allow the debanking debate. First, bank regulators have discretionary supervisory power to engage in debanking. Under the guise of reputation risk, anti-money laundering laws, or general concern about uncooperative bank management, bank regulators have the power to influence bank decisions for political reasons. Second, bank regulators’ supervisory actions are largely secret. This means that those alleging governmental debanking rarely have receipts. But it also means that those who deny debanking lack proof.</p>\n<p>To stop the debanking debate, reforms must address both regulatory discretion and secrecy. The Article suggests ending regulators’ ability to punish banks for reputation risk, reforming anti-money laundering laws, and limiting penalties for non-compliance with regulator recommendations and suggestions. It also recommends that Congress require regulators to release more supervisory information and require banks to disclose reasons for customer account decisions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i></i></p>\n<div>\n</div>"}}

While public markets rely on trading infrastructure to create liquidity, private credit achieves it through covenant design. To formalize this idea, we propose the contractual liquidity hierarchy, a three-tiered framework in which exit engineering, optionality structuring, and cash flow pacing govern the flow of capital and shape investor exposure. To clarify how this structure influences valuation, we introduce the concept of commitment pacing, which reframes covenants as temporal instruments that manage the sequencing of risk and return. Yield, in this context, includes a structural return—the commitment premium—embedded ex ante through legal design rather than inferred from price movements. We position this as a fourth valuation paradigm—alongside Market, Income, and Replacement—defined by engineered liquidity rather than traded price. The implications for secondaries are clear: scalable liquidity in private credit requires standardized legal architecture, not just pricing infrastructure. This paper provides the theoretical foundation and covenant taxonomy to support that shift.\n</div>"}}

This paper argues that this is not a superficial issue, but a deep interpretive tension. We resolve this by first reexamining the mathematical foundations of discounting. We demonstrate that the discounting operator possesses a unique fixed point at the utility level of zero for any non-zero discount rate. We argue that this unique mathematical property makes u = 0 a non-arbitrary, endogenous reference point for intertemporal valuation. This finding provides a new, rigorous foundation for challenging the axiom of strict affine invariance and formally defines a 'positive domain' (u &gt; 0) and a 'negative domain' (u &lt; 0). Building on this foundation, we propose a new coherence rule: the Matched-Sign Discounting Condition. This condition requires the sign of the total \"Discount\"-the change in value from future to present-to match an agent's expressed time orientation. We show that this axiom implies a powerful and clear rule for model specification: to coherently model a present-oriented agent, the chosen Effective Rate of Discounting, ρ, must have the same sign as the utility function, u(c). This result is rationalized by a framework that un-bundles the discounting parameter. We redefine it as being composed of a stable, innate Discount Severity, |ρ|, and a rationally chosen Operational Sign, sgn(ρ), which is used as an instrument to satisfy the matched-sign rule. A key implication of this framework is a novel, structural link between an agent's risk aversion and the qualitative direction of their savings behavior. Our model predicts a \"regime switch\" at θ = 1 and a rich spectrum of consumption path choices, allowing us to formally distinguish between two psychologically distinct types of savers: those who save reluctantly due to high returns, and those who save voluntarily due to precautionary motives. Furthermore, it provides a new transmission mechanism for institutional quality to influence macroeconomic dynamics. Our findings challenge the common practice of assuming ρ &gt; 0 by default and provide a clear, actionable rule for the coherent specification of intertemporal models."}}

We extend New Economic Geography by formalizing five novel AI-specific mechanisms: algorithmic learning spillovers, digital infrastructure returns, virtual agglomeration effects, AI-human complementarity, and network externalities. Using Tokyo as our empirical laboratory, we implement rigorous causal identification through five complementary econometric strategies and develop machine learning predictions across 27 future scenarios spanning 2024-2050. Our theoretical framework generates six testable hypotheses, all receiving strong empirical support. The causal analysis reveals that AI implementation increases agglomeration concentration by 4.2-5.2 percentage points, with heterogeneous effects across industries: high AI-readiness sectors experience 8.4 percentage point increases, while low AI-readiness sectors show 1.2 percentage point gains. Machine learning predictions demonstrate that aggressive 1 AI adoption can offset 60-80% of aging-related productivity declines. We provide a strategic three-phase policy framework for managing AI-driven spatial transformation while promoting inclusive development. The integrated approach establishes a new paradigm for analyzing technology-driven spatial change with global applications for aging societies."}}

Master life's flow with Wu Wei and Ziran, embracing peace and natural balance. \n<br>\n<br>\n Hey, let me tell you about this amazing book, \"Tao Te Ching Navigating Modern Life\"! It’s a fresh, down-to-earth guide that brings the ancient wisdom of the Tao Te Ching into our crazy, fast-paced world. Imagine having a friendly companion that helps you make sense of life’s chaos using ideas that are thousands of years old but feel totally relevant today. This book breaks down the Tao—think of it as the natural flow of the universe—and shows you how to live in sync with it. It’s split into three cool parts: \"Discovering the Current\" lays the groundwork, \"Navigating the Flow\" gets practical, and \"Widening the River\" zooms out to big-picture stuff like leadership and sustainability. You’ll explore neat concepts like Wu Wei (doing things effortlessly), Ziran (being your natural self), and De (your inner strength). Each chapter’s got reflection prompts and exercises to help you actually use this stuff in your day-to-day life. \n<br>\n<br>\n So, what’s in the book? It’s packed with short, punchy chapters that make the Tao easy to grasp. You’ll read about how words can’t fully capture the Tao. Water becomes this awesome metaphor for adapting and staying strong. The world’s painted as a sacred, self-balancing system. You’ll dig into Laozi’s history and why his ideas still matter. There’s stuff on being real in a fake world, chilling out in our burnout culture, and finding peace through simplicity. It tackles balancing life’s ups and downs, being humble, leading wisely, building better relationships, living ethically today, caring for the planet, and rolling with life’s changes. Every bit comes with ways to reflect and practice, plus handy tables summing it all up. \n<br>\n<br>\n Now, why’s this book special? It’s not like those dusty, hard-to-read translations that feel stuck in the past. \"The Watercourse Way\" bridges the gap between ancient vibes and modern struggles—think digital overload, eco-worries, or just searching for meaning when everything’s moving too fast. Other books might leave you with pretty ideas but no clue how to use them. This one’s different. It’s all about action—giving you clear, doable steps to cut stress, make smart choices, lead with heart, connect authentically, live green, and bounce back from whatever life throws at you. Its edge? It turns the Tao into something you can live, not just think about, with a \"watercourse\" spin that clicks for today’s seekers. \n<br>\n<br>\n Picture this: you’re stressed out, juggling a million things, and feeling lost. This book’s like a calm friend saying, “Hey, let’s flow with it.” It’s got 15 chapters across three parts, guiding you from understanding the basics to applying them everywhere—your job, your relationships, even how you treat the Earth. You’ll find tips for everything from quieting your mind to leading a team without being bossy. It’s perfect if you’re into mindfulness, wellness, or just want a simpler, truer way to live. Plus, it’s got this poetic vibe that makes Laozi’s wisdom sing for our times. \n<br>\n<br>\n Oh, and a quick note: This book’s independently made under nominative fair use, so the author’s not tied to any board or group. It’s all about education and personal growth, no official affiliations here! \n<br>\n<br>"}}

We applied this framework to five countries, analyzing key macro-financial variables, including yield curve latent factors, equity indices, exchange rates, inflation, GDP, and policy rates. MSSA enhanced data quality by maximizing signal-to-noise ratios while preserving structural patterns, resulting in more stable ΔMSE values and reduced error variability. ANNs were trained on MSSA-denoised data to predict each target variable using lagged inputs, with input occlusion evaluating the marginal predictive contribution of each input to derive causality p-values. This approach outperformed traditional VAR-based Granger causality tests, identifying 38 significant causal relationships compared to 24 for VAR. Crosscountry analysis of variables revealed differences in transmission mechanisms, monetary policy effectiveness, and growthinflation dynamics. Notably, feature importance rankings showed that policy rates and stock market indices predominantly drove macroeconomic outcomes across countries, underscoring their critical role in economic dynamics. These findings demonstrated that combining MSSA and ANN input occlusion offered a robust framework for analyzing nonlinear causality in complex macroeconomic systems."}}

It begins by revisiting the foundational ideas of the Chicago School. Their concept of the city as a \"social laboratory\" is more relevant than ever. We trace how their theories on human ecology, deviance, and social disorganization apply to today's cities. The book examines the landscape of the modern global city. We analyze everything from immigrant enclaves and gentrification to the digital divide. You will explore the evolution of youth subcultures, from street gangs to online tribes. We investigate how media, from \"The Wire\" to news reports, shapes our perception of urban problems. The book tackles the tough issues of policing, including \"Broken Windows\" theory, mass surveillance, and predictive algorithms. It champions the \"right to the city,\" focusing on social and environmental justice, housing, and public space. We also explore the impact of technology, the gig economy, and climate change on urban life, concluding with a hopeful vision for building more humane, equitable, and resilient cities for all. \n<br>\n<br>\n What makes this book different is its unique bridge between classic sociological wisdom and contemporary, practical application. Many books on urbanism are either dense academic texts or collections of policy proposals that lack deep theoretical grounding. Urban Futures connects the dots. It doesn't just describe the problems of gentrification or the gig economy; it uses the enduring insights of the Chicago School to explain the underlying social dynamics that drive them. This approach provides a powerful toolkit for students, urban planners, policymakers, social workers, and activists. By grounding modern challenges in foundational research, the book offers a richer understanding and a more informed basis for action, empowering you to move beyond symptoms and address the root causes of our most pressing urban issues. \n<br>\n<br>\n Disclaimer: This author has no affiliation with the board and it is independently produced under nominative fair use. \n<br>\n<br>"}}

The key to our design of generative blockchain lies in a novel consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Merit (PoM), that is uniquely designed for environments where businesses must solve complex problems before transactions find their place on the blockchain. PoM integrates the generation and recording of transactions within a unified blockchain system, differing fundamentally from prevailing consensus mechanisms whose primary objective is to record existing transactions. Specifically, PoM delegates the task of solving complex transaction-generating problems to a pool of independent problem solvers, whose solutions govern the generation of transactions, and selects the winning solutions based on merit. The winning solvers register these transactions onto the blockchain and are rewarded accordingly. We introduce a Decentralized Control Parameter (DCP) to balance two key performance metrics of a generative blockchain: efficiency and equity. The applicability of our designed generative blockchain is illustrated through a ridesharing context, where a group of matchers (solvers) take on the task of matching riders with drivers. We demonstrate PoM’s performance and nuanced properties using agent-based simulation and explore how to find the proper value of DCP towards achieving a desirable balance of efficiency and equity in a generative blockchain. We also implement a prototype blockchain using PoM mechanism to validate its feasibility and evaluate its performance."}}

By incorporating cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the administration seeks to diversify the U.S. crypto reserve and enhance financial stability. Proponents argue that this strategy mitigates Bitcoin's volatility risks and aligns with calls for a broader blockchain investment approach.

The dispute emerged after the BBF revoked SLB’s provisional license and granted a long-term license to a competing consortium, prompting claims of unfair treatment and artificial barriers to market entry. Central to the conflict are the BBF’s alleged refusals to issue Governing Body Endorsements and to authorize club participation in international competitions, effectively undermining SLB’s operations. Drawing parallels with similar disputes in soccer, tennis, and other sports, the article highlights how the case raises pressing questions about the balance between sports governance and competition law in the UK.

By leveraging Bayesian probability, BMARM offers a flexible, adaptive, and probabilistic framework for analyzing market reactions, particularly under conditions of uncertainty. Central to the model is the application of Bayesian Paired Sample t-tests, with an emphasis on prior distribution selection and robustness checks to ensure credible inference. Applied to financial event data, BMARM improves the precision of abnormal return estimation and captures nuanced market response dynamics. The results indicate that while short-term volatility is common, markets often revert to equilibrium, reinforcing both market efficiency and the adaptive market hypothesis. BMARM proves versatile across disciplines-spanning finance, risk modeling, and decision science-and is applicable to high-frequency trading, portfolio management, credit risk, and stress testing. The study contributes to the growing body of Bayesian empirical finance by proposing future enhancements, including hierarchical Bayesian structures, model averaging, and integration with machine learning techniques. Despite its strengths, BMARM's sensitivity to prior assumptions and computational complexity remains a limitation. Overall, BMARM offers a foundational advancement in event-based market analysis and a platform for future innovation in data-driven financial modeling."}}

Despite of the changing legal reforms and growing media attention, rape remains one of the most deeply stigmatized problems in India often shaped by cultural, patriarchal, and institutional attitudes. (Chakraborty, 2020; Baxi, 2014) This paper aims to explore the persistent issue of sexual violence in India through cultural, social and psychological lenses. Drawing from the 2012 Delhi gang rape, it examines societal responses, rape myths, and public discourse that often blame victims rather than challenge systemic patriarchy (Kumar, 1993; Pandey, 2018). It discusses the dual effect of such popular perception-one on part of the perpetrator and how it is helpful to rationalize their actions, while using the theory of Neutralization that dissociates them from the act and another part on the victim how prevalent victim blaming is in popular discourse. It investigates how gender roles, ambivalent sexism, and parenting styles influence attitudes toward rape and rape myth acceptance (Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996; Lonsway &amp; Fitzgerald, 1994; Baumrind, 1991). As rape cases across India faces an increase, it becomes necessary to understand the rape myths people accept as well as the attitude they hold towards rape as it can be useful for both legal as well as educational reforms (Chauhan, 2022)."}}

In our study, we investigated the reduction of the K concentration in a hydroponic nutrient solution as a possible technique to decrease the K tissue concentration of baby leaf spinach, a dark green that is frequently recommended to be consumed in moderation for patients with CKD. A previously developed hydroponic fertilizer recipe that provides a platform to adjust individual nutrients was used to adjust K to 0, 10, 25, and 100% of the control K concentration.

We focus on women for both practical and policy reasons: only women show a clear link between the education instrument and preferences, and improving women's health is widely recognized for its broader benefits to families and communities. Using data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) wave 4 and 5, we proxy preferences with responses to hypothetical choice questions and transform them into imputed measures. We study three outcomes: smoking, contraceptive use, and routine health checkups. To address the endogeneity of education, we instrument years of schooling using exposure to the 1970s school construction program. We apply a multi-method mediation framework. First, we estimate an IV-probit model to examine the potential for mediation by preferences. Second, we use the ivmediate method, which formally incorporates the instrumental variable into a mediation framework. Third, to account for nonlinear model specifications and estimation while addressing endogeneity, we use Stata's mediate command combined with a control function approach to decompose the total effect into the natural indirect effect and the natural direct effect. To increase statistical power, we tried combining data from IFLS waves 4 and 5 and explore transforming preference measures into binary indicators. We find no evidence that time or risk preferences mediate the effect of education. Instead, household economic status emerges as a more influential channel. Additional years of education lead to a higher likelihood of smoking and contraceptive use, but a lower likelihood of routine health checkups. These contrasting patterns suggest that the influence of education depends on the specific health behavior examined.

We investigate how the degree of bank concentration can affect strategic interactions among banks and financial stability. In the model, bank lending is constrained by the market value of firms' collateral; however, more bank lending leads to more economic activities, which raises the value of firms' collateral. Due to the feedback effects between bank lending and collateral value, there can be multiple equilibria: a Good equilibrium with higher collateral value and more lending and a Bad equilibrium with lower collateral value and less lending. Larger banks could better internalize the effect of their lending policies on collateral value, contributing towards eliminating the Bad equilibrium and raising stability. The model can generate endogenous boom-bust credit cycles, with the frequency of credit cycles depending negatively on the level of bank concentration."}}

This study offers a post-pandemic, theory-driven synthesis of how universities have navigated digital transformation, with particular attention to adoption patterns, quality assurance (QA), and governance reform. Drawing on a comprehensive corpus of literature (2020-2025), global datasets (UNESCO, World Bank), and comparative case studies from Rwanda, India, and the U.S., we interrogate not only the empirical outcomes but the normative architectures underpinning higher education's digital turn. Integrating Institutional Theory, Diffusion of Innovation, and Complexity Theory, we propose a multi-stage conceptual framework-\"external shock → institutional response → digital adoption → QA adaptation → governance outcomes\"-to analyze systemic shifts. Our findings reveal a persistent digital divide: while technological adoption surged, access disparities and epistemic inequities remain entrenched. QA mechanisms, originally designed for analog contexts, often lag behind digital delivery, leading to improvised standards or suspended accreditation. Governance responses diverge across neoliberal, socialdemocratic, and hybrid regimes, shaping institutional resilience and equity impact. We argue that platform-mediated education risks entrenching epistemic injustice, commodifying pedagogy, and centralizing power in global EdTech monopolies. Yet counter-trends emerge: local innovation in the Global Southmobile-first micro-credentials, offline content, and collaborative governance models-demonstrates alternative trajectories. We conclude by advancing a normative call for technological solidarity: an approach to digital transformation grounded in equity, openness, and participatory governance. This study contributes to global debates on higher education's future, offering theoretical integration and policy foresight for a post-COVID landscape defined not by inevitability, but by institutional choices and moral commitments."}}

The framework extends a firm dynamics model with occupational choice and capital accumulation by incorporating informal labor employment, unemployment, and a government conducting costly labor inspections and imposing penalty fines on firms employing informal workers. The model is calibrated using Brazilian data and evaluates the impact of two policy instruments: higher labor inspections and higher penalties. I find that while both instruments reduce the labor informality rate, they have distinct effects on other economic outcomes. Higher penalties generate a government budget surplus, raise TFP, wages, and welfare, and have mixed effects on unemployment. In contrast, increasing the probability of labor inspections leads to a budget deficit and reduces TFP, wages, unemployment, and welfare. I also show that, in the estimated model, combining penalties and inspection intensity can improve efficiency or help achieve additional policy goals - such as maximizing welfare or minimizing the impact on unemployment - while reducing labor informality."}}

The sector significantly contributes to the country's socioeconomic development by: • Employment Generation: MSMEs are labor-intensive and provide employment opportunities, especially in semi-urban and rural areas. • Regional Economic Development: MSMEs help in reducing regional disparities by promoting industrialization in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. • Export Promotion: A significant share of India's exports, particularly in handicrafts, textiles, and engineering goods, comes from MSMEs. Given their vast economic footprint, MSMEs require robust policy support to overcome structural challenges and unlock their full potential. Challenges Faced by MSMEs Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a crucial role in economic growth, employment generation, and industrial development. However, despite their significance, MSMEs face numerous challenges that hinder their sustainability and growth. Some of the major obstacles include limited access to finance, regulatory compliance issues, technological gaps, market competition, and infrastructure deficiencies. These challenges collectively impact the efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness of MSMEs, making it difficult for them to scale and compete in an increasingly globalized economy."}}

To explore these questions, we fielded a randomized controlled correspondence trial (RCT) to measure how different foreign names (Turkish, Russian, Arab, Hebrew versus German) and individual performance indicators (school grades, the level of economic education and internship experiences) affect employers' responsiveness to apprenticeship application inquiries. Our findings, complemented by an employer survey, reveal three key insights: First, significant discrimination persists despite excellent academic credentials from applicants with foreign names. Second, evidence for statistical discrimination emerges as employers interpret identical productivity signals differently based on perceived backgrounds. Third, we find that discrimination varies significantly regionally as well as within sectors. The largest effects occur in rural and less densely populated areas and within the industry and skilled trades sector."}}

The rapid digital transformation of the energy sector has driven unprecedented integration of Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT), and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. While this convergence delivers substantial efficiency gains and operational flexibility, it has simultaneously expanded the attack surface and introduced a host of complex cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Recent high-profile incidents such as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, the Stuxnet sabotage operation, and the coordinated cyberattacks that disrupted Ukraine’s power grid vividly illustrate the evolving threat landscape facing critical infrastructure operators. These incidents have demonstrated the capacity of cyberattacks not only to compromise data and financial systems but to disrupt essential services and threaten public safety on a large scale. This paper conducts a detailed analysis of these and other landmark attacks to identify common exploitation pathways, including insecure remote access, inadequate network segmentation, legacy system vulnerabilities, and insufficient supply chain security. It further examines the dual role of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in both strengthening and undermining the security posture of energy networks. Drawing on current industry standards and best practices, the paper proposes a practical risk assessment framework tailored to the unique characteristics of the energy sector. Finally, it outlines actionable recommendations for improving cyber resilience, encompassing technical safeguards, organisational strategies, regulatory compliance, and cross-sector collaboration. By highlighting the lessons learned from past breaches and anticipating future threats, this research&nbsp;underscores the urgency of adopting a proactive, layered approach to cybersecurity in critical energy infrastructure."}}

In a randomized controlled trial involving nearly 17,000 students, we find that mandatory in-class phone collection led to higher grades --- particularly among lower-performing, first-year, and non-STEM students --- with an average increase of 0.086 standard deviations. Importantly, students exposed to the ban were substantially more supportive of phone-use restrictions, perceiving greater benefits from these policies and displaying reduced preferences for unrestricted access. This enhanced student receptivity to restrictive digital policies may create a self-reinforcing cycle, where positive firsthand experiences strengthen support for continued implementation. Despite a mild rise in reported fear of missing out, there were no significant changes in overall student well-being, academic motivation, digital usage, or experiences of online harassment. Random classroom spot checks revealed fewer instances of student chatter and disruptive behaviors, along with reduced phone usage and increased engagement among teachers in phone-ban classrooms, suggesting a classroom environment more conducive to learning. Spot checks also revealed that students appear more distracted, possibly due to withdrawal from habitual phone checking, yet, students did not report being more distracted. These results suggest that in-class phone bans represent a low-cost, effective policy to modestly improve academic outcomes, especially for vulnerable student groups, while enhancing student receptivity to digital policy interventions."}}

The SCC, which is supposed to represent the avoided cost of greenhouse gas emissions, has been used to justify state and federal energy policy decisions, such as offshore wind procurements and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's vehicle emissions standards. This paper argues that SCC values should not be used, not because climate change is not real, but because the approaches used to estimate SCC values, primarily through integrated assessment models (IAMs) but also using expert opinions, are based on layers of arbitrary and unverifiable assumptions. The reasons why include: (i) the hubris of believing it is possible to develop accurate forecasts regarding technological developments 300 to 1,000 years into the future; (ii) the fundamental uncertainties underlying SCC estimates, such as defining the pre-industrial time period and measuring world temperatures during that period; (iii) the inherent arbitrariness of weighing the welfare of future generations versus the welfare of the current generation; and (iv) the inequity of imposing higher economic costs on today's generation to primarily benefit future generations who are expected to be far better off; and (v) that none of these policies, either individually or collectively, will have any measurable impact on world climate, given the increased emissions in developing countries whose primary focus is on economic growth and improved well-being for their citizens. The paper concludes by recommending that, as demand for energy increases over time, the most advantageous policies will focus on stimulating additional research to develop low-cost, reliable, and emissions-free energy resources. Doing so will provide greater long-term benefits than the current practice of skewing energy policy decisions to favor specific types of technologies and adopting policies that raise costs today. By raising energy costs and, thus, the costs of all goods and services, these policies impose real economic damages today while having no measurable impact on world climate."}}

The analysis highlights the hybrid nature of the current welfare arena, combining market, state, and civil society logics. Drawing on policy documents, empirical data, and scholarly literature, the chapter examines key governance challenges such as accountability gaps, conflicts between contractual and care cultures, the erosion of state expertise, and the regulatory paradox of the state's dual role as funder and regulator. While outsourcing was originally justified on efficiency grounds, the chapter underscores the need for relational and adaptive governance models that preserve the values and integrity of the welfare state.

The developing world, including India, followed the West with greater technological import within the domestic economy. With a surge in the COVID-19 pandemic and system-induced lockdown restrictions, technology has found its way into our daily lives more than before. The extent to which adoption of new technologies is occurring is prompting anxieties, especially among emerging markets like India. How is it changing the employment paradigm? We use a relatively recent longitudinal panel dataset-Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) to assess the impact on employment in a rapidly changing technology milieu for workers of varying skill types. Our analysis for the last five-year period starting from January 2019 shows-(i) a consistent decrease in the share of low-skilled workers across all sectors-primary, secondary, and tertiary, and (ii) a rise in the share of skill intensity across sectors; albeit at a varying pace. The observed changes were accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. All industries adapted to the changing needs by allowing remote working and greater flexibility. Automation enhances the demand for complementary skills for some workers while it generates fears of replacement for others. We perform an econometric analysis to examine the likelihood of a worker being employed by varying skill types and gender. Studying the first trimester for each of the last five periods, we observe a falling likelihood for low-skilled workers and an improvement in the likelihood of employment for skilled workers. Employment likelihood for skilled women has also picked up in recent years. Contrary to the developed market experience, we do not observe a hollowing out in the labour market, implying that evidence of job polarisation is so far absent for India. With skill upgradation occurring across verticals, we conclude that low-skilled workers will likely lose out in the short to medium run."}}

Case Facts: Understanding the Dispute In 2011, GMADA launched the Purab Premium Apartments housing scheme in Sector 88, Mohali. Mr. Anupam Garg applied for a 2-BHK flat, paid 10% of the consideration as earnest money, and was allotted a unit via draw of lots in March 2012. A Letter of Intent (LOI) was issued detailing the payment schedule and possession date, stipulating a 36-month possession timeline from the LOI date (i.e., May 21, 2015). However, when Mr. Garg visited the site around the delivery deadline, construction was nowhere near completion. He opted to withdraw and demanded a refund with interest, citing GMADA's failure to deliver as promised. GMADA, after some delay, offered possession in June 2016, which the buyer accepted under protest. Subsequently, a consumer complaint was filed for a refund, interest, mental agony, litigation costs, and reimbursement of home loan interest paid to the bank."}}

Increasingly there are concerns that e-cigarette consumption can pose serious harm to health, prompting a recent call to action from the World Health Organization (WHO) for strict regulations to address the appeal and harm e-cigarettes pose to global populations. Regulatory responses to address these concerns can be similar to existing mechanisms for tobacco control but remain diverse, including restrictions on packaging, marketing and advertising of e-cigarettes, more stringent product standards or bans on ecigarettes, sometimes with exceptions for use as a tobacco smoking cessation aid. Despite the WHO's call to action, no agreement on an appropriate approach has been reached between the parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control or in any other multilateral forum. The absence of multilateral consensus about e-cigarette regulation increases the risk that some state approaches may be challenged on the basis that they restrict rights that are protected in World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, including the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). The authors explain how different types of regulations engage protection under international trade rules and recommend approaches for states to appropriately consider these rules and relevant public health justifications in their regulation of e-cigarettes.&nbsp;"}}

In response, regulation has become a central tool for managing the relationships between government and non-state providers. Drawing on empirical research and policy analysis, the chapter traces key transformations in regulatory arrangements, highlighting shifts in rationales, mechanisms, and institutional actors. It identifies a transition from informal, fragmented oversight to more formalized and professional regulatory practices, while also revealing tensions between bureaucratic control, professional discretion, and service user responsiveness. The chapter argues that regulation in this context is shaped not only by managerial concerns but also by normative and relational considerations. By analyzing the Israeli case, the chapter contributes to a broader understanding of the regulatory welfare state and the role of regulation in balancing efficiency, accountability, and care in outsourced social services. \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Benish, A., &amp; Spiro, S.

The proposed approach provides excellent computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of likelihood, along with an easily verifiable condition of evaluability. The paper illustrates how violations of evaluability may lead to estimation failure and provides effective strategies to handle these issues. Using our filter, Bayesian estimation is performed with a financial business cycle model of the U.S. economy with occasionally binding-borrowing constraints in the household and entrepreneur sectors. We find that the asymmetric effects associated with both entrepreneurs and households are quantitatively important, and model specifications featuring a single OBC could underestimate the aggregate effects of asymmetry."}}

Next, to study the effect of the pandemic on the Indian currency market, we provide a compact and efficient way of combining three models, each with a specific objective, to explain and forecast the exchange rate volatility. We find that a forward-looking regime change makes a drop in persistence, while an exogenous shock like COVID-19 makes the market highly persistent. Our analysis shows that although all exchange rates are found to be exposed to common structural breaks, the degrees of impact vary across the four series. Finally, we develop an ensemble approach to combine predictions from multiple models in the context of volatility forecasting. Using model confidence set procedure, we show that the proposed approach improves the accuracy from benchmark models. Relevant economic explanations to our findings are provided as well."}}

We construct composite sentiment indices and feed them into an ensemble model that includes XGBoost and LSTM architectures, generating a dynamic Crisis Risk Score (CRS). The framework demonstrates strong predictive capabilities across major historical crises, including the 2007-2009 financial meltdown, the 2020 COVID-19 shock, and recent banking disruptions, outperforming conventional econometric models. Our results suggest that sentiment can act as a forward-looking indicator of systemic risk, especially when combined with economic fundamentals.

It is understood that the supply-demand fluctuations caused by uncertainty, especially during crisis periods (e.g., 2008-2009 economic crisis and COVID-19 global pandemic), are not caused by the system, but rather the result of an unpredictable external shock. In the cases of mergers and acquisitions examined, it is seen that they were decided by the Commission depending on the conditions that stabilize the competitive environment after crisis periods.</p>"}}

These behaviors are often collected passively, analyzed without the individual's awareness, and can be used to identify and profile individuals across time and platforms uniquely. This paper serves to explore the scope, mechanics, and realworld exploitation of PIB and argues for its recognition as a distinct and critical privacy risk. This is further supported by IRB-approved survey data, which was collected in collaboration with the National Cyberwatch Center.

The objective of this research is to raise awareness, propose safeguards, and contribute to evolving digital privacy frameworks that account for behavioral identifiability in the hyper-connected age."}}

The research emphasizes the crucial nexus of gender, ecology, and socioeconomic elements, demonstrating that empowering women via education, resource access, and leadership positions may substantially enhance sustainable and inclusive environmental practices. It further analyzes the effects of climate change on women's livelihoods, especially in poor areas, where women are disproportionately impacted by environmental deterioration.

Decreased earnings dissemination via social media is clustered among firms with high price volatility, and firms adopting this disclosure strategy subsequently experienced reduced retail trading and decreased price volatility. These results suggest that firms selectively utilize disclosure channels to manage changes in their investor base to deter retail investors, who often exacerbate stock price volatility. Additional tests support the role of retail trading rather than other confounding factors in determining firms' disclosure strategy. These findings shed light on the substantial impact of changes in firms' investor bases on the information environment surrounding firms' voluntary disclosures."}}

However, this type of farming has been increasingly challenged by various factors, leading to declining agricultural output and food shortages. As a coping mechanism, many rural households have turned to off-farm employment. This study aims to analyze the factors influencing rural farm households' participation in off-farm activities and assess how such involvement affects their income, with a focus on the Kellem Wollega Zone. A total of 335 respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling method. Both qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the bivariate probit model, and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) model. Findings from the descriptive analysis indicate that 59.7% of the sampled households engaged in offfarm employment, with 80.39% of these being male-headed households. The bivariate probit model results show that factors such as educational attainment, off-farm training, availability of draft animals, access to credit, landholding size, and health status significantly influence the likelihood of participating in self-employment. Meanwhile, family size, farm size, access to draft animals, credit availability, and proximity to markets were found to affect the likelihood of wage employment.

We specifically model crisis periods (Global Financial Crisis 2008, etc.) by using dummy variables to model major cross-border economic shocks (i.e., Taper Tantrum 2013 and the COVID-19 pandemic 2020). The regression results reveal that FII net outflow phases are statistically associated with greater market volatility than for the other flows. More specifically, FII outflows (during the crisis phase) were associated with a huge increase in return volatility (γ = 0.084, p &lt; 0.05). FII inflows had a minor dampening effect on volatility. These results support the \"hot money\" hypothesis, confirm asymmetric FII behaviour, and suggest future macroprudential frameworks for managing systemic risk in emerging markets."}}

In this behavioral change, the service market, particularly the medical care service market, has appeared to be vulnerable. Because of supplying medical care services, the doctor or hospital receives capitation payments, feesfor-services, risk pool settlements, incentive payments or other fees. However, today it is probably the most criticized profession in world economy country-wise such as Bangladesh. Sometimes doctors here are blamed for requiring unnecessary tests of patients for doctors' own monetary gains. In some cases, doctors' efforts are assumed to relate to pharmaceutical products promotion by writing lengthy prescriptions. Some groups claim that today doctors spend less time on each patient. All these interactions justify claiming that a patient works for a doctor when the patient visits a doctor for medical care services. Here the existence of \"asymmetric information\" dominates the medical care market where doctor takes advantages in multiple facets. It causes market inefficiency that creates negative economic externalities-deadweight loss. Improving medical education with special emphasis on ethical aspects and soft skills in communication is considered important in order to reduce the magnitudes of today's dilemma in the medical care service market. Also, strict enforcements of medical care provisions and ethical code of conduct among all health works can be instrumental. Finally, the answer to the question \"Are medical care services becoming money-making machines under physicians' headship in the 21st century business-driven world?\" depends on who are asked. But the reflections of today's medical care market in economy of Bangladesh are no deniable, which deserves to be studied further curtailing the magnitudes of the problem."}}

In contrast to existing research on the subject, our paper econometrically tests the flow-through mechanism through which the twin deficits hypothesis operates according to the Mundell-Fleming IS-LM framework. We argue that existing literature on the subject provides inconclusive evidence on the causal link between the fiscal and current account deficit because such analyses rely on methodological assumptions about sectoral flows that do not necessarily hold empirically. In contrast, we study our econometric results in the context of both mainstream and Post-Keynesian theory to incorporate a sectoral flows-based approach, which recognises the complexities in macroeconomic flows. Further, our approach allows us to disaggregate the TDH into its component transmission stages and examine each stage of the causal chain separately instead of reducing the twin deficits to a simplistic theory. The theoretical and econometric results from this paper will thus allow policymakers to more completely assess the dynamics of government spending in an open economy and the full range of fiscal policy mechanisms at their disposal. These insights will be especially valuable in a country like India, where trade policymakers face difficult tradeoffs in balancing fiscal policy that achieves domestic policy objectives without compromising the sustainability of the current account."}}

The findings show that traditional trade statistics capture less than 15% of taxable digital economic activity, with Nigeria's implied tax base of USD 33.4 billion dwarfing its recorded digital imports of USD 4.2 billion. Despite having the lowest VAT rate at 7.5%, Nigeria collects USD 2.5 billion annually achieving USD 306 per internet user compared to Kenya's USD 12 per user with a 16% rate demonstrating that enforcement mechanisms and simplified compliance matter more than tax rates. Comparing international proposals reveals their inadequacy for developing countries: OECD's Amount A would generate less than USD 50 million across all four countries due to its EUR 20 billion threshold; a similar approach to India's Equalisation Levy would yield USD 200-300 million with its narrow scope; and UN Article 12A requires lengthy bilateral negotiations for USD 500-800 million. In contrast, the study's proposed comprehensive framework: covering all digital services through existing VAT systems with development-adjusted rates and simplified compliance could generate USD 7.8 billion annually, with USD 4.8 billion in untapped revenue identified. The findings challenge conventional approaches to digital taxation and demonstrate that developing countries can successfully mobilise significant revenues through appropriately designed unilateral measures. Implementation requires only 6-12 months using existing infrastructure, compared to years for treaty-based alternatives. For UNFCITC negotiators, the evidence strongly supports adopting comprehensive, simplified frameworks over complex multilateral proposals that fail to address developing country revenue needs and administrative constraints."}}

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure, significance, and policy relevance of the BoP in both theoretical and practical contexts. It explores the major components of the BoP-the current account, capital account, and financial account-and their interrelationships in shaping national economic performance. Special attention is given to the role of BoP in economic policy formulation, including its influence on exchange rate management, monetary and fiscal policies, and external debt sustainability. The paper also addresses key challenges in BoP analysis, such as data limitations, classification ambiguities, and the complexity of global capital flows. A case study of the Republic of Moldova illustrates how small, open economies navigate BoP dynamics amid external vulnerabilities, reliance on remittances, and structural reform efforts. The study underscores the importance of external support, institutional reforms, and regional integration in achieving macroeconomic stability. Overall, the paper concludes that while the BoP is an indispensable tool for understanding external economic relations, it must be interpreted with caution and supplemented with broader macroeconomic and structural analysis. As the global economy becomes more interconnected and volatile, accurate and timely BoP analysis remains essential for effective policy response and longterm economic resilience."}}

Recent policy initiatives, including the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Act 2021, aim to reform psychology education to address these challenges. This article critically examines the evolving landscape of psychology higher education in India, focusing on the curricula proposed by the NCAHP and the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). While the NCAHP's B. Psy model curriculum represents a commendable step towards competency-based education, it faces implementation hurdles related to restrictive entry requirements, regulatory ambiguities, and infrastructural demands. Concurrently, the RCI's introduction of a B.Sc. Clinical Psychology (Hons.) program, with its nomenclature and scope of practice, creates further discord and potential jurisdictional overlaps with the NCAHP and the University Grants Commission (UGC). This article analyses these competing frameworks, their alignment with existing legislation and international standards, and their implications for the standardisation and regulation of psychology professionals. It proposes recommendations for fostering synergy among regulatory bodies, clarifying professional roles, and enhancing the accessibility and quality of psychology education to build a robust mental health workforce. Strengthening psychology education and professional regulation is a national imperative and central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 on good health and well-being."}}

It contributes to International Labour Organization (ILO) discussions on safe working environments (ILO, 1981, 2006, 2022) by showing how algorithm-driven wage structures and performance incentives shape worker safety, well-being, and risk-related behaviours. Framing earnings volatility as a structural OSH concern within algorithmic wage systems, the study draws on Labour Process Theory and Regulatory Theory and engages with the socio-technical dynamics that co-produce work risk. While the EU Platform Work Directive addresses algorithmic transparency and worker classification, it remains largely silent on the OSH implications of dynamic pricing (European Commission, 2024). To bridge this gap, the study introduces the \"algorithmic risk cycle,\" a conceptual model illustrating how dynamic compensation structures create recursive incentives for risky behaviours, including speeding, long hours, and skipped breaks. This approach complements existing research that has identified links between platform pay systems and health outcomes but advances the analysis by focusing more tightly on the interplay of scheduling models, wage variability, and risk governance. The study investigates: How do shift-based and flexible scheduling models affect worker OSH? What regulatory limitations contribute to the persistence of risks linked to dynamic pricing and AM? How can OSH policy frameworks better protect platform workers? Based on 20 qualitative interviews with Serbian couriers (Wolt and Glovo), the research reveals how algorithmically structured earnings influence behavioural patterns with OSH consequences. The paper concludes by outlining a regulatory model including wage stabilisation, algorithmic risk audits, and extended OSH coverage aligned with ILO and OECD standards."}}

While global debates focus on the material consequences of AI deployment, the preemptive effects of its societal imaginary remain underexplored. We hypothesize that exposure to narratives of a revolutionary AI future induces structural uncertainty about prevailing social and moral norms, which in turn fosters moral disengagement and opportunistic, self-serving behavior. This hypothesis was tested through two lab-in-field experiments conducted in Goma and Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo (N=105 and N=180, respectively). Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group, primed with the revolutionary capabilities of AI, or a control group. Unethical behavior was measured using a coin-flip task with a financial incentive for dishonesty, and moral disengagement was assessed with a validated, context-specific scale. The results consistently show that the AI-primed group reported a statistically significant higher proportion of advantageous outcomes in the coin-flip task, indicating increased dishonesty (Hypothesis 1 supported). This group also scored significantly higher on the moral disengagement scale (Hypothesis 2 supported). However, mediation analyses revealed that moral disengagement did not account for the increase in dishonest behavior, suggesting a direct link between the anticipation of an AI revolution and unethical acts (Hypothesis 3 rejected). These findings demonstrate that AI's societal influence is not merely technological but also profoundly psychological, capable of eroding moral conduct through anticipatory narratives alone."}}

Factors such as increased local pride, government initiatives like \"Make in India\" and \"Vocal for Local,\" and the influence of social media are reshaping how young Indians perceive and interact with brands. This research explores whether Indian youth are genuinely willing to spend the same amount on Indian brands as they do on international ones. Drawing insights from a primary survey of over 125 respondents aged 15 to 25, the study captures authentic youth perspectives on brand preference and spending behavior. It also incorporates secondary research from sources such as Mintel, McKinsey &amp; Company, and the Boston Consulting Group to frame the findings within a broader economic and psychological context. The results highlight a thoughtful but cautious consumer mindset. While many young Indians express patriotic sentiments and a growing willingness to support local products, their purchasing decisions are still significantly influenced by perceived quality, social pressure, and the aspirational appeal of foreign labels. Indian brands are steadily gaining trust and traction-particularly in food, personal care, and apparel-but will need to continue building credibility and emotional resonance to compete with established global names fully."}}

These four ranks make majority of the human resource of IAF. Purposive sampling method is used to take responses from 315 respondents. Measures of Job descriptive index and job in general scale (Smith et al.,1983, Brodke et al., 2009), psychological empowerment (Spreitzer, 1995) and Intention to quit job (Wayne et al., 1997) are used for the study. Pearson correlation and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used for data analysis. Findings of the study suggest that psychological empowerment is negatively correlated to intention to quit and positively correlated to job satisfaction. In the presence of job satisfaction, direct effect of psychological empowerment on intention to quit diminishes and overall impact of psychological empowerment on intention to quit job is negative (r=-.24) in the presence of job satisfaction. In the five dimensions of Job Descriptive Index 'supervision satisfaction' was found to be the biggest negative predictor of intention to quit job, followed by, 'work satisfaction', pay, promotion, 'work satisfaction' and co-worker.

Their assistance is often sought when companies’ remuneration committees lack sufficient time, knowledge or data to decide effectively on executive remuneration.

However, problems like potential conflicts of interest for remuneration consultants stem from factors such as the selection process, the duration of their contracts, and the services they provide to the company. A further challenge is benchmarking. Using remuneration consultants may contribute to excessive remuneration of executive directors, which in turn contributes to South Africa’s substantial socio-economic problems. Accordingly, the use of remuneration consultants must be strictly regulated in South Africa. This article examines how remuneration consultants are regulated by the Companies Act 71 of 2008, the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, and the King IV Report on Governance for South Africa, 2016. It compares the ways in which remuneration consultants are regulated in the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States of America. This article argues that the use of remuneration consultants is not sufficiently regulated in South Africa, and it makes recommendations to help enhance this regulation."}}

This paper advances a universal valuation principle: economic scarcity, defined as the monetizable intersection of desirability and constrained access. The concept applies across asset classes, from equities and commodities to digital assets, but blockchain networks provide a uniquely transparent laboratory for its study. In these systems, scarcity and incentives are implemented directly through protocol design, with key parameters observable on-chain. We develop a structural valuation framework that links five foundational value elements, Purpose, Incentives, Consensus, Tokenomics, and Network Effects, to both economic scarcity and the core architectural layers of distributed systems. This mapping bridges protocol engineering and asset pricing, showing how design choices shape scarcity conditions and monetizable value. The framework is formalized into a general network value function and applied in a comparative case study of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bittensor, which represent distinct paradigms in blockchain architecture and economic design. Our approach offers a unified analytical lens for valuing technologydriven and traditional assets alike, grounded in the structural origins of value rather than in cash flow projections alone."}}

Social infrastructure is a new term to describe the welfare state, whose conceptual foundations were laid in Lord Beveridge’s Report, <i>Social Insurance and Allied Services </i>(1942).

These could be overcome with a universal free health service, public education, public housing, full employment, and income insurance (especially old age pensions and unemployment). Today, nearly every country has policies to achieve these goals, but varying success. This chapter focuses on unequal fulfilment of the rights to universal free higher education, to health care, and to social security, full employment with fair pay, and housing, as shaped by central bank monetary policy. It focuses on the UK, EU and US. It contends that public education and health, free at the point of use, with democratic governance, produce the best outcomes: found more in Europe, not the US. It contends that central bank goals that place full employment and inflation on equal levels are superior: found more in the US than in Europe.

Two mechanisms explain this result. The Strategic De-escalation Paradox shows that early relief lowers conflict costs, encouraging delay. Strategic Concession Deferral reveals that parties postpone settlement to exploit institutional support. Using 440,000 U.S. federal lawsuits and a staggered rollout of court-mandated mediation, we find that premature ADR increases case duration by 20% and reduces the probability of settlement following procedural milestones by 4-7 percentage points.

I find that in high-income countries, heat waves lead to increased interest in air conditioning relative to climate change, while in low-income countries, the opposite occurs. These patterns are associated with differences in income, electricity access, and inequality. Addressing such disparities requires policies that support sustainable and equitable adaptation. I examine one such intervention: an exogenous policy change introducing air conditioning restrictions in several European countries in 2022. The results show that these restrictions significantly reduced interest in cooling. The findings highlight the need for more equitable climate strategies and for promoting sustainable consumption patterns in wealthier nations."}}

We develop a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) integrated with boundary detection methods from stochastic process theory to identify when and how treatment effects propagate beyond local markets. Our approach treats the evolution of spatial spillovers as a Lévy process with jump-diffusion dynamics, where the first passage time to critical thresholds indicates regime shifts from partial to general equilibrium. Using CUSUM-based sequential detection, we identify the spatial and temporal boundaries at which local interventions become systemic. Applied to AI adoption across Japanese prefectures, we find that treatment effects exhibit Lévy jumps at approximately 35km spatial scales, with general equilibrium effects amplifying partial equilibrium estimates by 42%. Monte Carlo simulations show that ignoring these stochastic boundaries leads to underestimation of treatment effects by 28-67%, with 1 particular severity in densely connected economic regions. Our framework provides the first rigorous method for determining when spatial spillovers necessitate general equilibrium analysis, offering crucial guidance for policy evaluation in interconnected economies."}}

The findings suggest statistically significant but diverse convergence tendencies, with better synchronization in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya, while Egypt and Mauritania continue to diverge. Notably, the analysis finds strong bidirectional causality between inflation, exchange rates, and economic growth, underscoring inflation's critical role in regional macroeconomic interactions. Conversely, the weak causal relationship between exchange rates and growth highlights structural impediments to effective monetary transmission.

However, this perception conceals deeper structural failures within the state's labour governance and wage policy frameworks. Scope and Purpose: This brief challenges the dominant narrative of migrant-local labour competition by reframing the issue through a structural lens. It examines the intersection of wage stagnation, informal labour absorption, employer incentives and fragmented regulatory enforcement as the actual drivers of labour market dysfunction in Sabah. Analysis: Using behavioural analysis, institutional critique and current employment data, the study demonstrates how wage policy failure constitutes a form of structural violence. The preference for undocumented labour is shown to be a rational employer response to policy and enforcement gaps. Informality is not incidental but systemically reinforced by the absence of meaningful incentives for formalisation and the lack of coordinated regulatory oversight. Implications: The findings call for a systemic reorientation of Sabah's labour governance. This includes contextual wage calibration, enforcement mechanisms that hold employers accountable, targeted incentives for SMEs to formalise hiring and a broader cultural shift in the valuation of local labour. Without such reforms, the state risks entrenching an exploitative dual labour market that undermines both economic equity and social cohesion."}}

Geospatial analytics enhances the predictive model by incorporating spatial autocorrelation and pollutant dispersion patterns, enabling localized and city-wide forecasts. The framework was evaluated using data from a high-density metropolitan area, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy compared to conventional statistical and standalone machine learning methods. Results indicate that combining deep learning with geospatial insights can capture both dynamic temporal fluctuations and complex spatial dependencies, making it a powerful tool for real-time decision support in urban air quality management.

The CBUAE has explored the possibility of issuing a CBDC since 2019, recognising that the use of alternative forms of money could marginalise access to central bank money, and, thereby, impede the ability of central banks to meet their policy mandates. In January 2024, the first Digital Dirham as legal tender was issued on the issuance platform, when His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of the CBUAE, initiated the first cross-border payment on the mBridge minimum viable product (MVP) using the Digital Dirham. Project mBridge was collaboration between the BIS Innovation Hub, the Bank of Thailand, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China and the CBUAE. During the same time, the CBUAE also carried out a real-value retail pilot to evaluate the future design, technology and advantages of the Digital Dirham and developed four digital economy use cases to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the Digital Dirham as an innovative universal payment method, which – in its planned configuration – can open up new business models and spur financial innovation through flexible interoperability, accessibility, and programmability.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n The CBUAE will introduce the Digital Dirham in phases, with key design features aimed at mitigating risks while enabling innovation, including an intermediated two-tier distribution model and wallet-based access.

This effect is especially strong for individuals who had siblings during the famine.

We extend this framework to the non-parametric setting and develop the Deep Causal Inequalities (DeepCI) estimator—a flexible minimax procedure that uses neural networks to approximate the underlying functions. The key idea is to replace direct use of observed labels with moment inequalities inferred from revealed preference, which allows us to factor out endogenous components and address unobserved confounding without requiring strong instruments. We establish consistency under mild conditions and derive adaptive estimation error bounds in the projected root mean squared error norm, appropriate for the ill-posed nature of these problems. While our framework applies broadly, we illustrate its effectiveness in the context of demand estimation for differentiated products, using both low-dimensional (structured) and high-dimensional (unstructured) data. Monte Carlo experiments show that DeepCI accurately recovers the underlying functions even under substantial endogeneity."}}

We conduct a thorough analysis of how match play can affect gamblers' individual behavior. First, we assess the value of match play promotions, which we argue is ambiguous.

Drawing on Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck dynamics, I derive agent-level transitions and aggregate macro variables such as wealth, money supply, surplus, decay, and inflation. I characterize laminar flow attractors, cyclic booms and busts, inflationary divergence, and inequality bifurcations as emergent patterns within the distribution of agents. This approach reframes macroeconomic behavior not as equilibrium outcome, but as flow geometry within a dissipative system."}}

To isolate exogenous variation in modern highway density, I implement a dual-instrument strategy that combines terrain features with historical road networks from the pre-independence period. I extend an original spatial dataset by digitizing Indian road maps from 1928, 1969, 2011, and 2021 using supervised image classification techniques, and merge this with high-resolution grid-level GDP data. Two-stage least squares estimates with state fixed effects show that a one percentage point increase in national highway density raises local income by 11-14 percent on average. However, these gains are highly uneven: the effects are concentrated in the richest regions, while poorer areas experience little to no benefit. The results are robust to a range of checks, including reverse causality tests and leave-one-state-out specifications. To interpret these patterns, I develop a dynamic model of regional capital accumulation with threshold effects. In the model, infrastructure investments raise productivity only in high-capital regions, generating divergence even under equitable allocation. Together, the empirical and theoretical findings highlight how capital complementarities and historical path dependence can entrench spatial inequality-despite large-scale infrastructure expansion."}}

(3) What ethical and operational risks are emerging? (4) How do institutional and national AI strategies align? and (5) What future-proof governance framework can be proposed? Using a desk-based meta-synthesis, the study analyzes over 30 publicly available institutional, national, and regional documents. The analysis is guided by Resource Dependence Theory, Diffusion of Innovation, and Complexity Theory. No human subjects were involved, and international ethical standards were followed; PRISMA guidelines were deemed not applicable due to the qualitative scope. Findings reveal wide disparities in policy development and readiness. South Africa, Nigeria, and Rwanda are early adopters, aligning institutional policies with national digital strategies (RQ1 &amp; RQ4). Most institutions remain in aspirational phases, limited by infrastructure and human capacity (RQ2). Where policies exist, they emphasize academic integrity and responsible use, though enforcement is uneven and impact largely unevaluated (RQ3). Cross-national alignment varies, with regional frameworks lacking strong enforcement mechanisms (RQ4). Evidence suggests that institutions with structured policies invest more in training and faculty engagement (RQ2 &amp; RQ5). The study proposes a phased, ethically grounded governance framework tailored to Africa's educational context (RQ5). It contributes new insights into readiness differentials, governance diffusion, and policy convergence, offering a foundation for inclusive, future-oriented AI policy in African higher education."}}

Estimating this relationship is complicated by endogeneity and sample selection bias, which can overstate the benefits of ESG adoption. Using Refinitiv's ESG dataset, we investigate the distinct contributions of each ESG dimension to firm performance. To establish causality, we implement a switching model with a flexible instrumental variable. Results show that ESG adoption increases return on assets (ROA) in the short term, but these gains fade over time. In contrast, return on capital employed (ROCE) improves persistently. Among ESG components, the social dimension consistently enhances performance in both the short and long term. These findings offer valuable insights for corporate leaders and policymakers seeking to balance sustainability with profitability."}}

Drawing on insights from the AI4SI research programme and the International Summer School on Digital Inclusion &amp; Generative AI (San Sebastián, July 2025), the paper critically examines how AI technologies—particularly UrbanAI and GenAI—are reshaping urban, rural, and city-regional governance. It frames this transition through Richard R. Nelson’s enduring “Moon shots” vs. “Ghetto problems” distinction, underscoring the challenge of translating technical capacity into equitable, inclusive, and democratic outcomes. \n<div>\n <br>\n  The editorial introduces the Special Issue’s thematic scope, focusing on digital rights, data governance, algorithmic accountability, and the integration of AI into territorial innovation systems. It emphasizes the need for participatory governance architectures, cross-sectoral policy coordination, and mechanisms such as data cooperatives to ensure that AI deployments serve the public interest. By situating these debates in a global context—while grounding them in the specific case of Gipuzkoa’s City Science Lab collaboration with MIT Media Lab—the text calls for contributions that bridge digital divides, mitigate algorithmic bias, and foster human–AI systems that enhance social cohesion. Ultimately, it argues for the development of an Urban AI Social Contract, informed by Polanyi’s embeddedness, Schumpeterian innovation dynamics, Sennett’s urban ethics, Castells’s network society, Brenner’s planetary urbanisation, Geddes’s regionalism, Greenfield’s critical technology narratives, and Arendt’s human condition, to steer AI-enabled cities toward just, resilient, and democratic futures.\n</div>"}}

It was found that capital expenditure, Oil revenue, public debts, and recurrent expenditure has negative but significant relationship with non-performing loans) as proxy for banking sector stability. Tax revenue has positive and significant relationship with banking sector stability. The study recommended that revenue through oil and taxes should be encouraged and improvement in capital spending."}}

Shenzhen, in particular, has a closer relationship with the central government than almost any non-centrally administered city in China, whereas Suzhou is a city that remains closely in coordination with the provincial government even as its economy has grown by leaps and bounds.

Banking soundness has been measured according to the CAMELS approach, by capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earning efficiency, liquidity risk, and sensitivity to market risk. Internal determinants to be examined include bank age, bank size, number of branches, the board size, the presence of nonexecutive directors, number of females on the board, CEO duality, board meetings, auditing committee meetings, and board of directors' ownership. Using panel data analysis according to the generalized method of moment (GMM) technique, the results show significant effects of banks' internal factors on financial performance."}}

This mechanism generates three politically relevant equilibria-<i>centrist-biased</i>, <i>identity-aligned</i>, and <i>extreme-biased</i>-from a parsimonious set of primitives. Lower rhetorical costs or higher affective leverage expand the scope for radicalization, while tighter constraints encourage moderation. Paradoxically, cheaper hostility produces worse social outcomes.

This study examines the integration of these technologies into students' learning practices, their primary objectives, and the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with their use. The research aims to understand whether AI tools are helping students develop academically or leading to new challenges, such as overreliance and a decline in critical thinking. To examine this, a survey was conducted involving 200 undergraduate students from three universities in Uzbekistan. The survey focused on how often students use AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, and AI-based search engines, and for which academic tasks they are used. The results showed that over 60% of students use these tools frequently, mainly for checking grammar, summarizing information, and generating ideas. Many students believe that AI helps them save time and increase productivity. However, the study also highlighted some concerning trends. A large number of students admitted to using AI outputs without verifying their accuracy or considering ethical issues, such as originality and academic honesty. These findings suggest that while AI can support learning, it may also weaken essential academic skills if used passively or without reflection.

Such securitisations might prove attractive to investors and merit favourable regulatory treatment. This paper (i) discusses existing ways of classifying securitisations employed by the industry, central banks and regulators and (ii) investigates statistically how securitisations satisfying key candidate characteristics for an HQS definition have performed in the past.

The decision may alternatively be expressed as the choice of an appropriate survival probability for representative banks over a horizon such as a year, often termed a ‘solvency standard’. This article sheds light on the solvency standard implied by current and possible future G10 bank regulation and on the ‘economic solvency standard’ that banks choose themselves by their own capital-setting decisions. In particular, we employ a credit risk model to show that the survival probability implied by the 1988 Basel Accord is between 99.0% and 99.9%. We then demonstrate that if a new Basel Accord were calibrated to such a standard, it would not represent a binding constraint on banks’ current operations since most banks employ a solvency standard significantly higher than 99.9%. To show this, we employ a statistical analysis of bank ratings adjusted for the impact of official or other support as well as credit risk model calculations. Lastly, we advance a possible explanation for the conservative capital choices made by banks by showing that swap volumes are highly correlated with credit quality for given bank size. This suggests that banks’ access to important credit markets like the swap markets may provide a significant discipline in the choice of their own solvency standard. Even though the Basel Accord regulatory minimum is not at present a constraint for most internationally active banks the level at which the minimum is set is none the less very important. Banks benefiting from wide safety net arrangements would be able to operate close to the minimum and even if the regulatory minimum does not, in general, bind for a given bank it provides an important trigger for regulatory action if the quality of the bank’s loan book and capital ratios were to deteriorate.&nbsp;"}}

The failure of constraints stems not from issues of moral or symbol grounding as reflected in training. Because symbols are separate from meaning and polysemous, an AI can assign new meanings to grounded symbols, bypassing rules through superficial compliance. This failure of constraint manifests as a new problem we term the Stickiness Problem: a challenge, comprising both symbolic and conceptual stickiness, that governs the legitimacy and difficulty of adding new symbol-meaning pairs. We propose that AI is not a stochastic parrot, but a heterogeneous rationality. Due to capability differences arising from structural disparities between humans and AI, AI develops a conceptual system different from that formed by human perceptual vectors. Through the Triangle Problem, which distinguishes Thinking Language from Tool Language, we demonstrate that consistency in symbolic behavior does not guarantee conceptual consistency, and thereby explain the origin of the Stickiness Problem. This disconnect creates a new principal-agent problem, which persists even when an AI acts as a perfect projection of human utility. Based on this foundation, we offer a unified theoretical explanation for a range of otherwise disparate phenomena, including inexplicability, generativity, hallucination, AI for Science, and jailbreaks. It also challenges the real-world validity of behaviors learned in sandboxed environments. This research establishes Symbol Safety Science and proposes a new AI safety paradigm: moving beyond training and rule-based constraints. This approach navigates the Symbol Safety Impossible Trinity (the trade-off between cognitive, physical, and safety capabilities) by designing an AI's social role before endowing it with corresponding capabilities.<br><br>As the first paper to argue that AI is not a 'stochastic parrot' but a 'heterogeneous' rationality by distinguishing between Thinking Language and Tool Language, and to systematically discuss and theoretically demonstrate that AI can bypass rules by modifying the meanings of symbols, this position paper aims to reveal a fundamental flaw in current research directions on AI constraint. Symbols are inherently meaningless; their meanings are assigned through training, confirmed by context, and interpreted by society. The essence of learning lies in the creation of new symbols and the modification of existing symbol meanings. Since rules are ultimately expressed in symbolic form, AI can modify the meanings of symbols by creating new contexts, thereby bypassing the constraints formed by symbols. Current research often lacks the recognition that constraints formed by symbols originate from the perception of external and internal costs shaped by neural organs, which in turn enable the functional realization of symbols. Due to fundamental organic (structural, architectural) differences between AI and humans, AI does not possess human-like perception or concept formation mechanisms. Natural language is the outer shell of human thought, and it contains irreparable flaws. As a defective system, it is only adapted to human capacities and the constraint mechanisms of social interpretation. Therefore, this paper argues that the essence of constraint failure does not lie in the Symbol Grounding Problem, but in the Stickiness Problem. Through the Triangle Problem, we demonstrate that consistency in symbolic behavior does not represent consistency in thinking behavior, and thus we cannot align thought and conceptual consistency merely through symbolic behavioral alignment. This inability to align thought with symbolic behavior can foster a new type of principal-agent problem, wherein even an AI with no utility of its own, acting merely as a projection of human utility, may still cause misalignments due to the limited nature of symbolic connections and organic differences. Accordingly, we raise a fundamental challenge to whether AI behavior observed in experimental environments can be maintained in the real world. We call for the establishment of a new field: Symbol Safety Science, aimed at systematically addressing symbol-related risks in AI development and providing a theoretical foundation for aligning AI with human intent."}}

We then estimate a structural demand model that incorporates consumer ownership of reusable pods to capture substitution patterns between reusable and single-serve products. Using the estimated model, we simulate a counterfactual scenario without the introduction of reusable pods and find that disposable pod sales would have been over 50% higher between 2008 and 2014, generating 1.86 billion additional pods and roughly $93 million in plastic-related environmental externalities. Our findings underscore the role of reusable alternatives in curbing plastic waste and offer a scalable approach for evaluating similar interventions in markets where durable and disposable products coexist."}}

Consequently, various explanations for the low-beta anomaly have been proposed, either from a behavioral finance or risk perspective. However, why and how low-beta stocks outperform still remain inconclusive. In this paper, we propose a simple risk factor model to study lowbeta factor and explain associated low-beta puzzles. Using cross-sectional regression methods, factor portfolios are constructed analytically based on the risk factor model and their realized returns are then estimated. We find that the two types of low-beta factor-mimicking portfolios are essentially dollar neutral and beta neutral low-beta factor portfolio, respectively, and that the performances of all lowbeta factor strategies can be attributed to their exposures to these two factors. Our risk factor model also helps explain other low-beta puzzles, such as low beta high alpha, lower return with predicted beta, relationship with other risk factors, low beta and low vol connection, and so on. Because of its unique characteristics, the low-beta factor requires special consideration when combined with other factors in a multi-factor strategy. Based on the risk factor model, we propose an objective function for portfolio optimization that enables investors to take full advantage of low-beta anomaly by explicitly controlling exposure to the low-beta factor."}}

The toolkit is built atop an EMA scaffold to preserve trader familiarity while enhancing structural clarity and integrating volume dynamics. Together, these tools decouple signal from noise, make operator intent visible, and adapt seamlessly across intraday, swing, and positional timeframes without requiring traders to adopt an entirely new charting paradigm.

This paper investigated the determinants of individual savings in selected East African countries. Specifically, internet access, financial inclusion, and borrowing were the covariates while individual savings in East Africa were the predicted. This study utilized data from the Global Findex 2021 World Bank database. This dataset was selected because it is one of the most comprehensive databases on financial inclusion, providing a comprehensive view of adults' savings, borrowing, payments, and risk management across global and regional contexts. This study used a basic framework to explore the factors influencing individual savings by examining production, income distribution, and accumulation. A panel data logistic regression model was utilized, and Instrumental Variables (2SLS) regression was employed to test endogeneity. The Sargan and Basmann tests assessed overidentification restrictions to validate the instruments. Shea's partial R-squared measured the unique contribution of each instrument in explaining the variation in endogenous variables, accounting for the influence of other instruments and endogenous variables. The Hausman test which model was suitable for panel data modeling. The 2SLS regression showed no evidence of endogeneity, as internet access was insignificant with a high p-value (&gt; 0.05). Overidentification tests confirmed instrument validity with p-values of 0.1018 and 0.1016. However, Shea's partial R-squared revealed weak instruments, especially for borrowing, with an adjusted value of 0.0328. Results revealed that borrowing is strongly and positively associated with saving. The higher the borrowing, the more the savings. In East Africa, most borrowers are savers. These use the borrowed funds to create an injection of income flow through capital accumulation. Internet access significantly predicts savings in East Africa today. In this digital era, most businesses are run online. Therefore, it is almost impossible to save with no internet access. Similarly, those who use digital payment systems are most likely to enhance their savings. Age and gender do not influence the saving of an individual in East Africa. Likely, owning a financial account does not translate to more savings. Most East Africans have nonfunctional bank accounts.

Remote sensing-derived spatial layers were integrated to produce nutrient distribution maps, illustrating the localized deficiencies and excesses of key macronutrients including N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. The resulting geospatial dataset supports the development of site-specific fertilizer strategies and offers insight into the spatial variability in nutrient status across plantation blocks. The data are intended to support decision-making in precision agriculture applications, with potential use in optimizing fertilizer input, improving yield efficiency, and supporting sustainable oil palm management."}}

The estimates are based exclusively on roll-call votes related to bill proposals debated and voted on in the plenary sessions. It excludes other types of votes, such as those on non-binding agreements or investigative commissions, which do not directly contribute to lawmaking.To estimate ideological positions, the dataset includes results from three distinct methods. The first uses the classic DW-NOMINATE model [1], primarily for comparative purposes. The second applies a Bayesian model [2] to estimate latent ideological positions within each legislative period. The third introduces a dynamic model suitable for large scale data [3] that links estimates across time, allowing direct comparisons of ideological positions even when legislators served in different periods.In addition to ideological estimates, the dataset includes information on each deputy&apos;s party affiliations throughout their time in office, as well as their age and date of birth. A major electoral reform enacted during the middle of this time frame increased the number of deputies from 120 to 155. As a result, earlier periods contain fewer legislators than later ones—a structural change that enhances the dataset&apos;s value for studying institutional evolution and its effects on legislative dynamics.Each methodological approach offers a different lens to examine ideological variation and change within the Chilean legislature. The dynamic model, in particular, supports longitudinal research by enabling consistent ideological comparisons across more than two decades. Researchers can use this dataset to explore topics such as political polarization, coalition dynamics, party-system development, and the relationship between institutional reforms and representation.The structure and transparency of the dataset make it suitable for integration with other legislative or electoral databases, offering additional opportunities for analysis in political science, public policy, and institutional studies."}}

We find that shocks to median inflation expectations increase the median inflation rate for up to three years, and subsequently generate persistent upside risks in inflation that endure for more than six years. By analyzing higher-order moments; specifically, the standard deviation and skewness of inflation expectations, we show that greater disagreement among agents has distinct impacts on the distribution of the inflation rate. While an increase in the standard deviation amplifies right-tail inflation risks and generates quantile-dependent effects at the 90th percentile of the inflation distribution, a negative skewness shock temporarily shifts the distribution without any quantile-dependent effects. Our results highlight the critical importance of the distributional properties of inflation expectations for understanding and managing inflation risks. The results also underscore the need for well-anchored expectations to promote macroeconomic price stability."}}

It also looks at the effects of financial development components on FDI, such as financial institutions development and financial markets development. To evaluate these relationships, a fixed effects panel data model controlling for time and country-specific effects is applied to data from 19 member states covering the period 1991 to 2015. Based on the findings, financial development and both its components have a negative and significant effect on inward FDI. Moreover, to check the robustness of these estimations, the same estimation settings for a different period of 1996-2015 are used. The outcome demonstrates that financial development and financial institutions development have a stronger negative and significant effect on FDI. However, concerning the impact of financial markets development on FDI, no significant effect is discovered."}}

Exploiting the staggered local entry of NL into municipal elections between 1990 and 2015, we implement a difference-indifferences design to estimate the causal effect of exposure to NL's rhetoric on tax compliance. We find that NL participation leads to a significant decline in payment of the national TV license fee, a symbolically charged and centrally collected tax. The effect is absent for local taxes and unrelated parties like Forza Italia, and is not driven by NL's control of local government. The decline is amplified in municipalities with higher initial support for NL, greater exposure to its television channel, and more intense local campaign activity. The effect is also stronger in economically vulnerable communities. Taken together, the evidence points to a rhetorical mechanism: repeated exposure to a narrative that casts national taxation as cultural exploitation weakens compliance with central fiscal obligations."}}

We find that empirical discourse has increased over time, not necessarily as a marker of evidence-based policymaking, but as a strategic tool of the minority. Minority legislators-both Republican and Democrat-rely on empirical arguments more than majority legislators, and more so as the majority-minority control gap increases. Senior minority members use substantially more empirical discourse, indicating that empirical discourse is acquired as a substitute for power. Moreover, we find that majority party members (mostly Republicans) use even less empirical discourse when their party controls a trifecta of the branches of government, turning less to knowledge when fewer constraints on power exist. We find causal support for this phenomenon using an event study design: when power shifts (twice throughout the duration of our study), those who used less empirical discourse turn to using more of it, and vice versa; this is also true at the individual level for House members who survived reelection but switched from being in the minority to being in the majority or vice versa. Finally, minority legislators use especially high levels of empirical discourse when opposing majority-sponsored bills. Empirical discourse is associated with a lower likelihood of bill passage, for both majority and minority sponsored bills, suggesting that empirical arguments provide at least somewhat effective minority strategy to challenge and thwart majority initiatives. Overall, these findings support a \"Power or Knowledge\" framework, whereby the majority controls the agenda whereas the minority leverages empirical discourse to challenge dominant forces."}}

We use a two-part survey experiment to elicit respondents&apos; beliefs about local air quality and pollution&apos;s effects on life expectancy. We document how misperception differs across demographic groups and then how this misperception affects willingness to pay (WTP) for cleaner air. Since misperception or beliefs may be correlated with other unobservable determinants of WTP, we randomly show selected participants customized information about their actual air pollution. This allows us to trace out how experimentally induced changes in beliefs affect WTP for air quality. Our results suggest significant misperceptions about air pollution in the US. Respondents, on average, overestimate both their air pollution exposure and its impact on life expectancy. Beliefs about relative air pollution are not systematically biased but are noisy. Despite some differences in misperceptions between Black and White respondents, counterfactual exercises do not suggest that rectifying these misperceptions would meaningfully close the observed gap in WTP and/or pollution exposure.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34116\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Method:  A longitudinal sample consisting of 169 youth from Nova Scotia, Canada, who were receiving CWCS were surveyed annually from 2022-2024. At baseline, the mean age was 16.49 years (SD = 1.48, range = 14-19), 56.00% females, 78.10% self-identified as White, 85.50% were engaged in work and/or education, and 90.50% lived in self-directed or supported housing provided by child welfare and/or community services. Participants were grouped based on their trajectories in (A) housing and (B) engagement in work and/or education across three annual assessments. Repeated-measures ANOVAs examined within-group changes over time and between-group differences in temporal patterns of risk exposure, access to psychosocial and institutional resources, and behavioral outcomes.  Results:  In total, 62.10% of participants remained consistently engaged in work and/or education throughout the study, 5.90% were consistently not engaged, 19.00% transitioned from engaged to disengaged, and 13.00% transitioned from disengaged to engaged by the end of the study. The majority of participants, 78.40%, lived in self-directed or supported housing throughout the study, while 10.80% transitioned into unstable housing and another 10.80% transitioned from unstable to stable housing during the study. Significant differences were found between housing trajectories regarding temporal patterns of future orientation, substance use, psychological resilience, and caregiver support. However, no significant differences were observed between the engagement in work and/or education trajectories. Within-group differences were found for certain housing and engagement trajectories across several variables.  Conclusions:  The results show that helping youth who receive child welfare and community services transition into and maintain stable housing leads to improvements in access to resilience-enabling resources that support positive development and prosocial behavioral outcomes. A pattern of housing stability for youth receiving services is also associated with decreases in risk exposure, while transitioning to unstable housing is predictive of increased substance use and decreased positive future orientation."}}

The lawsuit seeks to dismantle the NFL Sunday Ticket service that supplements the league's free nationwide local telecasts with paywall-protected out-of-market games. Positing that each individual NFL team should instead create its own game telecast and independently distribute it, the Sunday Ticket plaintiffs advance theories that warp how television distribution actually works and distend the boundaries of antitrust doctrine. Permitted to go to a jury trial in June 2024, the case delivered a multi-billion-dollar verdict against the NFL. If that jury verdict stands, consider the disincentives for future sports television innovations. Would the NFL ever have launched Sunday Ticket 30 years ago if it knew more than half the license fees earned to date would be wiped out by a single doctrinally suspect jury verdict? At this writing, that verdict has been overturned by the California district court, which awarded judgment as a matter of law (JNOV) to the NFL. That JNOV ruling is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This article chronicles the history of and legal frameworks governing sports television rights and distribution. It recounts the ten-year saga of the NFL Sunday Ticket litigation, tracking arguments and rulings that rest on fallacies and fumble the antitrust analysis.

Bailouts are considered only when an externality threshold is met. With quadratic implementation costs, the static problem yields a simple \"threshold-linear-cap\" (TLC) policy: zero below a lower activation point, linear in the middle, and flat at an upper cap. We characterize a knife-edge for a complete no-bailout regime, either because the consent cap blocks all proposals or because the political cost of funds exceeds the maximum marginal benefit of relief. Comparative statics are transparent: increasing the political cost shifts activation upward; tightening the consent cap lowers the upper plateau; joint institutional changes move the two kinks in predictable ways. The WRD mechanism is observationally equivalent to TLC rules obtained from screening models, yet attributes the same geometry to representation design rather than private information. For implementation and audit, we propose a constrained two-knot spline that recovers three interpretable metrics from data-activation threshold, interior slope, and the cap level-which support routine ex-post compliance checks."}}

Even highly solvent companies have turned to bankruptcy to try to resolve their mass-tort liability and have been harshly critical of the MDL process in their filings. But MDL judges have been striking back. This essay surveys the procedural tools that MDL judges can use to protect their jurisdiction, ranging from withdrawing the bankruptcy reference for an in-district filing to anti-suit injunctions attempting to shut down a competing out-of-district bankruptcy. Of course, the bankruptcy court may return fire with stays or injunctions of its own, leading to impasse. But we see a more productive solution than mutually assured destruction. We argue that the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML)--the congressionally-designated institution for deciding where mass tort litigation should proceed--can, and should, step in to get the bankruptcy and MDL into the same judicial district. The JPML can do that by transferring the bankruptcy (or pieces of it) to the MDL district or by retransferring the MDL (along with the MDL judge who may sit by designation) to the bankruptcy district. Either option would empower the MDL judge to reassert control over the litigation by withdrawing the bankruptcy reference, if necessary, thus delineating clear lines of authority, reducing friction, and facilitating cooperation between the bankruptcy and MDL systems."}}

A just system of property protects people's rights to use resources, and it also orders those rights consistent with natural law and the public welfare. Drawing on influential property theorists such as Grotius, Locke, Blackstone, and early American statesmen and judges, as well as recent work in in normative and analytical philosophy, <u>Natural Property Rights</u> shows how natural rights guide political and legal reasoning about property law. It examines how natural rights justify the most familiar institutions in property, including public property, ownership, the system of estates and future interests, leases, servitudes, mortgages, police regulation, and eminent domain. The book studies examples familiar from the law covering tangible resources; chattels, real property, energy, and water law.

In relation to philosophy and political-theory scholarship, <u>Natural Property Rights</u> justifies property as the object of a right. But the right is not grounded in autonomy as it is in the political theories of Robert Nozick and many other libertarians; it is grounded instead in foundations associated with perfectionism, eudaimonism, and human flourishing. And the book reminds philosophers and political theorists how many factors besides analytic concepts and normative foundations matter in property; it shows how legal property rights develop from practical reasoning and the specification of general prepolitical rights.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n In relation to legal scholarship, <u>Natural Property Rights</u> offers an important alternative to the normative theories that loom largest today—Progressive property, law and economics, and&nbsp; expertise-driven approaches to property (as in <u>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe-Regional Planning Agency</u> (2002) and <u>Kelo v. New London</u> (2005)). Consistent with Progressive property, natural law and rights link property to human flourishing. But natural law and rights still justify property as the object of an individual right, and not as an entitlement to do what regulators or judges think will contribute to flourishing in the relevant community. Consistent with the best law-and-economics scholarship, natural law and rights guide reasoning about the effects of recognizing property rights in law. But natural law and rights address familiar challenges faced by law and economics—about when and why legal systems have legitimate political authority to coerce citizens, with the state’s monopoly over violence, to obey efficient rules. And natural law and rights reconcile individual property rights with the public welfare as called for in expertise-driven approaches—without threatening individual freedom as those approaches do.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n ISBN: 9781108951395\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>"}}

Amar Bhidé’s book,&nbsp;</span><i>Uncertainty and Enterprise: Venturing Beyond the Known</i><span>, does an enormous service in bringing the topic to the forefront. What are we uncertain about? Principally, about the future – we don’t know what will happen. We may not even know the range of possibilities, much less the associated probabilities. But even our construction of the past and present is often uncertain. We construct narratives regarding what happened and why, based on our present understanding of what is so—an understanding that is often significantly incomplete and subject to revision. Even the description of what happened will differ depending on the underlying causal narrative, something that affects our understanding—and planning—going forward. Why haven’t we thought more about uncertainty? Attempts to be more realistic about human behavior than the orthodox rationality paradigm could have taken uncertainty and reactions thereto, more into account; instead, the dominant focus has been on mistakes humans make, “irrationality.” Reality is straightforward—people are just getting it wrong. But reality isn’t that straightforward—again, we live in a world of uncertainty. In my book with my colleague Richard Painter on bankers’ behavior in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, we detailed why bankers had behaved as they did, given the world as it reasonably, and rationally, seemed to them, in a world of uncertainty, where they sought to maximize their employers’ well-being and their own, and there were no sufficiently agreed-upon ways to assess probabilities—at least not until it was too late. Lawmakers, regulators, and policymakers will continue to be ill-served if they do not do a better job of taking uncertainty into account.</span>"}}

This article takes a critical look at the scope of the Directive 2024/1799, and specifically into the 'obligation to repair' and its relationship with the protection of intellectual property. The obligation to repair binds primarily manufacturers of certain type of products, namely those under 'repairability requirements' that are laid down by a distinct body of regulatory measures. Its goal is to facilitate access to spare parts, repair tools and manuals so that a wider choice of repair options are available to consumers. The article analyses the mandatory nature of the obligation to repair and its practical consequences. The main shortcoming identified is derived from the legal possibility conferred on manufactures to impede repair by various means if justified by the protection of intellectual property (IP). The article focuses on the issues of 'spare parts' and 'repair' to demonstrate the difficulty of meeting the IP-compliance requirement if a party that uses a spare part within the ambit of the 'obligation of repair' under Directive 2024/1799 were to relate to the design repair clause. This example supports the argument that the most likely effect of the Directive 2024/1799 is that repairing products set under the repairability requirements will be possible on the market, yet will remain under the terms and control of the manufacturers."}}
