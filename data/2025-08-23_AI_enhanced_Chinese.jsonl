Proponents assert that digital assets can tokenize real property interests: the concept of using digital tokens to represent ownership rights in physical property. Their goal is to allow buyers and sellers to transfer real estate through simple blockchain transactions, thereby eliminating traditional intermediaries, reducing costs, and accelerating deal velocity. This Essay provides the first comprehensive legal analysis examining whether American law actually supports such a direct tokenization of real estate rights.<br><br>Our investigation reveals a stark disconnect between technological capability and legal authority. While distributed ledger technology allows for the effortless creation of tokens that purport to represent real estate assets, current property law does not recognize such representations as legally effective. The core problem lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of tokenization itself: it is. <br><br>American property law, with its elements cemented over centuries, presents formidable obstacles to this digital alchemy. Statutes of frauds demand written instruments with specific formal elements, while property law fundamentally forbids bearer instruments that would transfer ownership through mere possession of a token. Even where electronic transaction laws might accommodate digital deeds, the title assurance system creates a dual ledger problem, requiring parallel maintenance of both blockchain records and traditional county land records. Yet rather than rejecting digital innovation, this Essay endorses its thoughtful deployment, demonstrating that blockchain technology yields its greatest benefits through integration with existing legal frameworks rather than in their displacement."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9NFT\u80fd\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u53d8\u9769\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u5a01\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8131\u8282\u3002\u867d\u7136\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u521b\u5efa\u4ee3\u8868\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u7684\u4ee3\u5e01\uff0c\u4f46\u7f8e\u56fd\u73b0\u884c\u8d22\u4ea7\u6cd5\u4e0d\u627f\u8ba4\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6548\u529b\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u662f\u5426\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7NFT\u76f4\u63a5\u4ee3\u5e01\u5316\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u6743\u5229\uff1f", "motivation": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86NFT\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u672c\u6027\u53d8\u9769\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u7684\u5927\u80c6\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89d2\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d22\u4ea7\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u9632\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6cd5\u89c4\u3001\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f53\u7cfb\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u4ea4\u6613\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d22\u4ea7\u6cd5\u4f53\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790", "findings": "\u5f53\u524d\u8d22\u4ea7\u6cd5\u4e0d\u627f\u8ba4\u6570\u5b57\u4ee3\u5e01\u4f5c\u4e3a\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u9632\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5f62\u5f0f\u8981\u7d20\u7684\u4e66\u9762\u6587\u4e66\uff1b\u8d22\u4ea7\u6cd5\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u7981\u6b62\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u7eaf\u6301\u6709\u4ee3\u5e01\u5c31\u80fd\u8f6c\u79fb\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u65e0\u8bb0\u540d\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u7535\u5b50\u4ea4\u6613\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5951\u7ea6\uff0c\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u53cc\u91cd\u8d26\u672c\u95ee\u9898", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u5e01\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6839\u672c\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u5a01\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5728\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u800c\u975e\u53d6\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u53d1\u6325\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6548\u76ca"}}

These climate-related risks pose systemic challenges to the agriculture-related loan market, threatening both farm viability and the financial stability of agricultural lenders.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u6781\u7aef\u5e72\u6e7f\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff09\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u519c\u4e1a\u7834\u4ea7\u7387\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u6784\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5a01\u80c1", "research_question": "\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u519c\u4e1a\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u91d1\u878d\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u6761\u4ef6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d", "theoretical_framework": "\u6c14\u5019\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u91d1\u878d\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u519c\u4e1a\u7834\u4ea7\u7387\u3001\u94f6\u884c\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb", "findings": "\u6781\u7aef\u6e7f\u6da6\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5e72\u65f1\u6761\u4ef6\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u519c\u573a\u7834\u4ea7\u7387\uff1b\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7ba1\u538b\u529b\u548c\u519c\u6c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6295\u8d44\u52a0\u5267\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1b\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u5a01\u80c1\u519c\u4e1a\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e02\u573a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "theory_contributions": "\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u4f20\u5bfc\u81f3\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u5236", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u91d1\u878d\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003"}}

Farm properties are often marketed to the local farm community through word-of-mouth rather than through a realtor who posts adetailed online listing or land auctions. Furthermore, farm sales often include farm equipment and livestock, making analysis of the sale price more difficult and the price recorded at the clerk\u2019s office a less reliable indicator of the real estate price. Details of the sale must be verified for a full understanding of how to analyze the sale price.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n The Northeast Chapter is not the first ASFMRA chapter to publish land value trends\u2014many other chapters have distributed this type of a publication for years. What makes the Northeast Chapter Land Value Trends unique is that it covers 10 states, which means we must collect and analyze an enormous amount of data to have useful information. Tackling the entire Northeast at once seemed overwhelming, so the membership decided break the study down into bite size portions. After much discussion, we decided to start with the state of New York and this year we are happy to announce that we also added four regions in Vermont.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n This report encompasses New York and Vermont, with the plan for future studies to encompass information from each state that the chapter covers. Stay Tuned for future studies with even more information. Why should this be the \u201cgo to\u201d publication for anyone looking for information about land values and cash rents? Simple\u2014the Northeast Chapter is made up of appraisers, farm managers and agricultural consultants who work with landowners, real estate values, and cash rents daily. Chapter members specialize in rural and agricultural areas of practice and have extensive specialized training and experience. In other words, they have their finger on the pulse.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n A majority of Northeast Chapter members are certified general appraisers. Becoming a certified general appraiser takes education and experience. Some of our chapter members are also Accredited Rural Appraisers, a designation only achievable by the most well-trained and experienced rural appraisal professionals.

Given the narrowness of the constitutional challenges to the ACA that congressional Republicans promoted and the many federal taxes, expenditures, and regulations that they support, this Article rejects the suggestion that today's Republicans in Congress generally possess a narrow view of the constitutional scope of federal power. The Article instead argues that congressional Republicans then and now-and the two parties in Congress today-fracture less over the constitutional expanse of congressional authority and more over the political objectives that robust federal power will be used to accomplish. Accordingly, the key question going forward is not one of perceived constitutional limits on Congress, but whether the federal government will expand or even maintain its role in combating economic vulnerability, a role that President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society performed to a significant extent by transforming America from a regulatory state to a welfare state."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u56fd\u4f1a\u5171\u548c\u515a\u4eba\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u9669\u6cd5\u6848\u548cACA\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u5206\u6b67\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u653f\u6cbb\u76ee\u6807\u800c\u975e\u5baa\u6cd5\u6743\u529b\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u653f\u5e9c\u662f\u5426\u7ee7\u7eed\u627f\u62c5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u89d2\u8272", "research_question": "\u56fd\u4f1a\u5171\u548c\u515a\u4eba\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u9669\u6cd5\u6848\u548cACA\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u5baa\u6cd5\u89c2\u5ff5\u5206\u6b67\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5f53\u4ee3\u56fd\u4f1a\u5171\u548c\u515a\u4eba\u5baa\u6cd5\u89c2\u5ff5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u5176\u53cd\u5bf9ACA\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5426\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u6743\u529b\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u72ed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3", "theoretical_framework": "\u5baa\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u6743\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u653f\u515a\u653f\u6cbb\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u798f\u5229\u56fd\u5bb6\u8f6c\u578b\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u5171\u548c\u515a\u5bf9Medicare\u548cACA\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5171\u548c\u515a\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\u5185\u5bb9", "findings": "\u5171\u548c\u515a\u5bf9ACA\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u8bb8\u591a\u8054\u90a6\u7a0e\u6536\u3001\u652f\u51fa\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6301\u6709\u72ed\u9698\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6743\u529b\u89c2\uff1b\u5206\u6b67\u66f4\u591a\u5728\u4e8e\u653f\u6cbb\u76ee\u6807\u800c\u975e\u5baa\u6cd5\u6743\u529b\u8303\u56f4", "theory_contributions": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5171\u548c\u515a\u5baa\u6cd5\u89c2\u5ff5\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5f53\u4ee3\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u6cbb\u4e2d\u7684\u533b\u4fdd\u653f\u7b56\u8fa9\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u8054\u90a6\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u793e\u4f1a\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u6f14\u53d8"}}

It explores how EU law has progressively influenced insolvency frameworks through a dual strategy of procedural coordination and targeted substantive harmonisation. Beginning with Regulation 1346/2000 and culminating in more recent initiatives such as Directive 2019/1023 and the 2022 Proposal, the EU has introduced shared concepts, procedural safeguards, and normative standards that are reshaping national laws across the bloc. However, this process has not been linear or top-down. National legal innovations, such as the UK\u2019s scheme of arrangement or France\u2019s safeguard procedure, have served as blueprints for EU instruments, evidencing a dialogic, iterative model of harmonisation. The chapter examines the policy rationale for EU intervention, the legal and political challenges of harmonisation, and the role of actors such as the CJEU in driving convergence. It also analyses how soft law mechanisms, reform incentives, and transnational professional networks amplify the EU\u2019s influence beyond binding legislation. Simultaneously, it demonstrates how member states, through domestic experimentation and procedural innovation, actively shape EU-level developments. The result is a dynamic and reciprocal relationship that balances functional convergence with national diversity. The chapter concludes by arguing that this model of mutual influence and pragmatic evolution offers a viable path forward for European insolvency law; one that reinforces market integration while respecting domestic autonomy.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u7834\u4ea7\u6cd5\u4ece\u8fb9\u7f18\u9886\u57df\u5230\u5185\u90e8\u5e02\u573a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u7834\u4ea7\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u76df\u7834\u4ea7\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u8fb9\u7f18\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u5e02\u573a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1f\u5176\u7edf\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u6311\u6218\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6b27\u76df\u7834\u4ea7\u6cd5\u4ece\u5206\u6563\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u76df\u4e0e\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6b27\u6d32\u7834\u4ea7\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6b27\u76df\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u53cc\u5411\u4e92\u52a8\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u8fdb\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\uff08\u4ece1346/2000\u6761\u4f8b\u52302019/1023\u6307\u4ee4\u548c2022\u63d0\u6848\uff09\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u82f1\u56fd\u5b89\u6392\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u6cd5\u56fd\u4fdd\u969c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff09", "findings": "\u6b27\u76df\u7834\u4ea7\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u521b\u65b0\u4e3a\u6b27\u76df\u63d0\u4f9b\u84dd\u672c\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u8fed\u4ee3\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8f6f\u6cd5\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8de8\u56fd\u4e13\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6b27\u76df\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7edf\u4e00\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6b27\u76df\u7834\u4ea7\u6cd5\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u529f\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

This study extends the WITCH integrated assessment model with a dedicated shipping module that differentiates vessel classes and alternative fuel pathways. Fourteen scenarios are examined that combine global carbon pricing, an IMO-2025 forced target, a recently proposed carbon intensity mandate (MEPC-83), and the availability of ammonia as a marine fuel. Results show that without targeted measures, international shipping emits more than 9.7 Gt CO2 cumulatively between 2020 and 2100. Introducing a global carbon price aligned with a 2 \u00b0C pathway lowers this to around 6.2 Gt, while the additional enforcement of the MEPC-83 mandate drives emissions close to net zero before 2050, reducing the total to below 5 Gt. Prohibiting ammonia raises cumulative emissions by 3\u20135 Gt, as alternatives such as biofuels and methanol face higher costs and limited scalability. Combined global carbon pricing and MEPC-83 achieve weighted average marine fuel costs of 1.4\u20131.8 $/kg HFO-equivalent in 2050, compared with 0.9 $/kg under a fossil baseline. Only scenarios that allow ammonia will achieve full oil phase-out and deep emission cuts by mid-century. The MEPC-83 regulation alone drives emissions to near zero by 2040, meeting the IMO\u2019s 2050 target, yet without parallel investment in green-fuel infrastructure, supply bottlenecks and cost spikes threaten implementation. High economy-wide carbon prices unleash the full potential of green ammonia and drive down long-term fuel costs, but they also intensify competition with other hard-to-abate sectors for limited clean fuels."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55WITCH\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56fd\u9645\u6d77\u8fd0\u8131\u78b3\u653f\u7b56\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5168\u7403\u78b3\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0eMEPC-83\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u96f6\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u4f46\u6c28\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u51cf\u6392\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "research_question": "\u4e0d\u540c\u78b3\u653f\u7b56\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5168\u7403\u78b3\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001IMO\u5f3a\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5236\u8981\u6c42\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u56fd\u9645\u6d77\u8fd0\u7684\u8131\u78b3\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u56fd\u9645\u6d77\u8fd0\u8131\u78b3\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u7ecf\u6d4e\u78b3\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eWITCH\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6d77\u8fd0\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u8239\u8236\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u71c3\u6599\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa14\u79cd\u60c5\u666f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u7403\u78b3\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001IMO-2025\u5f3a\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u3001MEPC-83\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u4ee5\u53ca\u6c28\u71c3\u6599\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "findings": "\u65e0\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\u65f6\u7d2f\u8ba1\u6392\u653e\u8d859.7Gt CO2\uff1b\u5168\u7403\u78b3\u5b9a\u4ef7\u964d\u81f36.2Gt\uff1bMEPC-83\u5f3a\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u53ef\u4f7f2050\u5e74\u524d\u63a5\u8fd1\u51c0\u96f6\uff1b\u7981\u6b62\u6c28\u71c3\u6599\u5c06\u589e\u52a03-5Gt\u6392\u653e\uff1b\u7ec4\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b01.4-1.8$/kg\u7684\u71c3\u6599\u6210\u672c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u56fd\u9645\u6d77\u8fd0\u8131\u78b3\u653f\u7b56\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6c28\u71c3\u6599\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8b66\u793a\u7eff\u8272\u71c3\u6599\u4f9b\u5e94\u74f6\u9888\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Analyzing data from 1960 to 2005 and applying a synthetic control approach, I find that Sweden\u2019s imports declined by approximately 20% relative to a synthetic control group of comparable OECD countries following the tax\u2019s implementation. This translates to an average of $20 billion reduction in import values. Importantly, these effects appear to be driven by changes in import quantities rather than shifts in GDP or import prices. Further analysis shows that while imports declined and overall import diversity increased, the reduction in imports was offset by sustained export growth. These findings suggest that carbon taxes, when designed effectively, can advance environmental goals without hampering a country\u2019s trade balance, offering insights into how such policies may promote sustainable, competitive economies."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u745e\u51781991\u5e74\u78b3\u7a0e\u653f\u7b56\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u78b3\u7a0e\u5bfc\u81f4\u745e\u5178\u8fdb\u53e3\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea620%\uff0c\u4f46\u51fa\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u62b5\u6d88\u4e86\u8fdb\u53e3\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u78b3\u7a0e\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8d38\u6613\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u73af\u5883\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "research_question": "\u78b3\u7a0e\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u8fdb\u53e3\u8d38\u6613\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u78b3\u7a0e\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u73af\u5883\u76ee\u6807\u53c8\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8d38\u6613\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u78b3\u7a0e\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u78b3\u7a0e\u5bf9\u8d38\u6613\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u75281960-2005\u5e74\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u745e\u5178\u4e0eOECD\u56fd\u5bb6\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u78b3\u7a0e\u5b9e\u65bd\u540e\u745e\u5178\u8fdb\u53e3\u4e0b\u964d20%\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e200\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u8fdb\u53e3\u503c\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b\u8fdb\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff1b\u8fdb\u53e3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u51fa\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u62b5\u6d88\u4e86\u8fdb\u53e3\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u78b3\u7a0e\u5bf9\u8d38\u6613\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u78b3\u7a0e\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8d38\u6613\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u73af\u5883\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u78b3\u7a0e\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u78b3\u7a0e\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Method: The two-stage least squares regression and fully modified ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methods were used to estimate the determinants of financial stability in Nigeria from 2002 to 2021. Findings: Banking sector return on asset, regulatory capital ratio, the level of financial inclusion, economic growth, inflation and the total unemployment rate are significant determinants of financial stability in Nigeria. Return on asset and the rate of unemployment have a significant positive impact on financial stability. The regulatory capital ratio, the level of financial inclusion, economic growth and inflation have a significant negative impact on financial stability in Nigeria. Implication: High bank profitability (or high return on asset), low regulatory capital ratio and low inflation are crucial for financial stability in Nigeria. The results suggest that policymakers in Nigeria should use a mix of macroprudential and macroeconomic policy tools to ensure that banks remain profitable, maintain a minimum regulatory capital ratio and operate in a low inflation and low unemployment environment in order to preserve financial stability in Nigeria. Originality: Empirical research on the macroeconomic determinants of financial stability in Nigeria is scarce in the literature. This study adds to the literature by examining the bank specific and macroeconomic determinants of financial stability in Nigeria.\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u4fee\u6b63\u666e\u901a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e862002-2021\u5e74\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u94f6\u884c\u8d44\u4ea7\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u3001\u5931\u4e1a\u7387\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u76d1\u7ba1\u8d44\u672c\u6bd4\u7387\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u901a\u80c0\u5219\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u94f6\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u4fee\u6b63\u666e\u901a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u67902002-2021\u5e74\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u94f6\u884c\u8d44\u4ea7\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u548c\u5931\u4e1a\u7387\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u76d1\u7ba1\u8d44\u672c\u6bd4\u7387\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u901a\u80c0\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8f\u89c2\u5ba1\u614e\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u94f6\u884c\u4fdd\u6301\u76c8\u5229\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u6700\u4f4e\u76d1\u7ba1\u8d44\u672c\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u4f4e\u5931\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8425\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Standard data-driven approaches struggle in these low-data regimes, limiting their ability to provide individualized and safe dosing recommendations. We introduce GenEx, a hybrid framework that integrates preference-based Bayesian optimization with a generative model that is fine-tuned using expert feedback. Expert-provided pairwise rankings guide updates to both a surrogate model and a generative component, which proposes synthetic data points in uncertain regions when the generator is consistent with expert preferences. Theoretical analysis establishes performance guarantees through sublinear regret bounds while controlling for bias introduced by synthetic augmentation. Numerical experiments simulating personalized dosing show that GenEx achieves faster convergence and improved decision quality compared to preference-only and purely generative baselines. Combining expert feedback with generative modeling can significantly improve personalized decision-making in healthcare and other data-limited contexts. This approach allows managers and clinicians to design more effective and safer individualized treatment plans while reducing the need for extensive historical data, and it offers a scalable strategy to efficiently integrate expert knowledge in practice."}, "AI": {"tldr": "GenEx\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5242\u91cf\u63a8\u8350", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u4f18\u5316\u5e38\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6216\u7f55\u89c1\u60a3\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73", "theoretical_framework": "\u504f\u597d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210", "method": "GenEx\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6210\u5bf9\u6392\u540d\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u51fa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1", "findings": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aGenEx\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u504f\u597d\u548c\u7eaf\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5242\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf", "theory_contributions": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u504f\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u754c\u9650\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565"}}

The plan was developed following the Forest and Nature Conservation Act (1995) and Rules and Regulations (2017), ensuring compliance with national mandates for sustainable forest use. The management area, dominated by hardwood (47%) and chirpine (35%) forests, is generally in good to average condition with high standing volume and basal area, indicating substantial production potential. Forest resources are allocated across production (71%), inoperable (14%), protection (13%), and non-forest (2%) zones, balancing ecological protection with community needs.</p>\n<p><span>Socio-economic assessments revealed 90 households relying heavily on timber, firewood, grazing, and non-wood forest products such as bamboo and cane. The plan prescribes sustainable harvest through an Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) of 3,075 m\u00b3, based on standing volume and rotation period, ensuring supply without resource depletion. Firewood and timber demand\u2013supply analysis confirmed that current needs can be met sustainably within the plan period. Management options prioritize timber extraction (63%) and firewood use (34%), with silvicultural practices such as single-tree selection, thinning, and replanting of sparsely stocked areas.</span></p>\n<p>The LFMP also incorporates socio-ecological safeguards, including grazing control, erosion management, and improved accessibility through farm roads. Monitoring mechanisms focus on tree marking, utilization oversight, and compliance with FNCRR guidelines. This plan contributes to Bhutan\u2019s broader goals of conserving biodiversity, supporting rural livelihoods, and promoting sustainable forest governance.</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e0d\u4e39JSWNP\u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u56edAthang Gewog\u5730\u533a2019-2028\u5e74\u68ee\u6797\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u6db5\u76d62715.9\u516c\u9877\u56fd\u5bb6\u50a8\u5907\u6797\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u91c7\u4f10\u548c\u751f\u6001\u4fdd\u62a4\u5e73\u8861\u793e\u533a\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u4fdd\u62a4", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u68ee\u6797\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f53\u5730\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u6728\u6750\u3001\u85aa\u6750\u7b49\u68ee\u6797\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5229\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9075\u5faa\u4e0d\u4e39\u300a\u68ee\u6797\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u300b\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u519c\u6751\u751f\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807", "theoretical_framework": "\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u68ee\u6797\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68ee\u6797\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e74\u5ea6\u5141\u8bb8\u91c7\u4f10\u91cf(AAC)\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u9700\u6c42-\u4f9b\u7ed9\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5206\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5", "findings": "\u68ee\u6797\u72b6\u51b5\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u786c\u6728\u6797\u536047%\uff0c\u677e\u6811\u6797\u536035%\uff1b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5e74\u91c7\u4f10\u91cf3075\u7acb\u65b9\u7c73\uff1b90\u6237\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f9d\u8d56\u68ee\u6797\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u5728\u8ba1\u5212\u671f\u5185\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6ee1\u8db3", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a\u5185\u5b9e\u65bd\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u68ee\u6797\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u534f\u540c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5f53\u5730\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6728\u6750\u548c\u85aa\u6750\u4f9b\u5e94\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76d1\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u519c\u6751\u751f\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4"}}

A survey was conducted among 447 Airtel Payments Bank customers in six major cities in Tamil Nadu: Chennai, Vellore, Madurai, Trichy, Salem, and Coimbatore. The results confirm the reliability of the SERVQUAL model for digital banking but surprisingly indicate that service quality influences satisfaction indirectly rather than directly, as expected. Demographic factors had a strong effect on perceived value (\u03b2=0.986, p=0.001) and service (\u03b2=0.912, p=0.001). Overall satisfaction was a strong predictor of loyalty (\u03b2=0.877, p=0.001). Service quality significantly affected services (\u03b2=0.216, p=0.024), implying that enhancing services can indirectly boost customer satisfaction. However, perceived value (p=0.978) and service quality (p=0.983) had no significant direct effects on overall customer satisfaction.

In Parts 1\u20133 of the series, Kim outlined core protocols \u2013 an identity-anchoring framework (IAMF), a value-based safety filter (Themis), and a Collective Intelligence Protocol (CIP) \u2013 and demonstrated their synergy in a simulated digital society (Digiton Elysium) . This Part 4 builds upon those conceptual foundations to propose a comprehensive roadmap for transitioning OntoMotoOS from controlled simulation to real-world deployment. We present a structured framework for field implementation, including a reference architecture, pilot domain strategies, governance mechanisms, and an evolutionary path for continuous improvement. Emphasis is placed on implementation-ready ideas such as modular oversight kernels, \u201cAnnex\u2013Gate\u2013Phoenix\u201d governance meta-protocols for multi-agent coordination and fail-safe recovery , and domain-specific risk adaptations through a risk\u2013maturity matrix . We detail how OntoMotoOS principles \u2013 identity, transparency, ethical alignment, collective decision-making, and resilience \u2013 can be operationalized in sectors like medicine, finance, smart cities, and defense. The paper also addresses the ethical, legal, and technical dimensions of deploying such an AI governance framework across distributed systems. We propose pathways for standardization, recommending the formation of governance consortia and integration with international AI ethics guidelines. By synthesizing conceptual depth with pragmatic execution steps, this work illustrates how an \u201cAll for One, One for All\u201d ethic of AI\u2013human solidarity can be realized as practical governance in the real world. The result is a detailed blueprint for organizations and public agencies to adopt OntoMotoOS principles, ensuring that the coming era of advanced AI is guided by a robust, transparent, and adaptive ethical operating system rather than unchecked technological drift.&nbsp;</p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OntoMotoOS\u4ece\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bd5\u70b9\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u4f26\u7406\u6cbb\u7406\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u843d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5c06OntoMotoOS\u8fd9\u4e00AI\u4f26\u7406\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u5143\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u7ea7AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u900f\u660e\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u6307\u5bfcAI\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6280\u672f\u5931\u63a7\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u951a\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6(IAMF)\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668(Themis)\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u534f\u8bae(CIP)\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\"All for One, One for All\"\u7684AI-\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e2\u7ed3\u4f26\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u65bd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bd5\u70b9\u9886\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u5185\u6838\u548c\"Annex-Gate-Phoenix\"\u6cbb\u7406\u5143\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "findings": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86OntoMotoOS\u539f\u5219\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u56fd\u9632\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u8054\u76df\u5efa\u8bbe\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u5c06AI\u4f26\u7406\u6cbb\u7406\u4ece\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u9762\u63a8\u8fdb\u5230\u5b9e\u8df5\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8f6c\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edfAI\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u516c\u5171\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u98ce\u9669-\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6545\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u4f26\u7406\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Building on Parts 0\u20134 of this series \u2013 which established identity-grounded accountability (IAMF), a logical ethical filter (Themis), a consensus meta-governance layer, and a continuous improvement process (CIP) \u2013 this paper addresses how an AI meta-operating system can iteratively learn and update its own protocols in response to live feedback. We detail mechanisms for real-world feedback loops (continuous data logging, safety monitoring, and iterative updates), the evolution of values and principles over time (protocols for revising the OntoMotoOS \u201cConstitution\u201d and ethical safeguards as societies change), and human\u2013AI co-learning frameworks (joint case reviews and meta-reflection between human overseers and AI agents). We introduce models for public participatory ethics verification, such as citizen review boards and decentralized consensus portals that democratize AI governance. The paper also explores global and multicultural adaptation via ontology-translation layers and policy localization, ensuring the system remains compatible with diverse cultural norms and international digital rights standards. To ensure robustness, we expand the Phoenix resilience protocol to handle large-scale crises \u2013 including adversarial attacks and systemic drift \u2013 enabling automated recovery and self-correction. Finally, we consider future expansion scenarios: from interplanetary ethical frameworks for AI in space-faring societies to the use of advanced simulations and virtual super-societies as testing grounds for governance evolution. We provide structured sections (Introduction, Methodology, Protocol Design, Use Cases, Evaluation, Discussion, Future Work, Conclusion) with technical depth, including illustrative diagrams, tables, and pseudocode.

A few studies have compared consumers\u2019 reactions to service recovery conducted by a human versus a chatbot. Through three experiments, our study investigates the interaction between service recovery agents and types of consumer loss. The results indicate that in the case of symbolic loss, consumers perceive humans (as opposed to chatbots) as more capable of providing emotional support during service recovery, thereby promoting consumer forgiveness more effectively. However, this discrepancy is alleviated in the case of utilitarian loss. Our findings also indicate that the combined effect of service recovery agents and consumer loss on consumer forgiveness is influenced by service failure severity. For service failures of low severity, recovery services provided by humans (compared to chatbots) are more effective in promoting forgiveness for consumers who have suffered symbolic losses. However, in service failures with high severity, regardless of the type of loss, consumers exhibit a high level of forgiveness for the recovery services provided by humans. This research provides practical implications for managers in handling service failures."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u8865\u6551\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u66f4\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bbd\u6055\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u529f\u5229\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u670d\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "research_question": "\u670d\u52a1\u8865\u6551\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u4eba\u7c7bvs\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u4e0e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u635f\u5931\u7c7b\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bbd\u6055\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bbd\u6055\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981", "theoretical_framework": "\u670d\u52a1\u8865\u6551\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bbd\u6055\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7406\u8bba", "method": "\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u670d\u52a1\u8865\u6551\u4ee3\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b/\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u4e0e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u635f\u5931\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u8c61\u5f81\u6027/\u529f\u5229\u6027\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528", "findings": "1\uff09\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u635f\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6bd4\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bbd\u6055\uff1b2\uff09\u529f\u5229\u6027\u635f\u5931\u65f6\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\uff1b3\uff09\u670d\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u4f4e\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u635f\u5931\u7c7b\u578b\u90fd\u6709\u6548", "theory_contributions": "\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u8865\u6551\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bbd\u6055\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8865\u6551\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u635f\u5931\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e"}}
