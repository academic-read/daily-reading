While the previous studies focused mainly on rational and cognitive determinants of EV adoption, the roles of pro-environmental self-identity and pro-environmental knowledge in shaping purchase intention remain underexplored, especially in developing countries. Based on survey data from 516 participants in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi (Vietnam), this study examines how pro-environmental identity (as a value) affects pro-environmental attitude and purchase intention of EV, the mediating effect of pro-environmental attitude, and the moderating role of pro-environmental knowledge. The structural equation modeling results show that pro-environmental identity significantly predicts both pro-environmental attitude and EV purchase intention, with pro-environmental attitude acting as an important mediator. Moreover, pro-environmental knowledge also strengthens the impact of both pro-environmental self-identity and pro-environmental attitude on EV purchase intention. These findings highlight the importance of combining value-based solutions and enhancing pro-environmental knowledge to promote sustainable consumption behaviour. The study provides theoretical insights into the VAB framework and offers practical implications for policymakers and marketers in encouraging EV adoption in emerging markets."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c-\u6001\u5ea6-\u884c\u4e3a\uff08VAB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5fc3\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8d2d\u4e70\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\uff08EV\uff09\u7684\u73af\u4fdd\u610f\u613f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u73af\u4fdd\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u540c\u548c\u73af\u4fdd\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "research_question": "\u5fc3\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u73af\u4fdd\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u540c\u548c\u73af\u4fdd\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8d2d\u4e70\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u73af\u4fdd\u610f\u613f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u7406\u6027\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u73af\u4fdd\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u540c\u548c\u73af\u4fdd\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ef7\u503c-\u6001\u5ea6-\u884c\u4e3a\uff08VAB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d8a\u5357\u80e1\u5fd7\u660e\u5e02\u548c\u6cb3\u5185516\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u73af\u4fdd\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u540c\u663e\u8457\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u4fdd\u6001\u5ea6\u548cEV\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u73af\u4fdd\u6001\u5ea6\u8d77\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u73af\u4fdd\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u73af\u4fdd\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u540c\u548c\u6001\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u613f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86VAB\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u73af\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5fc3\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u8425\u9500\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u4fc3\u8fdbEV\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The risk associated with the failure of\u00a0the entire banking network when one of its members collapses is known as\u00a0systemic risk. Quantifying it is a challenging task due to the complex interconnections\u00a0among banks, whose data is not always publicly available. In a\u00a0novel departure from the literature, we employ quantile regression neural networks\u00a0to estimate value-at-risk (VaR) of banks and use the same to estimate\u00a0their conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR). We then identify\u00a0 banks with high\u00a0systemic risk exposure and contribution using the published metrics. For\u00a0the first time, (i) we invoke SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis\u00a0to incorporate explainability aspects in the trained models, (ii) generatecounterfactual scenarios to help decision-makers mitigate systemic risk under\u00a0the causal inference framework, and (iii) employ the network centrality\u00a0measures to assess the interconnectedness among the banks. In this work,\u00a0we use publicly available data to quantify systemic risk in a network of 24\u00a0Indian banks from 2019 to 2024. We identify banks with high systemic risk\u00a0exposure and contribution. We empirically establish the importance of incorporating\u00a0non-linearity in estimating VaR. Finally, we use the real-world\u00a0events that occurred in the Indian banking industry between 2019 and 2024\u00a0to corroborate our empirical findings."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cSHAP\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u94f6\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94f6\u884c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u91cf\u5316\u94f6\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94f6\u884c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u94f6\u884c\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001SHAP\u5206\u6790\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f30\u8ba1\u94f6\u884cVaR\u548cCoVaR\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94f6\u884c\u3002", "findings": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5370\u5ea624\u5bb6\u94f6\u884c\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u8d21\u732e\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u94f6\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VaR\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06SHAP\u5206\u6790\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027VaR\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7f13\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

As manufacturing processes grow more complex and dynamic, accurate real-time anomaly detection becomes critical for maintaining yield and reliability. However, conventional statistical methods lack adaptability in dynamic process conditions, while deep learning models are typically too resource-intensive for edge deployment. Herein, we present a lightweight yet robust AI-based anomaly detection framework for real-time, sensor-specific semiconductor manufacturing. Our framework incorporates a four-layer convolutional neural network trained on unsupervised dual-segment inputs with hierarchical layer-wise objectives. Using only 3,783 parameters for 49 input features, the framework achieves 99.90% accuracy and an F1 score of 82.14%, reducing false alarms by up to 10.3 times and 4.0 times compared to the convolutional autoencoder control and industrial statistical model baseline, respectively. We further introduce a computationally efficient method for generating labeled virtual data to enable sensor-wise adaptive thresholding under imbalanced data conditions.

The concept of the certifier\u2019s revision dilemma is introduced to describe the strategic decision situation where the standard-setting organization balances the complexity of the standard and the time given to the adopters to strategically realign with the revised standard. Complexity-time ambiguities and feedback delays result in a strategic realignment blind spot, which causes a decline in adopters following standard revision. A model is developed to simulate standard adoption and strategic realignment dynamics using the case of the standard revision of the Nordic Swan Ecolabel. The model estimates that the gap between the status quo and baseline scenarios is largest in two years after the publication of the revised standard, when adopters will be around a fifth less than they would have been without the revision.

However, its success heavily relies on the availability of large-scale labeled data. Labeling data is a time-consuming and costly process, prompting numerous studies aimed at reducing these expenses. Active learning is a prominent data-efficient learning methodology that has garnered significant attention. Active learning methods iteratively select data that are most effective for training models, thereby gradually constructing a compact dataset. It typically assumes the presence of a small amount of labeled data at the start of training, and experiments generally use randomly composed initial labeled datasets. Although the importance of initial dataset construction is well recognized because of its impact on the level of model training in most active learning methods, practical research in this area remains limited. In this study, we propose a method of data initialization using self-supervised learning from an active learning perspective. This method focuses on constructing a small initial dataset that maximizes learning efficiency by utilizing an unlabeled dataset. The impact of the proposed method on active learning was evaluated using a representative image classification dataset, which demonstrated significant performance improvements."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5c0f\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5c0f\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "findings": "\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Compared with traditional ESG rating methods, the TF-IDF algorithm can effectively overcome the limitations of subjectivity and strategic disclosure, and accurately identify the \u2018greenwashing\u2019 behavior of corporate ESG disclosure through text mining technology. The results of this study show that there is a significant negative impact between the degree of \u2018greenwashing\u2019 in corporate ESG disclosure and TFP, which is more obvious in companies with CEOs who have no overseas experience and high financing constraints, and that an increase in the proportion of shares held by institutional investors is an important potential path to alleviate the negative impact between the two. This paper enriches the economic consequences of \u2018greenwashing\u2019 of corporate ESG disclosure and provides a theoretical and practical basis for enterprises to improve TFP and practice the concept of high-quality development."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e2009-2022\u5e74A\u80a1\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TF-IDF\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4f01\u4e1aESG\u62ab\u9732\u4e2d\u7684\u2018\u6f02\u7eff\u2019\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4e0e\u5168\u8981\u7d20\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff08TFP\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u2018\u6f02\u7eff\u2019\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0eTFP\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6301\u80a1\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d1f\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "research_question": "\u4f01\u4e1aESG\u62ab\u9732\u4e2d\u7684\u2018\u6f02\u7eff\u2019\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5168\u8981\u7d20\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff08TFP\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfESG\u8bc4\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7TF-IDF\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u2018\u6f02\u7eff\u2019\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f01\u4e1aESG\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0eTFP\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528TF-IDF\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u2018\u6f02\u7eff\u2019\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0eTFP\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "\u2018\u6f02\u7eff\u2019\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0eTFP\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14CEO\u65e0\u6d77\u5916\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u9ad8\u878d\u8d44\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6301\u80a1\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d1f\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1aESG\u2018\u6f02\u7eff\u2019\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u540e\u679c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u5347TFP\u548c\u8df5\u884c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u5ff5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6301\u80a1\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7f13\u89e3\u2018\u6f02\u7eff\u2019\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose PFT-Net (Progressive Feature-Tiling Network), a novel approach that progressively restores missing geometry while preserving high-fidelity structural details. The network employs a Feature Tiling Mechanism that integrates locally observed points with the stacked center coordinates of missing regions, guiding the completion process without compromising observed structural information. Additionally, a dedicated Patch Feature Integration module aggregates multi-scale local and global features, significantly enhancing reconstruction accuracy. To better reflect real-world conditions, we introduce the Degradation Dataset, simulating occlusion and distance-induced sparsity commonly observed in practical 3D sensing scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including PCN, ShapeNet-55, KITTI, and the proposed Degradation Dataset, show that PFT-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, completeness, and generalization. Notably, PFT-Net achieves a 4.1% increase in F-Score and a 19.8% reduction in CD-l2 on the Degradation Dataset, as well as a 5.0% improvement in F-Score and a 13.3% reduction in CD-l2 on the PCN dataset. These results demonstrate the robustness of PFT-Net in handling incomplete and degraded point clouds, offering a powerful solution for real-world 3D completion tasks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "PFT-Net\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u94fa\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u94fa\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5df2\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fee\u590d\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u906e\u6321\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\uff09\u662f3D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u7f3a\u5931\u51e0\u4f55\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u94fa\u673a\u5236\uff08Feature Tiling Mechanism\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08Patch Feature Integration module\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPFT-Net\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u94fa\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Degradation Dataset\u6a21\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "findings": "PFT-Net\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982Degradation Dataset\u4e0aF-Score\u63d0\u53474.1%\uff0cCD-l2\u964d\u4f4e19.8%\uff1bPCN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF-Score\u63d0\u53475.0%\uff0cCD-l2\u964d\u4f4e13.3%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u94fa\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "PFT-Net\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u9000\u5316\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

However, behaviour change strategies are often underprioritized in intervention planning, and their development is rarely well documented, limiting transparency, replication, and contextual adaptation. This study presents the systematic development of a Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) intervention designed to support community volunteers in promoting household waste segregation in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) in urban India. Guided by the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) and the GUIDED reporting framework, we integrated findings from IEC material reviews, 18 key informant interviews, focus group discussions, co-design workshops, and expert consultations. Barriers were analysed using the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability-Behaviour (MOAB) model, and APEASE criteria informed intervention design. Key strategies included education, persuasion, enablement, and environmental restructuring.
