Four of the pieces from the special issue, discussed below, are available in the attached. <br><br>In their introductory editorial, \u201cProcurement Trade Agreements and Their Discontents,\u201d Robert Anderson (Honorary Professor at the University of Nottingham School of Law, and Senior Fellow, Competition and Innovation Lab, The George Washington University, and former team lead at the WTO on the Government Procurement Agreement) and Christopher Yukins (GW Law) put the accompanying articles into context. They noted that the GPA, as the premier trade agreement, \u201cis currently under an unprecedented degree of scrutiny on the part of one of its founding Parties, . . . the United States,\u201d which calls for a \u201cspirited defence . . . of the GPA and other trade agreements embodying government procurement commitments and their contribution to international governance and prosperity.\u201d<br><br>In her piece, \u201cExpansion of International Procurement Commitments: WTO Procurement Agreement Versus Free Trade Agreements,\u201d Jean Heilman Grier (Djaghe, LLC), argued that the large numbers of nations that have committed to open their government markets to foreign suppliers \u201creflects the important role that government procurement plays in international trade.\u201d She noted that while \u201cthe GPA will continue to add new members\u2014albeit slowly, [free trade agreements (FTAs)] will provide the principal expansion of international procurement commitments, as they encompass both GPA parties and those outside the plurilateral agreement.\u201d Although the GPA\u2019s membership \u201cmay be outpaced by FTAs\u201d which she described in detail, Jean Grier wrote that the GPA \u201cwill continue to serve as the international gold standard for government procurement provisions and the foundation for procurement rules across the globe.\u201d She cautioned, though, that the \u201cpotential spoiler is the United States with President Trump\u2019s America First trade policy undermining existing agreements and threatening withdrawal from the GPA and even the WTO.\u201d<br><br>In their piece on bid protests and the trade agreements, \u201cThe GPA\u2019s Domestic Review Procedures Through the Lens of North American Sub-Central Implementation: Flexibility or Incoherence?,\u201d Derek McKee (Facult\u00e9 de droit, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al) and Daniel Schoeni (University of Dayton) noted that although the GPA \u201crequires parties to give foreign suppliers access to independent and impartial fora where they can challenge public procurement decisions,\u201d many U.S. states and Canadian provinces \u2014 though both countries are members of the GPA \u201chave domestic review procedures that comply with some, but not all,\u201d of the GPA\u2019s requirements. They place part of the blame on ambiguities in Article XVIII of the GPA, and provide examples of North American sub-central review systems that embody these ambiguities.<br><br>The final piece, \u201cAn Empirical Study of Bid Protests by Disappointed Tenderers in US States,\u201d by Daniel Schoeni (University of Dayton), was an extension of Professor Schoeni\u2019s doctoral research at the University of Nottingham. In it, he reported on data he gathered on bid protests (challenges) in the states, and noted that bid protests are \u201cat least as common at the state level as at the federal level.\u201d Knowing that \u2014 that protests are a commonly available remedy for uncompetitive discrimination at the state level \u2014 could, Professor Schoeni noted, \u201cfoster confidence among foreign suppliers and thus encourage greater participation from abroad.\u201d<br><br>This extract containing an editorial and three articles was first published by Thomson Reuters in the Public Procurement Law Review at the citation noted, and is reproduced with permission of the publishers."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u671f\u300a\u516c\u5171\u91c7\u8d2d\u6cd5\u8bc4\u8bba\u300b\u7279\u520a\u805a\u7126\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e0e\u91c7\u8d2d\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u7bc7\u793e\u8bba\u548c\u4e09\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u653f\u5e9c\u91c7\u8d2d\u534f\u8bae\uff08GPA\uff09\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "research_question": "\u653f\u5e9c\u91c7\u8d2d\u534f\u8bae\uff08GPA\uff09\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e2d\u653f\u5e9c\u91c7\u8d2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0cGPA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u534f\u8bae\u9762\u4e34\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u81ea\u7531\u8d38\u6613\u534f\u5b9a\uff08FTA\uff09\u7684\u6269\u5f20\u4e5f\u5bf9GPA\u6784\u6210\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4ee5\u653f\u5e9c\u91c7\u8d2d\u534f\u8bae\uff08GPA\uff09\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7531\u8d38\u6613\u534f\u5b9a\uff08FTA\uff09\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u56fd\u9645\u91c7\u8d2d\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u8bba\u548c\u4e13\u9898\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8GPA\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u3002", "findings": "1.

This research presents a novel flow-constrained risk management framework that enables systematic improvement of operational technology security within realistic organisational limitations. Building on lean manufacturing optimisation principles, the framework constrains security improvements through work-in-progress limitations: exactly one major improvement per quarter per asset, plus a maximum of three minor improvements in parallel. The approach integrates progressive Annual Loss Exposure refinement with multi-criteria stakeholder decision-making to provide measurable progress without requiring lengthy strategic investment cycles. The framework addresses four critical implementation gaps: systematic underestimation of resource constraints, reliance on non-existent representative datasets, insufficient recognition of behavioural biases, and dependence on strategic approval processes mismatched to threat response timelines. Mathematical analysis examines the convergence properties of the progressive risk assessment methodology, whilst queuing theory validates the efficiency improvements of the flow-constrained approach. Implementation feasibility was demonstrated within a global conglomerate operating across energy, mining, and manufacturing sectors. The framework provides the theoretical foundation for achieving systematic security enhancement within practical constraints, enabling board-level visibility through consistent risk reduction trends whilst avoiding contentious resource allocation debates."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6d41\u7ea6\u675f\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u76ca\u5236\u9020\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u5b63\u5ea6\u6bcf\u9879\u8d44\u4ea7\u53ea\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u91cd\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u6b21\u5e76\u884c\u5c0f\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5e74\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u66b4\u9732\u7cbe\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u672f\u5b89\u5168\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u4e25\u91cd\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u76ca\u5236\u9020\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u5219\u548c\u6392\u961f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d41\u7ea6\u675f\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5e74\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u66b4\u9732\u7cbe\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "findings": "\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u6392\u961f\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6d41\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5168\u7403\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u91c7\u77ff\u548c\u5236\u9020\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8de8\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8b\u52bf\u5b9e\u73b0\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u3002"}}

Though these IEEPA tariffs went to immediate effect, the legal questions surrounding Trump's choice of authority have abounded. The history of the statute, the history of tariff litigation, and the Supreme Court's major questions doctrine all contribute to the foregoing analysis of whether this broad emergency action was actually legal.

The necessity to pay for products and services online initiated the shift from cash-based to electronic-based business transactions. Yet, existing research primarily focuses on adoption and technology rather than the experiential and strategic dimensions of payments. This paper uses the Experience Value Matrix (EVM), which integrates Pine and Gilmore&apos;s four realms of experience with an adoption of Woodruff&apos;s dynamic customer value framework to position payment methods not just by usage but by experience. Based on panel data from Germany and the Netherlands, the study reveals that few dominant payment methods shape over 90% of online transactions, with large variances in experience perception. The findings offer strategic guidance for wallet providers and merchants on how to align payment experiences with brand promises, pricing models, and consumer expectations. This paper takes the position that more and more payment methods are omni-channel ready (available both online and offline) and that the actual positioning of the payment method and related pricing allows for further differentiation from an experience perspective. The EVM framework invites managers to reframe payments as strategic assets that drive both customer satisfaction and business growth. By linking value perception with experience design, businesses can position payments as a final frontier in customer experience innovation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5546\u52a1\u4e2d\u652f\u4ed8\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u8d2d\u4e70\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u9a8c\u4ef7\u503c\u77e9\u9635\uff08EVM\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u4f53\u9a8c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "research_question": "\u652f\u4ed8\u65b9\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u9a8c\u4ef7\u503c\u77e9\u9635\uff08EVM\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u5ba2\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u8d2d\u4e70\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u652f\u4ed8\u6280\u672f\u7684\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u6218\u7565\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408Pine\u548cGilmore\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u4f53\u9a8c\u9886\u57df\u4e0eWoodruff\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u4ef7\u503c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4f53\u9a8c\u4ef7\u503c\u77e9\u9635\uff08EVM\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fb7\u56fd\u548c\u8377\u5170\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u4f53\u9a8c\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "findings": "\u5c11\u6570\u4e3b\u6d41\u652f\u4ed8\u65b9\u5f0f\u5360\u636e\u4e8690%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u4f46\u4f53\u9a8c\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EVM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u652f\u4ed8\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4f53\u9a8c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6218\u7565\u8d44\u4ea7\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u94b1\u5305\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u548c\u5546\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u4ed8\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0e\u54c1\u724c\u627f\u8bfa\u3001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u671f\u671b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6218\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While voice interactions serve as a rich source of behavioral signals during early customer engagement, their unstructured and multimodal nature presents significant analytical challenges. This study introduces CogniAffect Dual-Involvement Prediction (CADIP), a novel, theory-driven approach for forecasting customer purchase decisions based on voice interaction data. Grounded in involvement theory, CADIP identifies and models two latent behavioral dimensions embedded in voice interactions: cognitive engagement and affective arousal. CADIP leverages the multimodal capabilities of large language models and large speech models to extract both linguistic and acoustic features. It captures cognitive engagement through an attention mechanism that treats proactive inquiries as contextual queries, and it detects arousal expression via a dedicated arousal-gating module that dynamically modulate vocal cues to reflect affective intensity. Together, these mechanisms form a dual-pathway architecture designed to detect nuanced signals of customer involvement from early-stage dialogues. We evaluate CADIP using real-world automotive sales call data and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in identifying high-potential customers at the early decision stage. Ablation analyses further demonstrate the value of combining cognitive and affective signals, as well as the benefits of cross-modal integration.

People from all over the world can access information and news on any topic simultaneously, in a matter of seconds, and share their opinions on any subject, without any restrictions. At first glance, this underlines the importance of freedom of expression and information as a reflection of the digital age. Having said that, it doesn't always lead to positive outcomes for everyone, as it creates a crucial conflict between those who seek to access, share, and publish information and those who are part of the information and are exposed to its negative effects throughout their lives. People, who were unable to integrate into society due to being part of the negative information published about them on the internet permanently, needed a correction mechanism to rectify this and re-create their identity in the digital environment. This mechanism has been established as the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d and regulated under European law in detail. Although this is a correction mechanism for people, who have been negatively affected by the information published on the internet about them, and despite the freedom of expression and information has been regulated as an exception to this right under European law, it\u2019s indeed a compelling and complicated evaluation to decide which of these rights should prevail in each case. From this point of view, in this article, the right to be forgotten and the right of freedom of expression and information are evaluated under European law, and the conflict between them is addressed in light of the perspective developed by European law over the years, based on regulations and case law, in order to strike a fair balance.&nbsp;</span></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\u2018\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u2019\u4e0e\u2018\u8a00\u8bba\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u7531\u6743\u2019\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u5224\u4f8b\u5e73\u8861\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6743\u5229\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u2018\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u2019\u4e0e\u2018\u8a00\u8bba\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u7531\u6743\u2019\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u65f6\u4ee3\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u8d1f\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4eba\u9020\u6210\u6c38\u4e45\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6cd5\u5f8b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u6d32\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u2018\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u2019\u548c\u2018\u8a00\u8bba\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u7531\u6743\u2019\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u6d32\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u5224\u4f8b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6743\u5229\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u3002", "findings": "\u6b27\u6d32\u6cd5\u5f8b\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u4f53\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u9010\u6b65\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u79cd\u6743\u5229\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6743\u5229\u51b2\u7a81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u6743\u5229\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This article examines three key leadership styles: transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire, as well as the impact each has on consumerbrand interactions.This study investigates how leadership actions affect consumer perceptions, satisfaction, and loyalty. It accomplishes this by doing a literature review, which is a synthesis of prior research on digital leadership in ecommerce. According to the findings, transformational leadership, which promotes innovation, vision, and personalized customer interaction, has the most positive impact on both trust and loyalty.

In this study, we collaborated with a major Chinese electronics company and conducted a field experiment on a leading e-commerce platform to assess the performance of AI-powered advertising vis-\u00e0-vis manual advertising in two stages of online shopping, the clicking (exploration) and purchasing (decision) stages. Manual advertising targets audiences through fixed demographic filters, while AI-powered advertising dynamically mines vast behavioral and real-time data to pinpoint the most likely buyers. Our study delivers several important and interesting results. Due to leveraging more demographic and behavioral data with superior computational power, we identify a selective conversion effect that AI-powered advertising may accurately target relevant consumers who possess more knowledge of products and exercise higher product certainty, which leads to a lower likelihood of clicking on products in the clicking stage but a higher chance of purchasing products in the purchasing stage after clicking. Likewise, we identify an augmentation of the AI-algorithm-induced selective conversion effect on popular products in both stages: consumers may possess more knowledge of and familiarity with popular products than niche products, and thus, may be less likely to click on popular products of enhanced clarity in the clicking stage; in the purchasing stage, the selective conversion effect on popular products may facilitate the decision-making process and achieve higher sales. In addition, we discover that the selective conversion effect of AI-powered advertising may manifest differently for innovative products: it weakens in the clicking stage, increasing consumer clicks due to curiosity and limited information on innovative products; however, the selective conversion effect strengthens in the following purchasing stage as consumers gain a higher quality perception of innovative products after clicking and entering the product pages, contributing to enhanced product certainty and more purchases. Our study offers several critical implications for sellers to develop product-specific advertising strategies and for platforms to design and improve advertising tools to sustainably collaborate with sellers."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86AI\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5e7f\u544a\u5728\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u70b9\u51fb\u548c\u8d2d\u4e70\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u5e7f\u544a\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9ad8\u4ea7\u54c1\u8ba4\u77e5\u5ea6\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\uff0c\u5728\u70b9\u51fb\u9636\u6bb5\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u8d2d\u4e70\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u70ed\u95e8\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "AI\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5e7f\u544a\u5728\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u70b9\u51fb\u548c\u8d2d\u4e70\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5546\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "AI\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u4e0e\u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u73b0\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "findings": "AI\u5e7f\u544a\u5728\u70b9\u51fb\u9636\u6bb5\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u8d2d\u4e70\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bf9\u70ed\u95e8\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4ea7\u54c1\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5356\u5bb6\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea7\u54c1\u7279\u5b9a\u5e7f\u544a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Field experiments, on the other hand, are widely employed in social studies to examine real-world human behavior through carefully designed manipulations and treatments. However, field experiments are known to be expensive and time consuming. Therefore, an interesting question is whether and how LLMs can be utilized for field experiments. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an automated LLM-based framework to predict the outcomes of a field experiment. Applying this framework to 276 experiments about a wide range of human behaviors drawn from renowned economics literature yields a prediction accuracy of 78%. Moreover, we find that the distributions of the results are either bimodal or highly skewed. By investigating this abnormality further, we identify that field experiments related to complex social issues such as ethnicity, social norms, and ethical dilemmas can pose significant challenges to the prediction performance.

Combining detailed household expenditure surveys with environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output accounting methods, we calculate consumptionbased (i) land-use and (ii) species-loss footprints as proxies for overall biodiversity pressure. We find that the average biodiversity footprints of US households declined between 1996 and the early 2010s but began increasing again thereafter, as rising consumption pressure outpaced technological improvements. To characterize the relationship between household income and biodiversity footprints, we construct Environmental Engel Curves (EECs). Just like aggregate footprints, EECs shifted downwards until the early 2010s but have moved upwards in recent years, mainly due to a more biodiversity-intensive composition of expenditures, as we show. Moreover, EECs for land use are concave, implying a \"biodiversity-equality trade-off\" of moderate size. In 2022, full redistribution to achieve perfect income equality would have raised aggregate land use by 3.2% all else equal, calling for additional efforts to maintain a given biodiversity conservation goal."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e861996\u5e74\u81f32022\u5e74\u95f4\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u6d88\u8d39\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8db3\u8ff9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8db3\u8ff9\u5148\u964d\u540e\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u8db3\u8ff9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027-\u5e73\u7b49\u6743\u8861\u201d\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u6d88\u8d39\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8db3\u8ff9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6536\u5165\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u8db3\u8ff9\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u73af\u5883\u6069\u683c\u5c14\u66f2\u7ebf\uff08EECs\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8db3\u8ff9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5bb6\u5ead\u652f\u51fa\u8c03\u67e5\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u533a\u57df\u6295\u5165\u4ea7\u51fa\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u548c\u7269\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u8db3\u8ff9\u3002", "findings": "\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8db3\u8ff9\u5148\u964d\u540e\u5347\uff0cEECs\u663e\u793a\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u8db3\u8ff9\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6536\u5165\u518d\u5206\u914d\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51faEECs\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8db3\u8ff9\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u8861\u6536\u5165\u5e73\u7b49\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

We propose a novel framework leveraging large language models to analyze earnings call transcripts. Our method quantifies firms\u2019 GenAI exposure and classifies sentiment as opportunity, adoption, or risk. Using panel econometric techniques, we assess GenAI exposure\u2019s impact on S&P 500 firms\u2019 financial performance over 2014-2023. We find two main results. First, GenAI exposure rose sharply after ChatGPT\u2019s release, particularly in IT, Consumer Services, and Consumer Discretionary sectors, coinciding with sentiment shifts toward adoption.

Short-term expectations are extrapolative, whereas forward return expectations are contrarian. The term structure of return expectations is upward-sloping in bad times and relatively flat in good times. We also find evidence of overreaction in return expectations. We introduce perceived mispricing as a complementary belief measure and show that it helps explain the dynamics of the term structure. Perceived underpricing is negatively correlated with short-term return expectations but strongly positively correlated with forward return expectations. It is also positively related to mutual fund inflows and stated investment decisions, and emerges as a significant consideration when investors, in free-text responses, explain the drivers of their trading intentions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u671f\u8c03\u67e5\u7f8e\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u8005\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u5230\u5341\u5e74\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u4e3b\u89c2\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u3002\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u671f\u5177\u6709\u5916\u63a8\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8fdc\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u5219\u5177\u6709\u9006\u5411\u6027\u3002\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u7684\u671f\u9650\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4f4e\u8ff7\u65f6\u671f\u5448\u4e0a\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u7e41\u8363\u65f6\u671f\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e73\u5766\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u671f\u9650\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u611f\u77e5\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e0e\u77ed\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u8fdc\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e0e\u5171\u540c\u57fa\u91d1\u6d41\u5165\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u4ea4\u6613\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u4f55\u7279\u70b9\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u671f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u5e02\u573a\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u9884\u671f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5fc3\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u957f\u671f\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u56de\u7b54\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u77ed\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u5177\u6709\u5916\u63a8\u6027\uff0c\u8fdc\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u5177\u6709\u9006\u5411\u6027\uff1b\u671f\u9650\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4f4e\u8ff7\u65f6\u671f\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u7e41\u8363\u65f6\u671f\u5e73\u5766\uff1b\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5f71\u54cd\u671f\u9650\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u9884\u671f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5fc3\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6307\u6807\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3001\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5e72\u9884\u3002"}}

In meritocratic societies, this raises the question of whether individuals perceive such inequalities as fair. To address this question, we conduct experiments in the US, France, and China in which inequality between workers emerges due to random matching with buyers who require specific skills, creating inequality driven by market luck. Our findings from the US indicate that individuals are more accepting of inequalities resulting from market luck than those caused by brute luck, even though both are beyond workers' control and unrelated to their effort. The results are directionally consistent across all three countries, though with varying magnitudes of treatment effects, suggesting that redistributive preferences are sensitive to cultural differences and exposure to market institutions. We further validate our findings in survey experiments using more natural contexts and show that behavior in the experiments predicts support for real-world policies.

The analysis reveals that gold used to be an inflation hedge in the 1970s and 1980s. Gold still preserves purchasing power but vastly exceeds inflation rates and money supply. Regression analyses clearly show that CPI changes, inflation rates, inflation rate changes, money supply changes and real interest rate changes have very low or no explanatory power on gold price movements. In contrast, we find a threshold effect with strong reactions to large inflation rates and shocks and no reaction to average or \"normal\" rates. Even stronger reactions of the gold price are found for 1-year and 5-year inflation expectation shocks.

Without a deeper analysis, the financial opportunities and risks posed by a changing natural environment may not be adequately identified. One shortcoming of the empirical research so far is its failure to recognize that a firm's association with nature is highly spatially specific. Biodiversity can vary significantly across the different locations where businesses operate. Understanding how nature influences business activity also requires knowledge of the biological and physical phenomena shaping the natural world. We address these issues by leveraging two unique aspects of the New Zealand landscape: (i) the availability of granular biodiversity markers from rich sources of data and (ii) monthly sales and employment data collected by the government on businesses operating in the same location as the biodiversity markers. By matching these datasets, we can examine whether and how various science-based biodiversity markers associate with business output. We measure biodiversity based on a location's biodiversity abundance (BDA) markers. We find that businesses operating in areas with favorable BDAs-with better land use, lower population density, fewer invasive pests, and reduced drought probability-exhibit higher productivity, as measured by sales and gross profit per business unit. We also find higher output per business unit in areas with more Indigenous knowledge, another favorable BDA marker. Overall, our results align with the theory that the business productivity of a land area varies positively with its natural capital, as proxied by a higher level of biodiversity abundance."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7684\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "research_question": "\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u653f\u5e9c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u9500\u552e\u548c\u5c31\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u6709\u5229\u7684\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff08\u9500\u552e\u548c\u6bdb\u5229\uff09\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper shows that the growth in the IMF's lending capacity has failed to keep pace with financial globalization, and that this has incentivized emerging and developing economies to strengthen their domestic institutions for financial stability, particularly, their central bank's capabilities to act as a lender of last resort. We conceptualize this as influence by omission, whereby the IMF shapes behavior not through direct engagement but through its declining ability to serve as an effective financial backstop. Using original data coding central bank lender of last resort powers for 60 developing countries between 1994 and 2020, we find that countries with relatively limited access to IMF resources are significantly more likely to strengthen their central banks' lender of last resort authority. This finding is robust across a range of model specifications, instrumental variable analyses, and dynamic estimations. An event study of countries' response to the Covid shock reveals that countries with stronger lending of last resort capabilities were much more likely to manage the crisis without drawing on IMF resources. Importantly, this effect is specific to lender of last resort powers and does not extend to other aspects of central bank governance such as independence or transparency, suggesting that distinct international and domestic incentives shape different reform trajectories."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56fd\u9645\u8d27\u5e01\u57fa\u91d1\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08IMF\uff09\u8d37\u6b3e\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u957f\u672a\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0a\u91d1\u878d\u5168\u7403\u5316\u7684\u6b65\u4f10\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u5174\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u52a0\u5f3a\u56fd\u5185\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u6784\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u592e\u884c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u540e\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u9057\u6f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86IMF\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5f3a\u592e\u884c\u6700\u540e\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u6743\u529b\u3002", "research_question": "IMF\u8d37\u6b3e\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u957f\u672a\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0a\u91d1\u878d\u5168\u7403\u5316\u6b65\u4f10\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u65b0\u5174\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u52a0\u5f3a\u56fd\u5185\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u6784\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u592e\u884c\u6700\u540e\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8IMF\u8d37\u6b3e\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u95f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8IMF\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bf9\u56fd\u5185\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u5851\u9020\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u9057\u6f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u201d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5373IMF\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u95f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u56fd\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281994\u5e74\u81f32020\u5e7460\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u592e\u884c\u6700\u540e\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u6743\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u3002", "findings": "IMF\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5f3a\u592e\u884c\u6700\u540e\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u6743\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u65b0\u51a0\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u6700\u540e\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u66f4\u5c11\u4f9d\u8d56IMF\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u9057\u6f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86IMF\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5168\u7403\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u52a0\u5f3a\u56fd\u5185\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

We combine a comprehensive health insurance claim database from a Chinese city with the universe of malpractice lawsuits to study changes in physician behavior and patient outcomes. We find that physicians respond to lawsuits by practicing more conservatively, rejecting high-risk patients, reducing surgery rates, and increasing the use of diagnostic tests and traditional Chinese medicine. These changes are associated with worse patient outcomes, consistent with defensive medicine. The effects are not limited to the directly involved departments but spill over to other departments within the same hospital. In addition, the changes are short-lived, with physicians reverting to their pre-lawsuit treatment patterns in eight weeks. We provide evidence that such responses are likely driven by mental cost (including fear) and deviate from rational expectations. First, physicians in hospitals with more and less frequent lawsuits exhibit similar responses to a new lawsuit; moreover, they respond similarly to winning and losing cases. Second, physicians\u2019 reactions to a patient\u2019s death vary depending on the recency of a salient lawsuit. Lastly, physician responses are especially strong following criminal violence against physicians, which is emotionally and psychologically salient.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34115\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u533b\u751f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4e8b\u6545\u8bc9\u8bbc\u540e\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u6574\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5fc3\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff08\u5982\u6050\u60e7\uff09\u800c\u975e\u8d22\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u504f\u79bb\u7406\u6027\u9884\u671f\u3002", "research_question": "\u533b\u751f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4e8b\u6545\u8bc9\u8bbc\u540e\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u6574\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8c03\u6574\u662f\u5426\u7531\u5fc3\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u533b\u7597\u4e8b\u6545\u8bc9\u8bbc\u5bf9\u533b\u751f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u533b\u7597\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u56fd\u67d0\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u9669\u7d22\u8d54\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0e\u533b\u7597\u4e8b\u6545\u8bc9\u8bbc\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u533b\u751f\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u60a3\u8005\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u533b\u751f\u5728\u8bc9\u8bbc\u540e\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u672f\u7387\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8bca\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4e2d\u533b\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u60a3\u8005\u7ed3\u679c\u6076\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6d89\u4e8b\u79d1\u5ba4\uff0c\u8fd8\u6ce2\u53ca\u533b\u9662\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u77ed\u6682\uff08\u7ea6\u516b\u5468\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fc3\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff08\u5982\u6050\u60e7\uff09\u5bf9\u533b\u751f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u6027\u9884\u671f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u673a\u6784\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u533b\u7597\u7ea0\u7eb7\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u533b\u751f\u5fc3\u7406\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

As the globe prepares to transition away from fossil fuels, understanding the factors and parameters influencing the penetration of clean energy into existing energy markets has become a critical step. Controversies surrounding the environmental impacts of renewable technologies, variability in market structures, and economic pressures on clean energy companies can complicate this transition. Thus, resources must be focused in the right areas to ensure the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions is being met adequately. In this study, we employ a suite of machine learning models\u2014including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, AdaBoost Regression, and XGBoost Regression\u2014to analyze geographic and policy-driven parameters influencing clean energy adoption across New York State. Strategic investments in high-potential parameters, alongside targeted policy interventions and technological advancements, can maximize the impact of clean energy initiatives while ensuring long-term sustainability and economic viability. Key parameters analyzed include solar and wind potential, average energy prices, subsidy amounts, grid capacity, public awareness, renewable and fossil energy market shares, and policy support indices. Despite challenges such as market variability and infrastructure limitations, this research offers a data-driven blueprint to bridge demand-supply gaps and guide policymaking, making sure energy investments are focused in the right areas, fostering a sustainable energy future."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u5730\u7406\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u9a71\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "research_question": "\u54ea\u4e9b\u5730\u7406\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u9a71\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u5411\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\uff0c\u4f46\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u660e\u786e\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u56de\u5f52\u7b49\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u5f52\u7b49\uff09\u5206\u6790\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u7684\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "findings": "\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u548c\u98ce\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u8865\u8d34\u91d1\u989d\u3001\u7535\u7f51\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u516c\u4f17\u610f\u8bc6\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

In this context, the aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we examine whether renewable electricity retailing is a profitable strategy for firms, in the presence of what we call concerned and responsible consumers, with regard to environmental issues only. Secondly, we study whether labeling green electricity products in a more sustainable approach, considering not only the environmental but also the economic and social concerns of consumers, could enhance the greening dynamic observed in the market. Through a horizontal product differentiation model, we show that when accounting for consumers&apos; concern for the provision of public goods at the environmental level, differentiation represents the best strategy for electricity retailers at the equilibrium. Furthermore, when including the label in the analysis, the greening of the market would depend on the degree of consumers&apos; concern towards the economic and social aspects related to the purchase of a labeled green electricity product. Concerning social welfare, we show that having both firms sell green electricity would be socially optimal, and that accounting for the three dimensions of sustainable development through the label improves consumers&apos; surplus and social welfare."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u96f6\u552e\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u7535\u529b\u6807\u7b7e\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5e02\u573a\u7eff\u8272\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5e73\u4ea7\u54c1\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8003\u8651\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u65f6\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u662f\u7535\u529b\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4f1a\u56e0\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u7eff\u8272\u5316\u3002", "research_question": "1. \u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u96f6\u552e\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u7b56\u7565\uff1f2. \u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u7535\u529b\u6807\u7b7e\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5e02\u573a\u7eff\u8272\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73af\u5883\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u73af\u4fdd\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u652f\u4ed8\u610f\u613f\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7eff\u8272\u7535\u529b\u96f6\u552e\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u6027\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6c34\u5e73\u4ea7\u54c1\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6a21\u578b", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u53ca\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u662f\u7535\u529b\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4f1a\u56e0\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u5e02\u573a\u7eff\u8272\u5316\uff1b\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u73af\u5883\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5269\u4f59\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7eff\u8272\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7eff\u8272\u5316\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We evaluate both the short-term response to temperature (shocks) and the long-term equilibrium effects of climate change by matching daily, bi-monthly, monthly, yearly and long-term average temperature data to 168,585 individuals across 14,186 unique survey locales. Our results consistently reveal a statistically robust and negative association between elevated temperatures and individual deprivation which is measured as insufficient access to food, water, healthcare, and income, across both short- and long-term time horizons. However, the quantitative magnitude of these effects is very modest for short-term temperatures often statistically indistinguishable from zero. Importantly, we find that local infrastructural endowments significantly moderate temperature-related impacts, suggesting that investments in basic infrastructure can meaningfully buffer individuals from the adverse effects of both short- and long-term warming."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u975e\u6d3228\u56fd16\u5e74\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bb6\u5ead\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c14\u6e29\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0e\u8d2b\u56f0\uff08\u98df\u7269\u3001\u6c34\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u77ed\u671f\u6548\u5e94\u5fae\u5f31\u3002\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u6c14\u6e29\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u6c14\u6e29\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u975e\u6d32\u5730\u533a\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\uff1f", "motivation": "\u975e\u6d32\u662f\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u5730\u533a\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6c14\u6e29\u5bf9\u751f\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6c14\u5019\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u5339\u914d\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6c14\u6e29\u6570\u636e\u4e0e168,585\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "findings": "\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0e\u8d2b\u56f0\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u77ed\u671f\u6548\u5e94\u5fae\u5f31\uff1b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u6c14\u6e29\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6c14\u6e29\u5bf9\u751f\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u975e\u6d32\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u52a0\u5f3a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u3002"}}

We investigate the legislative voting records from four states (Alabama, Kentucky, Maryland, and Tennessee) using district-level economic and demographic data, and legislator-level information from the US Censuses for 1830 and 1850. We find that representatives from regions where large-scale slaveholding was prevalent, as well as legislators who were large slaveholders themselves, were significantly more likely to support legislation restricting manumission. These findings are consistent with a model of legislators\u2019 voting behavior that treats manumission as an effective tool to motivate labor for only some, and detrimental to the interests of other, slaveholders. By limiting manumission, these policies safeguarded the ability of large-scale slaveholders like plantation owners to rely on coercion to motivate their enslaved workers.

Recent trials in the UK have applied this intervention to individuals with low-to-moderate mental health (MH) and musculoskeletal conditions (MSK). This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of providing IPS to individuals with low to moderate MH and/or MSK conditions. To do this, we use a new open source modelling tool, the IPS cost-benefit and outcomes MODel (IPS-MOD).&nbsp;<br><br>Methods: IPS-MOD uses a Markov structure and simulates transitions between employment and non-employment states in both intervention and business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios. Incorporating data from trial evidence, national survey datasets and tax-benefit micro-simulation. Estimated outcomes are employment rates, Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), government expenditures, and net earnings over a five-year horizon. Sensitivity analyses assess the robustness of the benefit-cost ratios for different service costs and effectiveness levels.&nbsp;<br><br>Findings: The estimated benefit-cost ratio from a societal perspective for those with MSK showed that every \u00a31 spent on IPS services returned \u00a31.13 by the end of Year 1 and \u00a35.76 by the end of Year 5. The intervention is estimated to, by year 5, improve employment rates by a 5.87% relative increase and increase QALYs by 0.139 per person. This is alongside savings of \u00a31,009.92 in social security payments and \u00a3124.59 in health service resource use per person by year 5. Comparable patterns of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were observed across all health conditions. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of these results.&nbsp;<br><br>Interpretation: IPS for people with MH, MSK or MSK+MH is estimated to have a positive economic return-on-investment. Expanding IPS services to these groups, could provide substantial long-term financial and social returns. The IPS-MOD tool can be customised to different localities and is able to be used to support future policy decisions aimed at reducing work-related health disparities.

Utilizing confidential supervisory data from the European Banking Authority\u2019s EU-wide stress tests in 2021 and 2023, we employ a difference-in-differences framework to analyze how these exercises influence portfolio management decisions among European banks. This methodology allows us to compare stress-tested banks with similar non-tested institutions before and after the stress test events, isolating the effects specifically associated with the EU-wide assessments. Our findings reveal significant patterns of anticipatory behavior, with banks strategically window-dressing their capital ratios before stress tests begin. This behavior is particularly pronounced among institutions that subsequently receive the lowest scores in terms of capital depletion. We document that these anticipatory adjustments lead to decreased portfolio similarity across banks, an effect that persists after the stress tests and remains consistent across different similarity measures. Importantly, such a decrease in similarity does not spin off into more granular business model or country clusters, thus limiting potential systemic risk through portfolio synchronization. Our results, while considering how financial institutions incorporate stress test considerations into their strategic decision-making, highlight the dual role of stress tests in enhancing individual bank resilience and reducing systemic vulnerabilities.

Surprisingly, this approach appears to yield a successful out-of-sample stock market index timing strategy even when trained in rolling windows as small as T = 12 months with P in the thousands. However, when P &gt;&gt; T , the RFF-based forecast becomes a weighted average of the T training sample returns, with weights determined by the similarity between the predictor vectors in the training data and the current predictor vector. In short training windows, similarity primarily reflects temporal proximity, so the forecast reduces to a recency-weighted average of the T return observations in the training data-essentially a momentum strategy. Moreover, because similarity declines with predictor volatility, the result is a volatility-timed momentum strategy. The strong performance of the RFF-based strategy thus stems not from its ability to extract predictive signals from the training data, but from the fact that a volatility-timed momentum strategy happened to perform well in historical data. This point becomes clear when applying the same method to artificial data in which returns exhibit reversals rather than momentum: the RFF approach still constructs the same volatility-timed momentum strategy, which then performs poorly."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff08RFF\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u6307\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "research_question": "\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff08RFF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u6307\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RFF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff08RFF\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6eda\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u8bad\u7ec3RFF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "findings": "RFF\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RFF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u9192\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5728\u4f7f\u7528RFF\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5224\u3002"}}

This chapter discusses the market-failure rationale for regulatory contract law, positioning it within the broader architecture of public law. Our analysis identifies when and how regulatory intervention can enhance welfare and preserve the integrity of contractual dealings. This framework offers an efficiency-based economic justification for regulatory contract law grounded on the correction of market failures."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u540c\u6cd5\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u5931\u7075\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u5e02\u573a\u5931\u7075\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u798f\u5229\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u5408\u540c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u540c\u6cd5\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u5e02\u573a\u5931\u7075\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u798f\u5229\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u5408\u540c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8303\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u79c1\u4eba\u5408\u540c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6216\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5e02\u573a\u5931\u7075\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u540c\u6cd5\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e02\u573a\u5931\u7075\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "findings": "\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u540c\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u5e02\u573a\u5931\u7075\uff08\u5982\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u798f\u5229\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u5408\u540c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u540c\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e72\u9884\u5408\u540c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In the first experiment, providing teachers with a cue about strong research evidence increased their likelihood of recommending a math learning app by 0.24 SD (compared to a no-cue control), while a peer-popularity cue raised it by 0.21 SD; using both cues together led to a 0.30 SD increase.

Nearly 1,100 households living in apartment buildings in downtown Amsterdam were assigned to either a neoclassical treatment using extrinsic incentives or one of two behavioral treatments aimed at fostering intrinsic motivation or reciprocity. The extrinsic and reciprocity-based interventions both led to immediate but short-lived improvements, primarily via intensification of sorting by households already engaged in the activity. In contrast, the intrinsic motivation treatment generated equally strong but more persistent effects and was particularly effective at encouraging non-sorting households to start sorting.

We introduce a third-party informer into the moral wiggle-room game. Almost half of the dictators tried to avoid information only to have it imposed upon them by the informer. These unwillingly-informed dictators frequently revised their behavior to benefit the recipient, even at their own expense. Given an opportunity to reward informers, most dictators chose to do so, but those who had bad news thrust upon them by the informer were more likely to withhold the reward.

We develop a game-theoretic model to examine the economic impact of generative AI, focusing on its influence on human creators' strategic decisions regarding content differentiation and pricing. We find that AI-generated content is sustainable only when both generative AI's quality and creative capabilities are not too low. As these capabilities improve, AI-generated content increasingly captures demand for human-created content, prompting human creators to differentiate themselves to mitigate competition. However, overall content diversity increases only when generative AI's creative capability is high enough. Our analysis further reveals that generative AI's quality and creative capabilities exert opposing effects on human creators' profitability: higher creativity enhances differentiation and reduces price competition, while higher quality increases substitutability between AI and human-generated content and intensifies competition. When generative AI exhibits high creativity but low quality, human creators may benefit from its presence due to improved consumer targeting and reduced competition. Finally, our results show that, although AI-generated content can expand content variety, improve consumer matching, and lower human creators' creative costs through intensified competition, it enhances overall social welfare and consumer surplus only when its quality is sufficiently high. These findings offer practical guidance for platform designers and policymakers on how to balance AI deployment with incentives for human creativity in content ecosystems."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u901a\u8fc7\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u91cd\u5851\u521b\u610f\u4ea7\u4e1a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4ec5\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u521b\u610f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4f4e\u65f6\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4f1a\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u3002AI\u7684\u9ad8\u521b\u610f\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u7ade\u4e89\u3002AI\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "research_question": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51b3\u7b56\u53ca\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5bf9\u521b\u610f\u4ea7\u4e1a\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0a\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u521b\u610f\u80fd\u529b\u9002\u4e2d\u65f6\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\uff1b\u9ad8\u521b\u610f\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a0\u5267\u7ade\u4e89\uff1b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfAI\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u521b\u610f\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u76f8\u53cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u8861AI\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u6fc0\u52b1\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Students often encounter challenges such as long queues, delays in form processing, the unavailability of key staff members, repeated visits to administrative offices, and the loss of important documents. These issues frequently result in delayed graduation and disrupted participation in national service or further academic pursuits. To address these shortcomings, this project proposes the development of an Online Student Clearance System designed to streamline and automate the clearance process. The system aims to eliminate the inefficiencies inherent in manual procedures by providing a reliable, accessible, and efficient digital platform. It enables students to initiate and complete their clearance remotely, reducing the need for physical presence and administrative overhead. The system is developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and implemented with HTML for the user interface and Visual Studio as the integrated development environment, with a local database server for data management. This web-based solution is intended to significantly improve the speed, accuracy, and convenience of the clearance process for both students and administrative staff."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u751f\u79bb\u6821\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u79bb\u6821\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u548c\u8017\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528MVC\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u6821\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u751f\u79bb\u6821\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u79bb\u6821\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\u548c\u8017\u65f6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6bd5\u4e1a\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eModel-View-Controller (MVC)\u67b6\u6784\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528HTML\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Visual Studio\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "findings": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u79bb\u6821\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79bb\u6821\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MVC\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u79bb\u6821\u6d41\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u884c\u653f\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

The quantification of industrial policy instruments leverages data from financial reports of listed firms and the land registry. The equivalent fiscal cost of industrial policy through cash subsidies, tax benefits, subsidized credit, and subsidized land for favored sectors (including both private and state-owned firms) is estimated at about 4 percent of GDP per year, with a growing share of tax benefits over time. Next, the paper uses a structural model to estimate the relationship between industrial policies and factor misallocation for a broad sample of firms. Various industrial policy instruments are found to affect factor allocations in different ways\u2014subsidies tend to lead to excess production, while trade and regulatory barriers limit production. Overall, factor misallocation from industrial policies is estimated to reduce domestic aggregate TFP by about 1.2 percent.

This descriptive study analyzes tradable and nontradable sectoral trends, with our findings demonstrating that the share of tradable sector employment and, within it, manufacturing employment, leveled off in the decade following the GFC after declining for several decades. Still, by 2023, the nontradable sector accounted for a large majority of employment and real value added. At the same time, the tradable sector exhibited robust productivity growth of nearly 3 percent, juxtaposed against far lower 0.7 percent growth in nontradable sectors.

In this paper, we argue that QE should be evaluated mainly on its ability to achieve core macro-objectives as well for its effects on the consolidated fiscal position of the government and central bank, although central bank losses can matter to the extent that they may weaken central bank credibility. Using a DSGE model with segmented asset markets, we show how QE can provide a sizeable boost to output and inflation in a deep liquidity trap and can reduce public debt substantially. This contrasts to the rise in public debt that occurs under fiscal expansion and makes QE an attractive tool in a high debt environment.  There is more reason for caution in using QE in a \u201cshallow\" liquidity trap in which the notional interest rate is only slightly negative: QE runs more risk of causing the economy to overheat, especially if forward guidance has a strong element of commitment, and is more likely to generate sizeable central bank losses. Some refinements in strategy, including the use of escape clauses, can help mitigate overheating risks."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u5bbd\u677e\uff08QE\uff09\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6838\u5fc3\u5b8f\u89c2\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u592e\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8d22\u653f\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u592e\u884c\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u5176\u4fe1\u8a89\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DSGE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eQE\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u632f\u4ea7\u51fa\u548c\u901a\u80c0\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d45\u5ea6\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fc7\u70ed\u548c\u592e\u884c\u635f\u5931\u3002", "research_question": "\u91cf\u5316\u5bbd\u677e\uff08QE\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6838\u5fc3\u5b8f\u89c2\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u53ca\u592e\u884c\u4fe1\u8a89\uff1f", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u5bbd\u677e\u88ab\u6279\u8bc4\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u901a\u80c0\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u592e\u884c\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eDSGE\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u5272\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DSGE\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790QE\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "QE\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u632f\u4ea7\u51fa\u548c\u901a\u80c0\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d45\u5ea6\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fc7\u70ed\u548c\u592e\u884c\u635f\u5931\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86QE\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6548\u679c\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u6d45\u5ea6\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528QE\u65f6\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\uff08\u5982\u9000\u51fa\u6761\u6b3e\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}
