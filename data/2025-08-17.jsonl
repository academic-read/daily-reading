While AI-driven intrusion detection offers improved accuracy, its sustainability in resource-constrained medical settings remains a critical concern. To address this, we formalize healthcare cybersecurity as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, balancing detection accuracy with energy and resource efficiency. This study introduces a novel AI-augmented green cybersecurity framework designed specifically for healthcare information systems, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). The proposed framework incorporates lightweight AI models—Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and a Shallow Autoencoder—to enable effective threat detection with minimal energy consumption. Experiments were conducted on benchmark cybersecurity datasets (NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017), simulating realistic intrusion scenarios. Models were evaluated using traditional metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC) and green computing proxies (model size, inference time, CPU and memory usage). Results show that LightGBM provides the most favorable trade-off between detection performance and energy efficiency, while Logistic Regression is suitable for deployment on low-resource edge devices. The Shallow Autoencoder demonstrated potential for unsupervised anomaly detection but requires refinement for complex attacks. Overall, this study offers a practical and theoretically grounded architecture for green AI cybersecurity in healthcare, promoting resilience, energy efficiency, and ethical digital health transformation in line with global development goals."}}

This paper examines whether firms respond to rising EPU by transforming their business models toward e-commerce. Using high-frequency data from 83,193 firm-product-month observations of Chinese A-share listed firms, we find that EPU significantly accelerates firm e-commerce. A one-standard-deviation increase in EPU corresponds to 14.3% higher e-commerce sales and 7.6% higher sales volume. These positive effects persist under alternative uncertainty measures, IV specifications using U.S. EPU, and controls for COVID-19 and major promotional events. Further, mechanism tests reveal that e-commerce helps firms navigate high EPU by improving liquidity and enabling asset-light operations, as well as reducing transaction costs to boost profitability. Our findings suggest that e-commerce serves not merely as a distribution channel but as a strategic growth option, allowing firms to transform uncertainty into opportunity. This reorientation toward digital business models offers broader implications for firm adaptation in volatile policy environments."}}

A total of 381 South African consumers participated in an online survey, which was structured around the UTAUT2 model and extended to include perceived risk and trust. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to validate the measurement model, followed by a structural equation model to assess the significance of the factors and their relationship with the dependent variable, behavioural intention. The findings demonstrate that consumers have significantly changed their online shopping behaviour, increasing their use of online shopping during the pandemic, with plans to continue this trend. All nine variables explored in the study were significant to varying degrees, with effort expectancy, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit showing the strongest correlations. While this research offers an overall view of eCommerce behaviour in South Africa during the lockdown, further studies could consider moderating variables such as age and gender. Additionally, the use of stratified random sampling in future research could provide a more generalised view of consumer behaviour."}}
