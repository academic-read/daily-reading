It is also being used more and more for planning tourist trips. Since artificial intelligence is still under development, research has been conducted to determine which available artificial intelligence is the most reliable for planning individual travel. To conduct this research, a case study was undertaken, focusing on planning a personalized trip to New York City from Belgrade. A comprehensive analysis of various AI-driven travel planners was conducted, considering both standalone AI applications and web-based platforms. These tools were assessed based on several key criteria: Planner Design: The user-friendliness, intuitiveness, and overall design of the interface; Chat Communication: The ability to interact with the AI through natural language processing, enabling real-time queries and personalized recommendations; Pre-Trip Itinerary Planning: The AI\u2019s capacity to generate detailed itineraries, including suggested activities, attractions, and transportation options; Enriched Travel Experiences: The integration of multimedia content, such as videos and photos, to enhance the overall travel experience; Location Information and Time Estimates: The provision of comprehensive information about destinations, including descriptions, opening hours, and estimated visit durations; Transfer and Transportation Planning: The AI\u2019s ability to suggest optimal transportation modes and routes between different locations; Meal Planning: Recommendations for dining options, including local cuisine, budget-friendly choices, and dietary preferences; Cost Planning: Estimated budgets for accommodation, transportation, food, and activities, helping travelers plan their expenses effectively; Language Support: The availability of AI in Serbian and other languages to cater to a diverse user base. By comparing the performance of these AI-powered travel planners, the study aims to identify the most reliable and user-friendly tools for individual travelers. While leading AI systems demonstrate high reliability in generating detailed itineraries and timetables, there are still areas for improvement, particularly in terms of accurate cost estimations. Inconsistent pricing information can lead to user distrust and the need for additional verification. This research contributes to a better understanding of the current state of AI-powered travel planning tools and provides insights for future developmenst and refinement of these technologies.\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cdAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212AI\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "research_question": "\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u7528\u7684AI\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\uff0c\u54ea\u79cd\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5728\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u3001\u884c\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cdAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "findings": "\u9886\u5148\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u884c\u7a0b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4f30\u7b97\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAI\u5728\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65c5\u884c\u8005\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6539\u8fdbAI\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This study aims to evaluate visitor awareness and motivations for halal travel in Bangladesh, measure halal-compliant facilities, understand sector barriers, and examine cultural, religious, and economic impacts. The goal is to suggest strategies for establishing Bangladesh as a leading halal travel destination and fostering stakeholder cooperation. The growth of halal tourism in Bangladesh is hindered by a lack of study on consumer perceptions, influencing factors, opportunities, and the inclusion of informal migrants, necessitating extensive scholarly investigation. Using qualitative methods, including interviews and focus groups, this study addresses these gaps and finds key insights into market demand and opportunities. Despite safety concerns and negative perceptions being the main obstacles, the sector shows promise, especially among youth who perceive halal tourism as secure and culturally resonant. Challenges include integrating cultural standards and ensuring effective certification methods. With Bangladesh's growing Muslim population, there are major growth prospects for halal tourism.

This study introduces a <i>re-humanizing</i> approach to AI-assisted decision-making by framing algorithmic collaboration through the lens of structural embeddedness, where AI is not simply a tool for optimization, but a socially situated actor in decision ecosystems. We propose <i>Empathic Algorithm Collaboration</i> (EAC) as a mechanism to restore individualized, ethically grounded consideration in human-AI decision environments. Drawing on theories of social empathy and person-situation interactionism, EAC consists of two key components \u2013 Interpersonal Perspective-Taking (IPT) and Contextual Understanding (CU) \u2013 which guide human evaluators to engage more reflectively with AI recommendations. Through a field experiment in a micro-lending context, we examine the impact of EAC on deliberative intensity and decision quality. Results show that EAC not only fosters more conscientious deliberation but also improves decision accuracy. Furthermore, differences in evaluator responses across borrower conditions suggest that person-situation interactionism plays a critical role in shaping the cognitive and ethical engagement of decision-makers. These findings highlight the potential of EAC to support human-centered, context-sensitive decision augmentation and contribute to a broader understanding of how AI can be aligned with social values in structurally embedded domains of socially consequential decision-making.<a rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u91cd\u65b0\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u201d\u7684AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u5171\u60c5\u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u4f5c\u201d\uff08EAC\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u9645\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eEAC\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\uff1f", "motivation": "AI\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u793e\u4f1a\u5171\u60c5\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4eba\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u4e92\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8d37\u6b3e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5EAC\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "EAC\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u53cd\u5e94\u56e0\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u60c5\u5883\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EAC\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Industrial metaverses represent the next evolution of cyber-physical systems (CPS), integrating physical assets with their digital twins (DTs) for enhanced monitoring, simulation, and control. However, ensuring the integrity and security of critical digital assets within these environments remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a private BC architecture based on Hyperledger Fabric, specifically designed to authenticate and manage digital assets in real time.The proposed framework features three layers: (1) a private BC network for secure transaction handling, (2) an API bridging layer enabling cross-platform integration, and (3) a Unity-based industrial metaverse application for user interaction. Through smart contracts (Chaincode), the framework manages digital asset creation, modification, deletion, and authentication, ensuring tamper-proof records and robust traceability. Performance evaluation using Hyperledger Caliper demonstrates the system&apos;s high throughput (up to 2500 TPS for read operations) and low latency (<0.03s) with no upfront costs, significantly outperforming public blockchain alternatives in performance and cost.A case study involving a physical production workshop validates the framework\u2019s feasibility. The results show that the framework can securely manage and authenticate all digital assets within an industrial metaverse. Compared to public BCs, the proposed private BC approach eliminates transaction fees and supports real-time digital asset management and authentication.

This study presents an investigation into the instant effects versus slope effects of gamified lotteries on pay-as-you-wish (PAYW) gifting and audience engagement in the entertaining livestreaming industry. Employing a quasi-experimental design, the research utilizes an interrupted time series analysis with a reversed treatment design (ITS-RTD) to capitalize on an unexpected suspension and subsequent reintroduction of the lottery function on a leading livestreaming platform in China. Our findings reveal that the implementation of gamified lottery correlates with a short-term increase of 14% in host income and a 10% rise in audience engagement. However, based on the hedonic adaptation theory, our findings also highlight the double-edged nature of lotteries, indicating the risks of over-reliance on gamified elements that can lead to a hedonic adaptation trap. The impacting mechanisms incorporate perspectives from traffic transference and hedonic adaptation, offering insights into the nuanced impact of gamified lotteries while suggesting a balanced approach for hosts to leverage gamification alongside other engagement strategies to mitigate the risks of over-dependence.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f4\u64ad\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u62bd\u5956\u5bf9\u89c2\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u6536\u5165\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u77ed\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4eab\u4e50\u9002\u5e94\u9677\u9631\u3002", "research_question": "\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u62bd\u5956\u5bf9\u76f4\u64ad\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u89c2\u4f17\u6253\u8d4f\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u659c\u7387\u6548\u5e94\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u76f4\u64ad\u5e73\u53f0\u7ade\u4e89\u6fc0\u70c8\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u62bd\u5956\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u503c\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4eab\u4e50\u9002\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6d41\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\uff08ITS-RTD\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u62bd\u5956\u529f\u80fd\u6682\u505c\u4e0e\u91cd\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u62bd\u5956\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u4f7f\u4e3b\u64ad\u6536\u5165\u589e\u52a014%\uff0c\u89c2\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710%\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4eab\u4e50\u9002\u5e94\u9677\u9631\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u62bd\u5956\u7684\u53cc\u5203\u5251\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4eab\u4e50\u9002\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u4e3b\u64ad\u5e73\u8861\u4f7f\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u62bd\u5956\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

One of the most powerful tools available for such an analysis is the browser&apos;s integrated developer tools (DevTools), which provide deep visibility into the client-side code execution. However, sophisticated malicious websites often employ anti-debugging techniques to detect the presence of such tools and alter their behavior to appear benign. Prior research into such polymorphic sites has focused mainly on isolated client-side detection vectors, those that operate independently within the browser without requiring any coordination from the server. In this work, we argue that collusive vectors, which involve explicit communication between the client and an attacker-controlled server, are common, highly effective, and stealthy. These collusive client-attacker techniques evade detection by minimizing observable client-side artifacts, making them particularly challenging to analyze. Furthermore, despite the growing prevalence of such tactics, the security community still lacks a comprehensive framework to counter these anti-debugging tactics effectively.In this paper, we examine the prevalence of isolated and collusive anti-debugging vectors and then develop a solution that enables stealthy analysis of websites. First, we introduce a novel class of anti-debugging techniques in which adversaries exploit debugger-related resource requests, such as those for source maps or debugging symbols, initiated by the browser to detect DevTools. This mechanism allows attackers to detect the presence of active debuggers with a minimal client-side footprint. Through a large-scale analysis of the top 100,000 websites and their subpages, we find that approximately 1 in 17 websites employing severe anti-debugging measures leverage such collusive vectors to identify and obstruct DevTools-based analysis. Second, to defend against these threats, we present StealthDev, a policy-driven debugging framework built on a modified Chromium browser. StealthDev is specifically designed to remain stealthy and resilient against isolated and collusive anti-debugging techniques, including those relying on timing side channels.

However, the growing capacities of UAVs have introduced significant cybersecurity challenges that threaten their operational integrity and reliability, preventing them from reaching the potential that technological progress has made possible. Through a systematic mapping review this study identifies and analyses these challenges, highlighting critical vulnerabilities associated with communication systems, data integrity, physical and remote threats, software weaknesses, and regulatory compliance gaps. Developing a resilience framework grounded in the principles of redundancy, flexibility, modularity, diversity, and tightness of feedback loops, the study offers insights into countering these vulnerabilities and enhancing the capacity of UAVs to withstand unforeseen disturbances. The findings demonstrate the urgency of developing a robust cyber-resilience framework that integrates advanced security measures, standardised regulations, and collaborative efforts among stakeholders to address both current and emerging threats.

This paper investigates the infrastructure economics of sparse MoE architectures in cloud-native environments, with a focus on benchmarking their cost, performance, and accuracy across major platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. It presents a comparative analysis of leading MoE models including Switch Transformer, GLaM, DeepSpeed-MoE, and Mixtral-8x7B, highlighting their ability to achieve state-of-the-art results at a fraction of the resource consumption.

However, achieving high accuracy and stability requires extensive data collection from densely distributed reference points (RPs), which can be resource-intensive. Interpolation is a common technique that helps increase the number of RPs without incurring excessive costs. Nonetheless, generating the locations for interpolated points, i.e., virtual reference points (VRPs), can be a big challenge since it might affect the positioning results. This paper proposes a novel method that uses a hybrid clustering algorithm combined with a center-connected interpolation approach (CCIPOS) to automatically and efficiently generate VRPs, adapting to irregular RP distribution. First, the method uses the two-phase clustering algorithm including the k-means algorithm and Voronoi diagram to group the RPs in the fingerprinting database (DB) with similar characteristics to the same cluster. Then, VRP locations within each cluster are estimated using a proposed center-connected algorithm. To fulfill the WiFi data at each VRP, Inverse Distance Weighting, a simple but effective interpolation method, is applied. From the experimental results based on the public datasets, it is demonstrated that the CCIPOS method effectively generates more VRPs into the original fingerprinting DB but reduces much time for finding the user\u2019s position. To be specific, CCIPOS increases the total number of RPs in the DB by about seven times on average, increases the positioning accuracy by up to 6%, and decreases the computation time by nearly 90%. This study illustrates the feasibility of enhancing the WiFi fingerprint DB, particularly in large and complex environments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fde\u63a5\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CCIPOS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff08VRPs\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8WiFi\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728WiFi\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff08VRPs\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff1f", "motivation": "WiFi\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff08RPs\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u63d2\u503c\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0RPs\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8ek-means\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cVoronoi\u56fe\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fde\u63a5\u63d2\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08CCIPOS\uff09\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528k-means\u548cVoronoi\u56fe\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684RPs\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b2. \u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210VRPs\uff1b3. \u5e94\u7528\u9006\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a0\u6743\u6cd5\u586b\u5145VRPs\u7684WiFi\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "CCIPOS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684RPs\u6570\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u589e\u52a07\u500d\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad86%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd190%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3aWiFi\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u62df\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684WiFi\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002"}}

Employing deep learning technologies and econometric analysis shows that the fit between photos and text has an inverted U-shape effect on tourists' rating using online hotel review data from Qunar.com. The dispersion of rating and the number of reviews can weaken above effect due to the varying amount of cognitive resources possessed by tourists.

Using data from Italian firms and detailed climate data, it uncovers a sizable negative effect of extreme temperatures on firm-level productivity and revenue-based marginal product of capital. Based on these estimates, the model generates aggregate productivity losses from local temperature fluctuations that are higher than previously thought, ranging from 0.60 to 6.82 percent depending on the scenario and the extent of adaptation. Notably, these losses are approximately four times greater than those estimated by averaging firm-level losses in a representative firm model, which does not capture frictions that alter allocative efficiency in a heterogeneous firm setting.

However, this paper proposes a novel Dynamic Scharr-Gaussian Learning with Skeletal Topology Awareness Network (DSLSTA), which enhances the model\u2019s ability to perceive target structures and edges through multi-stage feature interaction and adaptive filtering. First, we design a Skeleton Extraction Network to generate precise skeleton labels that represent the core topological structure of the targets. Second, we propose a Stage-Adaptive Dual-Filter Module (SADFM) that utilizes Scharr and Gaussian filters to dynamically smooth target regions based on variance estimation while preserving sharp edge details. This approach effectively suppresses background noise and improves the accuracy of the boundary. Furthermore, we construct a Cross-Stage Skeleton-Driven Interaction Module (CSSDIM) to progressively integrate skeleton information into multi-scale semantic features, allowing the network to perceive internal target structures and enhance global consistency. Extensive experiments on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSLSTA outperforms 13 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving average improvements of 4.05%, 3.32%, 11.14% and 23.81% in S\u03b1, E\u03d5, F\u03b2 \u03c9 and M, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of skeleton guidance and adaptive filtering mechanisms\u00a0 in complex camouflage scenarios.

We examine the relationship between such violence and settlement characteristics in the context of the 1905 Russian Revolution, which triggered numerous anti-Jewish pogroms. Counter to an extensive literature that emphasizes the contribution to conflict of ethno-religious polarization, we show that the sharp increase in pogroms after October 1905, when publication of the October Manifesto and accompanying anti-Semitic propaganda increased feelings of political threat among many non-Jews, was smaller in settlements with relatively large Jewish populations.

Despite high vaccination rates in Saudi Arabia, regional variations in vaccine confidence persist. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of vaccine hesitancy among parents in Madinah using the validated Parent Attitudes About Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 322 parents in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. Vaccine hesitancy was assessed using the Arabic version of the PACV (score \u226550 indicating hesitancy). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated model discrimination (AUC = 0.561, 95% CI). Logistic regression identified predictors of hesitancy while adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Results: The study revealed a high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy (73.9%, 238/322 parents). Significant occupational disparities were observed: healthcare workers exhibited markedly lower hesitancy (15.5%, 11/71) compared to non-healthcare parents (70.9%, 178/251; \u03c7\u00b2 = 5.302, p = 0.021). Logistic regression identified healthcare occupation as the sole significant predictor of reduced hesitancy (OR = 0.16, 95% CI 0.07-0.36, p &lt; 0.001). No significant associations were found between hesitancy and age, gender, education level, marital status, or income (p &gt; 0.05 for all). The model demonstrated good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow \u03c7\u00b2 = 7.816, p = 0.045) but moderate discrimination (AUC = 0.561), suggesting additional unmeasured factors influence hesitancy. Conclusion: Vaccine hesitancy is highly prevalent among parents in Madinah, with healthcare workers demonstrating significantly greater vaccine confidence. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions that focus on non-healthcare parents while leveraging healthcare professionals as trusted advocates. Future research should explore specific reasons for hesitancy to inform culturally tailored public health strategies in this region."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u9ea6\u5730\u90a3\u5730\u533a\u7236\u6bcd\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u72b9\u8c6b\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u75ab\u82d7\u72b9\u8c6b\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe73.9%\uff0c\u533b\u7597\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u975e\u533b\u7597\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u3002", "research_question": "\u9ea6\u5730\u90a3\u5730\u533a\u7236\u6bcd\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u72b9\u8c6b\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5730\u533a\u95f4\u75ab\u82d7\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7684PACV\u91cf\u8868\u8bc4\u4f30\u75ab\u82d7\u72b9\u8c6b\u3002", "method": "\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u7814\u7a76\uff0c322\u540d\u7236\u6bcd\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "findings": "\u75ab\u82d7\u72b9\u8c6b\u738773.9%\uff0c\u533b\u7597\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u975e\u533b\u7597\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\uff0815.5% vs 70.9%\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PACV\u91cf\u8868\u5728\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u533b\u7597\u7236\u6bcd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u533b\u7597\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u5021\u5bfc\u8005\u3002"}}

Innovative ideas can flourish in psychologically secure surroundings created by leaders who promote experimentation, empower staff, and encourage open communication. Furthermore, the function of resource allocation, strategic decision-making, and exterior participation to promote innovation is analyzed. per the study's results leadership is in addition to overseeing an operation; it's also about fostering an environment that supports inventiveness and eventually produces long-term success for startups."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u521b\u65b0\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5192\u9669\u7cbe\u795e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d8\u9769\u578b\u9886\u5bfc\u5728\u57f9\u517b\u521b\u65b0\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521b\u9020\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u521b\u9020\u529b\u5bf9\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u5728\u521b\u9020\u652f\u6301\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u5173\u952e\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u53d8\u9769\u578b\u9886\u5bfc\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u6216\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u521b\u65b0\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5192\u9669\u7cbe\u795e\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d8\u9769\u578b\u9886\u5bfc\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u4e0e\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u521b\u65b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5982\u8425\u9020\u5fc3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u3001\u9f13\u52b1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6c9f\u901a\u3002"}}

With the rise of online video platforms, the audiovisual format has made its way as a dynamic and engaging format that allows for the creation of narratives to counter distorted information. This circumstance is particularly noticeable in the healthcare sector, where most of the recent fact-checking activity is taking place.&nbsp; \n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Methodology: Through the analysis of the official YouTube channels of the health departments of all Spanish autonomous communities from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023, this paper explores the use of audiovisual factchecking by Spanish regional governments, and it describes the nature of these videos and the strategies undertaken on that platform to tackle disinformation.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Results: Despite the expected territorial disparities, the research findings show that an increasing number of Spanish regional health authorities are using YouTube to fight disinformation. They also show that the videos posted on that platform provide a strong response to fake news, either as a preventive measure or in response to existing publications. Discussion: In the current landscape of declining mass media, where audience dispersion leads a to (sometimes deliberate) fragmentation of discourse, we are confronted with the paradox of being a society with access to a vast amount of information, but not well-informed. Therefore, it is essential to have strong institutions that verify fake content through\n</div>\n<div>\n popular formats.\n</div>\n<div>\n <span><br></span>\n</div>\n<div>\n <span><b>Spanish Abstract:</b> Introducci\u00f3n: A trav\u00e9s de sus redes sociales, las instituciones p\u00fablicas abordan las noticias falsas y enfrentan la desinformaci\u00f3n que afecta tanto a ellas como al p\u00fablico general. Con el auge de las plataformas de video en l\u00ednea, el formato audiovisual se ha consolidado como un formato din\u00e1mico y atractivo que permite la creaci\u00f3n de narrativas para contrarrestar la informaci\u00f3n distorsionada.

Using a general equilibrium assignment model with hierarchical firms and monopolistic competition, I show that firm concentration can increase even as productivity dispersion remains stable or declines-driven instead by organizational flattening and rising skill dispersion. Calibrated to U.S. data from the 1980s and 2010s, the model replicates the rise in both earnings and firm size inequality and matches several untargeted distributional features. Counterfactual decompositions reveal that changes in firm structure - not widening productivity gaps - account for most of the observed increase in employment concentration.

The framework explicitly balances community engagement, sustainability, service reliability, and cost, addressing the complex trade-offs inherent in urban governance. Key modifications to MOEA/D include adaptive weight vector adjustment, Differential Evolution (DE) operators for enhanced exploration, gradient-based local search for fine policy refinement, and dynamic environment adaptation to respond to evolving city dynamics. Extensive simulations in a realistic smart city environment demonstrate superior convergence speed, robustness under uncertainty, and improved Pareto front quality compared to baseline methods such as GA-PPO and PSO-SAC.

These factors have become all the more important in light of the recent banking crisis in the United States. The lessons learnt from the recent banking crisis have heightened the need for financial regulators and bank supervisors to undertake continuous search for the non-traditional determinants of financial stability to identify risks early and mitigate risks to financial system stability. In this article, we examine some non-traditional determinants of financial stability using data from sixty-one countries from 2009 to 2021. The first-difference panel GMM regression method was used to estimate the model, and we find that greater financial stability in the previous period is followed by greater financial stability in the subsequent period in all regions, signalling the persistence of financial stability. The loan-to-deposit ratio improves financial stability in European and Americas countries while countries that have a high level of financial inclusion, and whose banking sector have a high loan-to-deposit ratio, are more financially stable. Financial inclusion improves financial stability in high inflation environments particularly in African and Americas countries. High levels of financial inclusion impair financial stability during a recession particularly in Asian countries. African banks with a high loan-to-deposit ratio are more financially stable during a recession. Also, Americas and African countries that have a combined high financial inclusion and inflation rates and whose banking sector have a high loan-to-deposit ratio are less financially stable, indicating that high inflation hinders financial inclusion and loan-to-deposit ratio from improving financial stability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u8d37\u5b58\u6bd4\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u7f8e\u56fd\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u5371\u673a\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u8d37\u5b58\u6bd4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282009-2021\u5e7461\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u5dee\u5206\u9762\u677fGMM\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff1b\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u8d37\u5b58\u6bd4\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u9ad8\u901a\u80c0\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u8d37\u5b58\u6bd4\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u901a\u80c0\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u548c\u94f6\u884c\u76d1\u7ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Spatial woundedness carries within it many implications for how that pain is rendered. This is most visible in forms of cultural production that have settled the hurt exacted into a place of innovation. It is a full mutuality between architecture and the destruction that has violently defaced it so much so that a new image of urbanity begins to emerge. Beyond the agony felt by the capital, intellectualizing the spatial wound that has manifested and been given life as it were suggests a pressing need to comprehend this phenomenology. Historicizing and then theorizing what is a poetics of destruction assists in coming to comprehend not simply the features of an urban character necessarily born out of ruin but doing so against an orientalist narrative that seeks to entrench the Baghdadi space in perpetual liminality.

While clinical trial transparency aims to address this issue, increased public scrutiny may make managers more risk-averse, potentially stifling novel R&amp;D initiatives. This raises the question: Does transparency hinder technologically novel R&amp;D?&nbsp; <br><br>Methodology/Results: Using data from nearly 10,000 clinical trials from 2000 to 2014, we examine how a 2005 policy to increase transparency affects drug novelty. Using a continuous difference-in-differences approach, we find that transparency prompts firms to rely more on previously-used technologies (i.e., exploitative R&amp;D) without reducing their pursuit of never-before-tested technologies (i.e., exploratory R&amp;D). We identify negative informational spillovers as a mechanism: technology failures that are now more visible because of transparency could erode confidence in related trials, prompting firms towards familiar technologies to avoid reputational damage. Consistent with this mechanism, the impact of transparency is strongest among firms with less-diversified portfolios that are the most exposed to negative informational spillovers.&nbsp;<br><br>Managerial implications: Our primary theoretical contribution is in demonstrating the unintended negative impact of transparency on novelty.

However, the final decision-making authority for forest management lies with the landowner, and policies promoting resource management must also consider the characteristics of forest conditions under each ownership type. In this study, we used National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to determine the current structures of Japanese cedar plantations in terms of productivity and biodiversity, as well as differences among ownership types. The stand structure indices for productivity and biodiversity were calculated; cluster analysis identified four distinct forest stand types: high-mixed, low-mixed, managed, and dense plantation forests (PF). Notable relationships emerged between ownership and stand types. Forest stratification, the number of standing dead trees, and number of nonplanted trees differed significantly among the stand types. Furthermore, national forests had considerably more high-mixed PF (characterized by high species diversity and a mix of planted and nonplanted trees), indicating the efforts of successful diversification. Community forests exhibited more well-managed PFs, signifying effective management resulting from communal efforts and economies of scale. Individually owned forests were predominantly dense PFs, often reflecting under-managed conditions with high tree density, potentially owing to factors such as aging owners and low timber prices. On-site environmental factors could have less influence on stand structure than long-term forest management practices.

Delivery companies and merchants can introduce some innovative solutions such as the equipment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to decrease their operating costs, environmental impact, and social risks during the delivery process. This paper mainly develops a mathematical model to get the best allocation of AVs among city logistics centers (CLCs) as a mixed delivery method. The advantage of the presented model stems from considering the equipment cost, the delivery cost, and the CO2 emission, which is measured through social carbon cost (SCC). In addition, this paper establishes a risk model considering the impact of seasonal variations to evaluate the infection risk of delivery during pandemic periods for four potential delivery scenarios: customers going to CLCs, ordering online and picking-up at CLCs, delivering by traditional vehicles (TVs), and delivering by the mixed method with the optimal allocation of AVs. The research finds the optimal allocation for a London case, reveals the relationship between the nominal service capacity (NCpa) of CLCs and the optimal number of CLCs equipped with AVs, concludes that the more CLCs are equipped with AVs, the fewer CO2 emissions and the fewer citizens will be infected, and provides some managerial insights that may help delivery companies and merchants make appropriate decisions about the allocation of AVs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08CLCs\uff09\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u6210\u672c\u3001\u914d\u9001\u6210\u672c\u548cCO2\u6392\u653e\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u78b3\u6210\u672c\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u914d\u9001\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAVs\u7684\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11CO2\u6392\u653e\u548c\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ba1\u7406\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u914d\u9001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u9001\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u78b3\u6210\u672c\uff08SCC\uff09\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316AVs\u5728CLCs\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u914d\u9001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAVs\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11CO2\u6392\u653e\u548c\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14CLCs\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0eAVs\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u78b3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u914d\u9001\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u5546\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eAVs\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Data analysis was performed using Smart PLS 4.0 software, and data testing was carried out through descriptive and verifiable analysis methods. The hypothesis was tested using the T-test and F-test. The findings indicate that work-life balance, work stress, and burnout substantially influence leadership style, which in turn affects employee performance.

As automation technologies gain traction, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) assist human pickers by handling transport tasks and optimizing workflows. However, due to high cost levels and infrastructural constraints, AGVs are often introduced incrementally, resulting in mixed-technology scenarios where workers with a prior technology generation and workers with the new (AGV) technology generation operate side by side, for example in the same warehouse aisle. One challenge in such settings is picker blocking, which occurs when the actions of one picker impede or delay the movements of another picker. This study empirically examines pick column blocking and within-aisle blocking regarding their impact on task performance time. Using a mixed-effects regression model, we analyze 490,398 pick events from a German retailer during 2023. Our results show that both types of blocking significantly increase task performance time. However, AGV assistance mitigates these negative effects. Our results demonstrate that AGVs go beyond transport assistance by reducing congestion and ensuring smoother, more efficient movement. The study provides valuable insights into the theory and management to optimize warehouse operations and contributes to the growing research on human-AGV collaboration in logistics."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\u4ed3\u5e93\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u62e3\u8d27\u5458\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5bfc\u5f15\u8f66\uff08AGV\uff09\u534f\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u62e3\u8d27\u963b\u585e\uff08picker blocking\uff09\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cAGV\u8f85\u52a9\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u963b\u585e\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\u4ed3\u5e93\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u62e3\u8d27\u963b\u585e\uff08picker blocking\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff1fAGV\u8f85\u52a9\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u62e3\u8d27\u662f\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u73af\u8282\uff0cAGV\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u867d\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u62e3\u8d27\u963b\u585e\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ed3\u5e93\u8fd0\u8425\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u62e3\u8d27\u963b\u585e\u5bf9\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u67902023\u5e74\u5fb7\u56fd\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u7684490,398\u4e2a\u62e3\u8d27\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u62e3\u8d27\u963b\u585e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5217\u963b\u585e\u548c\u901a\u9053\u5185\u963b\u585e\uff09\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46AGV\u8f85\u52a9\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AGV\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u62e3\u8d27\u963b\u585e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301AGV\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, many existing models tend to be highly complex, making them difficult for industrial managers to adopt practically. This article introduces a decision-support model that reprograms already scheduled maintenance activities, based on predefined plans, to lower the number and duration of planned downtimes. The approach uses integer linear programming and incorporates key operational parameters such as resource availability, task duration, and maintenance frequency. The model employs an opportunistic grouping strategy to identify compatible tasks during scheduled shutdowns, maximizing resource use and cutting down on interruptions. To ensure real-world applicability, the model is implemented using a user-friendly software tool with an interactive interface, allowing maintenance professionals to use it without advanced technical skills. An application in an electricity distribution company showed the model\u2019s effectiveness. Results revealed a 44.4% reduction in scheduled shutdowns and a 25.5% decrease in total downtime. Even with the addition of corrective maintenance events, the rescheduling maintained significant improvements. This work enhances the literature by introducing a post-planning rescheduling stage that optimizes existing maintenance plans through intelligent grouping, respecting constraints, and increasing management flexibility. Besides technical gains, the model offers economic advantages by lowering resource mobilization costs and extending equipment availability. Its design aligns with digital systems, supporting the transition toward Maintenance 4.0, and encouraging more efficient, adaptive, and sustainable industrial maintenance practices."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u5df2\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u505c\u673a\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u7ef4\u62a4\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ef4\u62a4\u8c03\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u9891\u7387\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "findings": "\u5728\u7535\u529b\u5206\u9500\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u5212\u505c\u673a\u51cf\u5c1144.4%\uff0c\u603b\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1125.5%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540e\u89c4\u5212\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u7ec4\u4f18\u5316\u7ef4\u62a4\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ef4\u62a44.0\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

We examine how these challenges manifest in the initiative to develop a voluntary product stewardship scheme for bedding in Australia. The study is based on a research collaboration with the Australian Bedding Stewardship Council (ABSC), interviews and site visits with 15 of its member organisations, followed by an interactive online workshop called \u2018Beds of the Future\u2019. We first examine how motivations for participating in the ABSC\u2019s product stewardship initiative differ among the different types of organisations in the bedding supply chain, from manufacturers to retailers to waste managers and materials recyclers. Informed by scholarship on business ecosystems, diverse economies and sustainability transitions, we pose questions about the trajectories of change that supply chain actors are currently engaged with and the valuing practices that support them. We then examine the potential for synergies between these trajectories to generate system-level change and the agency of key organisations required to achieve this, focusing in particular on design-led and waste management-led trajectories. The case of the bedding stewardship initiative in Australia demonstrates both strengths and limitations of the product focus for progressing circular economy concepts. It highlights the need for orchestration by both manufacturers and government agencies to coordinate change trajectories informed by circuits of value, and the significance of diversity among organisation types and their valuing practices."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5e8a\u4e0a\u7528\u54c1\u81ea\u613f\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53c2\u4e0e\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u540c\u53d8\u9769\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5e8a\u4e0a\u7528\u54c1\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53c2\u4e0e\u81ea\u613f\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u9769\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e8a\u4e0a\u7528\u54c1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u5bf9\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u534f\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u53d8\u9769\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u591a\u5143\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6c\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4e0e\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5e8a\u4e0a\u7528\u54c1\u7ba1\u7406\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bbf\u8c0815\u5bb6\u6210\u5458\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3001\u5b9e\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\u53ca\u4e92\u52a8\u5728\u7ebf\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u3002", "findings": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5236\u9020\u5546\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u673a\u6784\u5728\u534f\u8c03\u53d8\u9769\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u534f\u540c\u548c\u53d8\u9769\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5e8a\u4e0a\u7528\u54c1\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Our findings indicate that bank business models and credit policies are adversely influenced by natural resource wealth.

We argue that limited bank intermediation in these countries serves as a protective measure against the additional risks posed by natural resource rents. Credit rationing helps banks mitigate credit risks, which are particularly pronounced in resource-based economies.

By employing GD, parts are optimized for material efficiency, structural performance, longevity, and reduced waste, aligning with circular economy principles. This study conducts a quantitative comparison of cost and environmental impacts between conventional manufacturing (CM) and generatively designed additive manufacturing (GDAM) in the context of aviation industry centralized spare part inventory pooling. We estimate the total annual and lifecycle cost of each scenario using a developed cost model integrating the inventory models. Our sensitivity analysis reveals that on an equal part longevity, GDAM becomes cost-competitive beyond ~84% part weight reduction. While GDAM part being 53% lighter than CM part, a 50% increase in the part longevity yields cost savings of up to 24.6%, demonstrating that durability is a more influential driver than lightweighting in aerospace industry. Furthermore, GDAM offers substantial sustainability advantages, including significant reductions in fuel consumption cost, material waste, and CO2 emissions. These environmental benefits become increasingly evident under high weight-reduction scenarios. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating GDAM into spare part supply chain (SPSC) cost analysis.

Using a sample of 1,275 Eurozone corporate bonds issued between 2015:Q1 and 2018:Q4, we estimate a two-stage empirical model to evaluate. In the first stage, we find that the initial association between CSPP eligibility and lower spreads disappears once firm- and bond-level characteristics are controlled for, suggesting that observed differences reflect issuer and instrument features rather than programme eligibility. While the CSPP\u2019s effect does not vary systematically by firm or bond characteristics, the results indicate broader market effects, likely driven by the programme\u2019s signaling power and perceived credibility, which extended beyond the impact of direct bond purchases. In the second stage, we assess changes in leverage following the issuance of bonds. CSPP eligibility did not seem to affect the debt ratio in the issuance year. However, longer-maturity eligible bonds are associated with delayed increases in leverage, as firms expanded their debt ratios in the year following issuance. This pattern suggests that improved financing conditions under the programme may have encouraged firms to raise additional debt at a later stage."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u592e\u884c\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u95e8\u8d2d\u4e70\u8ba1\u5212\uff08CSPP\uff09\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u503a\u5238\u53d1\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u5229\u5dee\uff08\u4ee5\u671f\u6743\u8c03\u6574\u5229\u5deeOAS\u8861\u91cf\uff09\u53ca\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u4ee5\u503a\u52a1\u6bd4\u7387\u540c\u6bd4\u53d8\u5316\u8861\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cCSPP\u8d44\u683c\u5bf9\u5229\u5dee\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u88ab\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ca\u503a\u5238\u7279\u5f81\u6240\u63a9\u76d6\uff0c\u4f46\u5e02\u573a\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u503a\u5238\u8d44\u683c\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6760\u6746\u589e\u52a0\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "research_question": "\u6b27\u6d32\u592e\u884c\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u95e8\u8d2d\u4e70\u8ba1\u5212\uff08CSPP\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u503a\u5238\u53d1\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u5229\u5dee\u53ca\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8CSPP\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u878d\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5e02\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d44\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u67902015-2018\u5e74\u95f41275\u53ea\u6b27\u5143\u533a\u4f01\u4e1a\u503a\u5238\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "1.

These differences categorize them into distinct subsectors with unique risk profiles. This study applies the novel methodology proposed by Engle and Campos-Martins (2023) to analyse the common volatility (COVOL) across cryptocurrency subsectors, including Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Smart Contract platforms. Using a sample of the largest 17 cryptocurrencies from March 2016 to April 2024, our findings reveal distinct volatility patterns within these subsectors, driven by macroeconomic factors such as the term spread and interest rates.

Building on a panel of annual ratings from Moody\u2019s, S&P, and Fitch for over 104 countries between 1996 and 2022, we augment a macro\u2011fiscal model with contemporaneous and time\u2011averaged measures of bank efficiency, profitability, capitalization and liquidity. Adopting a fully Bayesian framework with a LASSO shrinkage prior, we estimate a linear panel model via three sampling algorithms: the Bayesian Gibbs Slice Sampler (BGSS), its QR decomposition (QR\u2011BGSS), and the No\u2011U\u2011Turn Sampler (NUTS). Our findings reveal that sustained improvements in bank efficiency and robust capital buffers significantly elevate sovereign ratings over the long term, while short\u2011run banking shocks receive comparatively little weight. We also document some heterogeneity across agencies. Profitability\u2019s unexpected long\u2011run negative association with ratings suggests that persistently high returns may mask risk\u2011taking behaviours detrimental to sovereign creditworthiness. Finally, and from a methodological viewpoint, we find that BGSS and QR\u2011BGSS deliver virtually identical posterior inferences to NUTS at a fraction of the computational cost, highlighting their potential for scalable, real\u2011time credit\u2010risk applications"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u6743\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u94f6\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u7f13\u51b2\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u8bc4\u7ea7\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u77ed\u671f\u94f6\u884c\u51b2\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "research_question": "\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u6743\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6743\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8f\u89c2\u8d22\u653f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u94f6\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u5316\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u548cLASSO\u6536\u7f29\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BGSS\u3001QR-BGSS\u548cNUTS\u4e09\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u957f\u671f\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u7f13\u51b2\u589e\u52a0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e3b\u6743\u8bc4\u7ea7\uff1b\u77ed\u671f\u94f6\u884c\u51b2\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6743\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u6743\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86BGSS\u548cQR-BGSS\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Deep tunnel sewer systems (DTSS) have been developed as a primary infrastructural response to mitigate flood risks; however, empirical evidence of their actual effectiveness remains limited. This study evaluates the flood mitigation effect of South Korea\u2019s first operational DTSS, located in Yangcheon District in Seoul. Using district-level panel data on flood damage and rainfall from 2010 to 2023, we apply Difference-in-Differences and Synthetic Difference-in-Differences methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the DTSS in reducing flood damage. The results consistently showed that the DTSS substantially reduced monetarily quantified flood damage, with estimated reductions ranging from 97.6% to 99.2% across the specifications and methods. These findings provide empirical support for the cost-effectiveness of large-scale flood infrastructure investments, offering real-world validation that moves beyond simulation-based assessments."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u97e9\u56fd\u9996\u5c14\u9633\u5ddd\u533a\u6df1\u96a7\u6392\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DTSS\uff09\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6d2a\u6c34\u635f\u5bb3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6d2a\u6c34\u635f\u5bb3\u3002", "research_question": "\u6df1\u96a7\u6392\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DTSS\uff09\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u57ce\u5e02\u6d2a\u6c34\u635f\u5bb3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u6d2a\u6c34\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8eDTSS\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u6d2a\u6c34\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282010-2023\u5e74\u533a\u7ea7\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u548c\u5408\u6210\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30DTSS\u6548\u679c\u3002", "findings": "DTSS\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6d2a\u6c34\u635f\u5bb3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e45\u5ea6\u572897.6%\u81f399.2%\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9632\u6d2a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u9632\u6d2a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

The bacterium, identified as Cytobacillus firmus (previously classified under Bacillus) using 16S rRNA sequence, is Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and endospore-forming. It was successfully isolated from the pneumatophores of A. marina found along the eco-tourism trail in Bauang, La Union, Philippines. Identification was meticulously performed through a combination of traditional morphological assessment and advanced molecular analysis, confirming its classification. These findings contribute to the understanding of microbial diversity within Philippine mangrove ecosystems by detailing the presence and precise identification of this endophyte.

Despite great efforts, massive segments of the Indian population, particularly in rural and village areas, remain unaware of the importance of environmental protection. This lack of information has led to exploitation of natural resources, unsustainable practices, and environmental degradation. This paper highlights the critical position of people's participation in promoting ecological awareness and sustainable practices across India, with particular awareness of rural areas where the connection between communities and nature is deeply intertwined.&nbsp; <br><br>India's rural population, which constitutes nearly 65% of the total, is closely dependent on natural sources of livelihood. However, Ignorance of sustainability has resulted in indiscriminate extraction of groundwater, deforestation, and poor waste control. According to the National Green Tribunal, more than 70% of the rural water in our bodies is polluted due to inadequate waste management, while deforestation continues to push upwards. These issues highlight the urgent need for tailored environmental education in rural areas.&nbsp;<br><br>This paper examines the success of local fads such as Village Forest Committees under the Joint Forest Management Program, which expanded forest cover by 30%, and national campaigns, along with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and Jal Shakti Abhiyan, which mobilized one thousands upon thousands for sustainable practices. Programs like the National Green Corps, bringing together more than 200,000 schools, show the potential of teaching a younger era about conservation.<br><br>Persistent barriers, including socio-financial inequality, illiteracy, and limited access to records, impede progress. Integrating environmental education into higher education curricula, involving panchayats and self-service corporations, and leveraging digital systems are critical to empowering rural groups.&nbsp;<br><br>This observation implies that well-informed citizens, supported through local initiatives and authority rules, are essential for sustainable development.

The measure strongly correlates with established inflation indicators, such as the Consumer Price Index and Cleveland Fed estimates. We investigate the drivers of heterogeneity in these expectations, including sector, CEO age, geographical location, and labor market tightness. Our findings reveal that firms with older CEOs, located in regions with tight labor markets, were more likely to expect inflation to be persistent post-pandemic. Furthermore, firms expecting transitory inflation significantly reduced short-term borrowing and inventory, while firms with persistent inflation expectations increase capital expenditures. These results highlight the economic implications of heterogeneous inflation expectations, while providing a novel approach to measuring disaggregated inflation expectations."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u4ee3\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6682\u65f6\u6027\u6216\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u80c0\u6307\u6807\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u9884\u671f\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u4ee3\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u9884\u671f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u901a\u80c0\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u9884\u671f\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u9884\u671f\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u80c0\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982CPI\u548c\u514b\u5229\u592b\u5170\u8054\u50a8\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u9884\u671f\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "findings": "\u4f01\u4e1aCEO\u5e74\u9f84\u8f83\u5927\u3001\u4f4d\u4e8e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7d27\u5f20\u5730\u533a\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u901a\u80c0\u662f\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\uff1b\u9884\u671f\u6682\u65f6\u6027\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u51cf\u5c11\u77ed\u671f\u501f\u8d37\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u671f\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u589e\u52a0\u8d44\u672c\u652f\u51fa\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Emphasis is placed on the problems that have arisen during the implementation and the author's analysis of the current state is made, which is considered as part of the general state of the country and the European Union. Examples are given to support the author's theses, as well as those that serve to support the conclusions and conclusions. The circular economy is examined in both planes as a revolutionary model or a model that exists and is being upgraded. The main emphasis is placed on the approaches and relevant sectors in which the principles of the circular economy can and are successfully applied. The development is supported by a project survey and statistical data from Eurostat.

I compare areas directly affected by the new transit line to adjacent control areas, focusing on changes in public transit usage, labor market outcomes, and indicators of gentrification. Results suggest a substantial increase in public transit usage and a significant decline in unemployment rates in treated areas relative to controls. Additionally, monthly rents rose significantly, accompanied by a modest increase in the share of college-educated residents, suggesting early signs of gentrification. Effects are estimated relative to a 2013-2015 pre-treatment baseline, and pre-trend validity is confirmed through a placebo regression using only pre-treatment years.

This article employs both a panel threshold model and a random forest model, analyzing data from the primary administrative regions in the United States and China to explore the threshold effects and regional heterogeneity of bioenergy technology on carbon intensity. In the United States, the impact of bioenergy technology on carbon intensity initially shows a positive effect, which later turns negative as per capita capital stock increases. The technology's inhibitory effect strengthens with higher levels of education but becomes insignificant as the Gini coefficient rises. In China, increasing per capita capital stock shifts the impact of bioenergy technology from negative to insignificant, while higher education levels enhance its inhibitory effect. The Gini coefficient, however, does not significantly affect the technology's impact. Additionally, these threshold effects exhibit notable regional variations.

This paper estimates the effect of the Minneapolis 2040 Plan on home values and rental prices. Using a synthetic control approach we find that the reform lowered housing cost growth in the five years following implementation: home prices were 16% to 34% lower, while rents were 17.5% to 34% lower relative to a counterfactual Minneapolis constructed from similar metro areas. Placebo tests document these housing cost trajectories were the lowest of 83 donor cities (p=0.012). The results remain consistent and robust to a series of subset analyses and controls. We explore the possible mechanism of these impacts and find that the reform did not trigger a construction boom or an immediate increase in the housing supply. Instead, the observed price reductions appear to stem from a softening of housing demand, likely driven by altered expectations about the housing market."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u660e\u5c3c\u963f\u6ce2\u5229\u65af2040\u8ba1\u5212\u901a\u8fc7\u53d6\u6d88\u5355\u6237\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u79df\u91d1\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u5e02\u573a\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u671f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002", "research_question": "\u660e\u5c3c\u963f\u6ce2\u5229\u65af2040\u8ba1\u5212\u5bf9\u4f4f\u623f\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u79df\u91d1\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d6\u6d88\u5355\u6237\u5206\u533a\u5bf9\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u4f4f\u623f\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u6027\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u4f9b\u9700\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u653f\u7b56\u5b9e\u65bd\u524d\u540e\u660e\u5c3c\u963f\u6ce2\u5229\u65af\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u79df\u91d1\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u653f\u7b56\u5b9e\u65bd\u540e\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\uff0c\u623f\u4ef7\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8616%\u81f334%\uff0c\u79df\u91d1\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8617.5%\u81f334%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u671f\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u52a0\u4f9b\u7ed9\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u57ce\u5e02\u63d0\u4f9b\u53d6\u6d88\u5355\u6237\u5206\u533a\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6539\u5584\u4f4f\u623f\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u6027\u3002"}}

The system of environmental federalism in India, whereby central and state governments cooperate to preserve the environment, is examined in this paper. It looks at how the Indian Constitution divides the several duties for environmental protection and what laws and court rulings have done to mold this intricate but cooperative system. The study reveals some important prospects, for example the ability for distributed decision-making that fits the very varied local ecosystems of the nation. However, it also highlights some major issues, such as the regular overlaps of jurisdiction that can impede what should be seamless paths for decisive action and the necessary clear fiscal picture for any effective federal effort. This paper adds to the current debate on Indian federalism"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u8054\u90a6\u4e3b\u4e49\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5baa\u6cd5\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\u804c\u8d23\u7684\u5212\u5206\u4ee5\u53ca\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u6cd5\u9662\u5224\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u8fd9\u4e00\u590d\u6742\u4f46\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u7ba1\u8f96\u6743\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u8d22\u653f\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u5370\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u8054\u90a6\u4e3b\u4e49\u4f53\u7cfb\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u592e\u548c\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6311\u6218\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u5cfb\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5370\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u8054\u90a6\u4e3b\u4e49\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u73af\u5883\u8054\u90a6\u4e3b\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5baa\u6cd5\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6cd5\u9662\u5224\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6cd5\u9662\u5224\u51b3\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "findings": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u7ba1\u8f96\u6743\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u8d22\u653f\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u884c\u52a8\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u8054\u90a6\u4e3b\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u8054\u90a6\u5236\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

In the context of high investment risks, technology immaturity, and policy fragmentation, the research seeks to inform the design of a financing architecture that aligns with India's National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) and broader climate finance goals. This research employs a qualitative, desk-based methodology using secondary data sources. It analyzes global best practices, national policy frameworks, and institutional arrangements to develop a typology of risk-sharing instruments. A comparative matrix is used to evaluate applicability by project scale, while thematic coding informs a tiered de-risking framework suitable for Indian hydrogen ecosystems.<br><br>The study identifies 12 risk-sharing instruments\u2014including blended finance, PPPs, viability gap funding (VGF), sovereign guarantees, and results-based finance (RBF)\u2014and categorizes them by their applicability to different hydrogen project typologies. It demonstrates that large-scale projects benefit from capital-intensive, sovereign-backed instruments, whereas small-scale and MSME-led applications require grant-based and performance-linked tools. Institutional coherence and policy predictability emerge as critical enablers for financial mobilization. This is the first study to offer a comparative typology of risk-sharing mechanisms tailored to India\u2019s hydrogen sector, emphasizing scale-differentiated financial design. It proposes a four-tier de-risking architecture aligned with investor risk appetites, project characteristics, and implementation capacities. The research bridges the gap between climate finance theory and operational investment frameworks for green hydrogen in emerging markets. The findings can inform policymakers, DFIs, and private investors in structuring blended finance vehicles, PPP models, and credit enhancement schemes. It provides actionable insights for agencies such as MNRE, SECI, NIIF, and SIDBI to anchor de-risking strategies and align India\u2019s green hydrogen finance ecosystem with global climate goals and Article 6 mechanisms.&nbsp;"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7eff\u8272\u6c22\u9879\u76ee\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9002\u5408\u7684\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u611f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u62c5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a8\u5458\u79c1\u4eba\u8d44\u672c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8612\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u62c5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u9879\u76ee\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u5c42\u53bb\u98ce\u9669\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9002\u5408\u5370\u5ea6\u7eff\u8272\u6c22\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u62c5\u6a21\u578b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u3001\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6563\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u56fd\u5bb6\u7eff\u8272\u6c22\u4efb\u52a1\uff08NGHM\uff09\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u878d\u8d44\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u62c5\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u878d\u8d44\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u53bb\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u684c\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u624b\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u62c5\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u3002", "findings": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8612\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u62c5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6c22\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5927\u578b\u9879\u76ee\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u4e3b\u6743\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u9879\u76ee\u9002\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d60\u6b3e\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u6c22\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u62c5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u548c\u79c1\u4eba\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u878d\u8d44\u5de5\u5177\u3001PPP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

The study analyzes how population aging affects the monetary policy environment and explores appropriate policy responses. As of the end of 2024, Korea has become a \u201csuper-aged\u201d society with over 20% of the population aged 65 or older, and it is projected to have the highest elderly population share among OECD countries by 2045.<br><br>II. Aging is found to induce structural shifts in the monetary policy environment\u2014namely, slower growth, lower real interest rates, and weaker soundness of financial institutions\u2014which can narrow monetary policy space and exacerbate trade-offs between policy objectives when the foundations of growth and financial stability weaken simultaneously. The sectoral breakdown of these structural shifts is as follows:<br><br>\u2022 Slower growth and lower real rates: An open-economy life-cycle model for Korea shows that aging reduces labor supply, thereby lowering potential growth, and through reduced investment and increased savings, exerts downward pressure on equilibrium real interest rates. For example, if fertility and life expectancy had remained at 1991 levels (1.71 births per woman; life expectancy 72.2 years), the equilibrium real rate in 2024 would have been approximately 1.4 percentage points higher. Scenario analyses incorporating future demographic projections likewise indicate persistent downward pressure on both growth and real rates.<br><br>\u2022 Modest disinflationary pressure: Panel data analyses across OECD countries, combined with simulations for Korea, suggest that aging is projected to exert downward pressure on inflation of about a 0.15 percentage point per year from 2025 to 2070. However, offsetting upward pressures\u2014such as deglobalization, supply-chain restructuring, and climate change\u2014imply significant uncertainty about the long-term inflation trajectory.<br><br>\u2022 Weakened financial stability foundations: An analysis of panel data covering 7,148 banks over 27 years in OECD countries shows that aging tends to reduce banks\u2019 capital ratios and increase default risk, driven by declining profits and subsequent pursuit of higher-risk, higher-return activities. Institutions with lending structures heavily concentrated in real estate exhibit larger negative impacts.<br><br>III. Structural shifts due to aging should be addressed through structural reforms in the real and financial sectors rather than short-term measures. Should the low growth trend persist, calls for accommodative monetary policy may intensify. However, low growth driven by structural factors cannot be effectively addressed by short-term, demand-side policies and such measures may entail side effects including financial imbalances. Therefore, a sustainable solution should be sought through structural reforms aimed at strengthening the fundamentals of the real and financial sectors.<br><br>IV. Specifically, structural reforms in the real and financial sectors should proceed as follows: To offset the decline in labor supply caused by aging, policies should expand female labor force participation and support continued employment among older workers. At the same time, improving youth employment, housing, and childcare conditions is necessary to encourage fertility recovery. To boost total factor productivity, policymakers should promote technological innovation and enhance the efficiency of resource allocation across the economy. Given that real estate\u2013focused lenders are more vulnerable to aging effects, the current reliance on lending-based real estate financing needs to be gradually reduced. Additionally, in light of the financial market\u2019s sensitivity to external price variables, the base of the demand for the Korean won must be broadened, and foreign exchange markets should be deepened to enhance stability and resilience.<br><br>V. These structural reforms are expected to raise real interest rates and potential growth, thereby expanding monetary policy space and reinforcing the foundations of financial stability. Scenario analyses indicate that, if three structural reforms are implemented\u2014a gradual recovery in fertility to the OECD average, expanded employment among older cohorts, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in TFP growth\u2014both real interest rates and potential growth will be approximately 1 percentage point higher on average during 2025\u20132070, compared to a no- reform baseline. Higher real rates would widen policy space and alleviate structural constraints on monetary policy; stronger growth would bolster borrowers\u2019 profitability and soundness, strengthening the foundation of financial stability.<br><br>VI. In addition, efforts to enhance monetary policy effectiveness under the changed conditions should be pursued. These include continued refinement of the environment for open market operations to better reflect aging-induced changes in the policy environment; improved policy communication to more effectively manage market expectations; the use of an integrated policy framework that combines multiple instruments to achieve policy objectives; and, in particular, stronger coordination between monetary policy and macroprudential measures to improve overall policy effectiveness."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u653e\u7f13\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u5229\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f29\u5c0f\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u52a0\u5267\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6539\u9769\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e94\u91c7\u53d6\u54ea\u4e9b\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u97e9\u56fd\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u201c\u8d85\u9ad8\u9f84\u201d\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u52302045\u5e74\u5c06\u6210\u4e3aOECD\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e2d\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u53e3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u5229\u7387\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ea7\u751f\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5f00\u653e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u60c5\u666f\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u3001OECD\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u5229\u7387\u3001\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u653e\u7f13\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u5229\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u901a\u80c0\u538b\u529b\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u5e76\u524a\u5f31\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6539\u9769\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8001\u5e74\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u8981\u7d20\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bf9\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6539\u9769\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5982\u63d0\u9ad8\u5973\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u3001\u652f\u6301\u8001\u5e74\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u91d1\u878d\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Despite its global pilgrimage appeal, the urban environment of Vrindavan is under severe stress due to unmanaged religious tourism, unregulated commercial expansion, and fragmented civic infrastructure. Core precincts like the Banke Bihari Temple zone, Loi Market, Yamuna Ghats, and the 21-kilometer Parikrama Marg experience extreme congestion, sanitation challenges, and environmental degradation, especially during peak festivals. The absence of a coordinated urban planning mechanism has resulted in piecemeal interventions, compromising both spiritual sanctity and urban functionality. This study proposes a Comprehensive Pilgrimage Corridor that integrates sacred geography, pedestrian connectivity, heritage preservation, and ecological restoration within a unified governance framework. Anchored around the Banke Bihari precinct and extending to Nidhivan, Keshi Ghat, Rangji Temple, and other religious-spiritual landmarks, the project seeks to transform Vrindavan into a model of sustainable pilgrimage urbanism. Key features include the creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for coordinated implementation, rehabilitation zones for affected vendors and residents, smart mobility interventions, and financial models combining state, central, and private funding mechanisms. Drawing on successful case studies like the Kashi Vishwanath and Mahakal corridors, this initiative presents Vrindavan as a replicable model of spiritual urban renewal. It emphasizes inclusive stakeholder participation, heritage-sensitive design, and long-term ecological and economic sustainability.

Herein, In2O3@ZnIn2S4 (In2O3@ZIS) artificial Z-scheme heterostructures were synthesized via a facile in-situ epitaxial growth method. Thermodynamic and kinetic investigation of the charge transfer studies revealed that the In2O3@ZIS Z-scheme heterostructure significantly enhanced the photoelectrode&apos;s photo-generated electron-hole separation efficiency and light-harvesting capability. The optimized photoelectrode achieved a remarkable photocurrent density of 39.33 \u03bcA/cm\u00b2, marking an 86.60-fold enhancement over pristine ZIS (0.454 \u03bcA/cm\u00b2). Leveraging this platform, a portable PEC detection system was self-constructed for the ultrasensitive detection of ascorbic acid (AA). The sensor demonstrated a linear response ranging from 10-7 M to 10-2 M with a low detection limit (LOD) of 29.9 nM. Furthermore, an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was employed to train 152 experimental data and generated a predictive regression model for AA. This model exhibited high accuracy (R\u00b2 = 0.9984) and low prediction error (<10%) for the prediction of AA. This work provides a promising approach for high-accuracy, intelligent, and portable detection of AA."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eIn2O3@ZnIn2S4 Z\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5149\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u7535\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u6297\u574f\u8840\u9178\u7684\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7In2O3@ZnIn2S4 Z\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u5149\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6297\u574f\u8840\u9178\u7684\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5149\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u4fbf\u643a\u6027\u800c\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5149\u7535\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "Z\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5149\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u539f\u7406\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u4f4d\u5916\u5ef6\u751f\u957f\u6cd5\u5408\u6210In2O3@ZnIn2S4 Z\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u5149\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "In2O3@ZnIn2S4\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u7535\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5149\u7535\u6d41\u5bc6\u5ea6\u63d0\u534786.60\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u574f\u8840\u9178\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a10-7 M\u81f310-2 M\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9650\u4f4e\u81f329.9 nM\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08R\u00b2=0.9984\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Z\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5149\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u6297\u574f\u8840\u9178\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This study assessed its impact on children aged 6\u201323 months in 315 priority districts using multivariate logistic regression and Propensity Score Matching (PSM). Results showed that children exposed to the programme had 25% lower odds of wasting, 13% lower odds of being underweight, and 24% lower odds of anaemia, though no significant effect was observed on stunting. PSM estimates confirmed a significant average treatment effect on the treated for these outcomes.

Focusing on both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets, we propose a novel methodology that integrates machine learning for stock selection with price-based signals for portfolio timing. Our findings reveal that, across both markets, stock selection driven by machine learning methods demonstrates strong return predictability, whereas timing signals show limited efficacy, particularly when accounting for trading costs. We conclude that the marginal contribution of timing within a machine learning-based stock selection framework is relatively constrained, a pattern that is consistent across both the U.S. and Chinese markets.

I leverage the introduction of a policy in Chile that aimed to raise teacher quality by crowding-in higher performing students into Education programs, while crowding-out the lower-performing ones. Exploiting the sharp assignment rule I estimate that, at the threshold, enrollment of high performing students at teacher colleges increased by 42%, with low-income students coming disproportionately from non-enrollment. The policy generated a positive composition effect of 0.25SD in test scores, which lead to an increase in 0.11SD in Teacher Value Added and 0.12SD in Teaching Skills. I develop a general equilibrium model of the higher education market. In doing so, I present a novel method for solving discrete-continuous games in large markets. Counterfactual simulations show that alternative policies can improve the distribution of students that enroll in Education programs. The distribution of college quality limits the impact on Teacher Value Added, while Targeting the policy to low-income students can yield further gains at no additional cost."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6559\u5e08\u62db\u8058\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u667a\u5229\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u5f15\u9ad8\u5206\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u5165\u6559\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u5e76\u6392\u9664\u4f4e\u5206\u5b66\u751f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u5e08\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5165\u5b66\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6559\u5e08\u62db\u8058\u8d28\u91cf\uff1f", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u5438\u5f15\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u5165\u6559\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u5e08\u961f\u4f0d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563-\u8fde\u7eed\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u667a\u5229\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5206\u914d\u89c4\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "findings": "\u653f\u7b56\u4f7f\u9ad8\u5206\u5b66\u751f\u5165\u5b66\u7387\u589e\u52a042%\uff0c\u6559\u5e08\u4ef7\u503c\u589e\u52a00.11SD\uff0c\u6559\u5b66\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u53470.12SD\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563-\u8fde\u7eed\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u5305\u62ec\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We focus on the consequences of personalist rule, where power is concentrated in an individual or small elite. Extending the dynamic panel strategy of Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2019), we estimate the differential growth performance of democracies, institutionalized autocracies, and personalist autocracies. Across eight GDP series, eight autocracy codings, and six measures of personalism, we observe a consistent pattern: Whenever an \u201cautocratic penalty\u201d emerges, it is concentrated in personalist regimes. The growth performance of institutionalized dictatorships, in contrast, is statistically indistinguishable from that of democracies.

This study, based on user online charging reviews, constructs a charging service improvement prioritization model that integrates text mining, dual importance analysis and demand classification. Firstly, natural language processing and fine-grained sentiment analysis methods are integrated to systematically deconstruct service attributes in review texts and quantify their sentiment orientation values. Then, we design a neural network-Kano joint model, revealing the nonlinear driving effects of service attribute sentiment orientations on user satisfaction through a Backpropagation Neural Network incorporating an attention mechanism, simultaneously combining an improved Kano model for service demand classification, and ultimately generating a three-dimensional Sentiment-Driver-Kano (SD-Kano) decision matrix that integrates dual importance of service attributes (emotional expression intensity, satisfaction driving effects) and Kano types. Finally, an experiments demonstrates that this model can precisely identify the positioning and user perception characteristics of different service attributes, and proposes several targeted service attribute improvement priorities and resource allocation strategies. The research outcomes provide charging service operators with a scientifically rigorous and operationally practical decision-support tool for implementing differentiated resource allocation and service efficiency enhancement."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7528\u6237\u5728\u7ebf\u5145\u7535\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5145\u7535\u670d\u52a1\u6539\u8fdb\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u5728\u7ebf\u5145\u7535\u8bc4\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5145\u7535\u670d\u52a1\u6539\u8fdb\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5145\u7535\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u5236\u7ea6\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u6539\u8fdb\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc-Kano\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u53caSD-Kano\u51b3\u7b56\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc-Kano\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u670d\u52a1\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51faSD-Kano\u51b3\u7b56\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u6539\u8fdb\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

First, the SMTDNR problem is established, incorporating distributed renewable generators, fuel generators, energy storage systems, and controllable loads, simplified through circular constraint linearization, Jabr relaxation, and second-order cone (SOC) relaxation techniques. Then, a one-stage multi-timescale successive branch reduction (MTSBR) algorithm is developed for distribution networks with one redundant branch, which transforms the SMTDNR problem into an SMTOPF problem.

Smart construction technology has not spread as much as expected due to the rigidity of the traditional production system, and this study aims to analyze and present the factors affecting the success of smart construction technology. A research model was established to reflect the characteristics of smart construction technology based on the information system (IS) success theory and the technology acceptance model (TAM). An empirical analysis was conducted through the responses of 199 people surveyed online and offline for construction industry workers. It was found that variables that affect the usefulness include connection quality, systems, and services, as well as user innovation. Smart construction technology infrastructure and users&apos; innovation and usefulness have been found to affect their intention to use, and intelligence, service quality, and user innovation suitable for field characteristics have been found to affect ease of use. Factors affecting the performance of smart construction technology were found to be both usefulness and intention to use. The results of this study confirmed a causal relationship model that explains the factors influencing the success of smart construction technology. The results suggest that smart construction technology policymakers need to establish and implement policies for the parallel development of surrounding ecosystems to lead the development of smart construction technology. Smart construction technology development and sellers need to develop incentive programs that encourage users&apos; innovation. It was confirmed that the expansion and development of the surrounding ecosystem were necessary for the success of smart construction technology."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u9020\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fde\u63a5\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u3001\u7528\u6237\u521b\u65b0\u7b49\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u6709\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "research_question": "\u54ea\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u9020\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u9020\u6280\u672f\u672a\u5982\u9884\u671f\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u50f5\u5316\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6210\u529f\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u7406\u8bba\uff08IS Success Theory\uff09\u548c\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\uff08TAM\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7ebf\u4e0b\u8c03\u67e5199\u540d\u5efa\u7b51\u4e1a\u5de5\u4eba\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u8fde\u63a5\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u3001\u7528\u6237\u521b\u65b0\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u7528\u6237\u521b\u65b0\u5f71\u54cd\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u6613\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u6709\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\u5f71\u54cd\u6280\u672f\u7ee9\u6548\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u9020\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86IS\u548cTAM\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6fc0\u52b1\u7528\u6237\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the intermittency of renewable electricity and the availability of parallel revenue opportunities in both the electricity and hydrogen markets complicate the scheduling of green hydrogen production. The scheduling should maximise the total revenue from short-term sales of electricity and hydrogen against the long-term HPA delivery obligations. This challenge is addressed by developing a Bounded Fuzzy Logic Control (BFLC) which determines the daily HPA delivery target based on day-ahead forecasts of electricity and hydrogen prices, as well as wind capacity factors. Subsequently, the daily target is imposed as a constraint in dispatch optimisation which allocates energy and hydrogen flows for each hour of the day.Revenue comparisons over several years demonstrate that the BFLC achieves total annual revenues within 9\\% of optimal revenues that are based on perfect foresight. The BFLC revenues consistently exceed those of steady control, with the largest differences observed under conditions of elevated price levels and variability. The BFLC provides an effective long-term scheduling of green hydrogen production, enabling realistic revenue quantification that mitigates economic risks without overlooking economically viable projects."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u63a7\u5236\uff08BFLC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7eff\u8272\u6c22\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u77ed\u671f\u7535\u529b\u4e0e\u6c22\u6c14\u9500\u552e\u548c\u957f\u671f\u6c22\u8d2d\u4e70\u534f\u8bae\uff08HPA\uff09\u4ea4\u4ed8\u4e49\u52a1\u7684\u6536\u5165\u3002BFLC\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u4ef7\u3001\u6c22\u6c14\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u98ce\u80fd\u5bb9\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6bcf\u65e5HPA\u4ea4\u4ed8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cBFLC\u7684\u5e74\u6536\u5165\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u548c\u7535\u529b\u4e0e\u6c22\u6c14\u5e02\u573a\u5e76\u884c\u6536\u5165\u673a\u4f1a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7eff\u8272\u6c22\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u603b\u6536\u5165\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7eff\u8272\u6c22\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8d22\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7HPA\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u6536\u5165\u673a\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6709\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u63a7\u5236\uff08BFLC\uff09\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1BFLC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u4ef7\u3001\u6c22\u6c14\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u98ce\u80fd\u5bb9\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6bcf\u65e5HPA\u4ea4\u4ed8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u6c22\u6c14\u6d41\u91cf\u3002", "findings": "BFLC\u7684\u5e74\u6536\u5165\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u5165\uff08\u5dee\u8ddd\u57289%\u4ee5\u5185\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ef7\u683c\u9ad8\u6ce2\u52a8\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BFLC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7eff\u8272\u6c22\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "BFLC\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002"}}

Here we assess the life cycle environmental, economic and social impacts of three last-mile parcel delivery modes, namely BAU (parcels are delivered by an electric vehicle and a courier), UAV (parcels are delivered by UAVs), and CO (parcels are delivered by UAVs and electric vehicle), based on Monte Carlo simulations using real-world settings from a representative community. The results indicate that CO is the poorest-performing mode from the environmental perspective but is the best from the economic and social aspects. Our factorial analysis demonstrates that polymer lithium batteries reduce carbon emissions by 24.71% compared to lithium-ion batteries but cost 7.6 times more. We also observe that UAV generates lower carbon emissions in detached houses or for small parcels (0.10-1.99 kg and 0.0002-0.0199 m3) deliveries.

In today\u2019s complex global business environment, brokers play a key role in helping foreign entrepreneurs overcome the gap - liability of outsidership to access local networks. Yet, the cognitive and structural mechanisms behind brokers\u2019 decisions remain underexplored. Drawing on a multiple-case study of Chinese entrepreneurs in France, we theorize a cognitive-structural framework centered on two dimensions: the relative attractiveness of outsiders (i.e., their perceived value in terms of resources, knowledge, and offerings), and the tolerance for outsider replaceability (i.e., brokers\u2019 willingness to risk being bypassed after making an introduction). Our informants have played roles both as brokers and as outsiders, allowing us to capture how role-switching experiences shape their understanding of brokerage dynamics. While brokers are more likely to facilitate ties with highly attractive outsiders, their tolerance depends on the expected returns: it is \u2018low\u2019 when insiders offer more, \u2018moderate\u2019 when returns are in balance, and \u2018high\u2019 when outsiders are more valuable.

Traditional methods often face limitations in identifying and modeling the complex temporal dependencies inherent in streamflow data. Therefore, this study investigates the performance of two deep learning models\u2014 Patch Time Series Transformer (PatchTST) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) \u2014for daily streamflow forecasting of the Sefidrud River. The LSTM model is capable of capturing sequential and long-term dependencies in time series, whereas PatchTST leverages the Transformer architecture to extract both local and global features simultaneously. To enhance forecasting accuracy, an ensemble learning approach, including Stacking and Weighted Averaging methods is proposed, aiming to exploit the complementary strengths of the two models. The number of input lags was determined using a VAR approach, with two streamflow lag terms selected as model inputs. Model performance was evaluated using both numerical metrics and graphical analyses. The results indicate that the proposed Stacking Ensemble method outperforms individual models, achieving an RMSE=1.593 m\u00b3/s, MAE=1.333 m\u00b3/s, NS=0.991, and CC= 0.998.

Traditional screening methods assume that collusion occurs through secret agreements. However, recent research highlights that firms can use public announcements to coordinate decisions, reducing competition while avoiding detection. We propose a novel approach to screening for collusion in public corporate statements. Using natural language processing, we analyze more than 300, 000 earnings call transcripts issued worldwide between 2004 and 2022. By identifying expressions commonly associated with collusion, our method provides competition authorities with a tool to detect potentially anticompetitive behavior in public communications. Our approach can extend beyond earnings calls to other sources, such as news articles, trade press, and industry reports. Our method informed the European Commission\u2019s 2024 unannounced inspections in the car tire sector, prompted by concerns over price coordination through public communication."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5206\u6790\u4f01\u4e1a\u516c\u5f00\u58f0\u660e\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5171\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ade\u4e89\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f01\u4e1a\u516c\u5f00\u58f0\u660e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5171\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5171\u8c0b\u901a\u8fc7\u79d8\u5bc6\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u58f0\u660e\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u5171\u8c0b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67902004\u5e74\u81f32022\u5e74\u95f4\u5168\u740330\u591a\u4e07\u4efd\u8d22\u62a5\u7535\u8bdd\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5171\u8c0b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "findings": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5171\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6b27\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a2024\u5e74\u5bf9\u6c7d\u8f66\u8f6e\u80ce\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u7a81\u51fb\u68c0\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5171\u8c0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u58f0\u660e\u5728\u5171\u8c0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d22\u62a5\u7535\u8bdd\u4f1a\u8bae\u3001\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u7ae0\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u3002"}}

This article aims to investigate the socioeconomic and behavioural factors that influence individuals' decisions to reside in areas of high environmental risk. Using Casamicciola Terme (Isola d'Ischia, Italy) as a case study, a multidisciplinary framework integrating environmental economics, risk perception theory and game-theoretic modelling is developed. In addition, an empirical survey was conducted to assess resident awareness, trust in institutions and preference for transfer or mitigation. The results reveal a persistent gap between perceived and actual risk, influenced by familiarity, socioeconomic resilience and institutional credibility. In addition, economic policy instruments such as insurance schemes, compensation and tax incentives can significantly influence willingness to move.

This study examinesvarious optimization strategies applied to wholesale electricity markets and smart distribution networks, aimingto improve the integration of demand-side flexibility into system planning and operation. A thorough analysis ofaggregation mechanisms focuses on enhancing market stability and efficiency. To support this, advanced mathematicalmodels and optimization techniques are used to assess the response of consumers to both economicand operational signals. The research also explores tools for managing demand flexibility in smart grids, highlightingpractical challenges and opportunities for implementing local energy transaction schemes. The studyincludes a comparative evaluation of different international methodologies, covering regulated and liberalizedelectricity markets. Based on these insights, recommendations are made regarding market design and incentivestructures to encourage active consumer participation in aggregate demand management. The findings showthat effectively integrating demand flexibility not only strengthens the system\u2019s reliability but also facilitatesgreater penetration of renewable energy and reduces operational costs in wholesale markets and distributionnetworks.

Various factors influence the abnormal return of acquiring firms in M&A transactions, among which the cross-border status is particularly crucial. This study examines the effect of cross-border and domestic M&A transactions on acquirer price reactions, using a sample of 3893 M&A deals involving both public and private targets by United States listed firms, during the period 1999-2007. The results of the quantitative analysis indicate that cross-border M&A transactions generate lower stock returns for shareholders around the announcement date compared to domestic M&As. Additionally, acquirer size is negatively related to share returns, while the book-to-market ratio is positively associated with abnormal returns. Considering the public status of the target, this study finds that cross-border acquisitions of listed targets may lead to higher returns and mitigate the negative effects typically observed in cross-border M&As. With the findings, the study contributes to complementing existing literature and providing insights into M&A transactions by using comprehensive and typical M&A data.

The evaluation focused on 35 items, with 19 statements being eliminated after EFA and CFA. The SEM showed a satisfactory fit. The results challenge the established theories by revealing the lack of direct relationships between environmental sustainability and sustainability performance. Meanwhile, economic sustainability shows significant affect with CSR and SVT principles. The impact of social sustainability remains inconclusive, but partnerships affect sustainability performance. Leadership competencies affect the global rankings but not on sustainability performance.

This study conducted a total of 81 laboratory tests, varying flow rates, and salinity levels to evaluate the performance of ABCs in three distinct positions. Utilizing machine learning techniques\u2014specifically Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)\u2014the research aims to identify the optimal locations for ABC installation (L\u02ca) and their discharge (Qa). The findings indicate that the XGBoost model outperforms the others in predicting the discharge of ABCs, achieving R2 = 0.926, RMSE = 0.023, and MAE = 0.019. Utilizing XGBoost, sensitivity analysis revealed that the densimetric Froude number exerts the most significant influence on Qa. Optimization results utilizing XGBoost show that when the importance weights of objectives (\u03c9 Qa and \u03c9L\u02ca) are equal, the optimal location ratio (L\u02ca/Average freshwater depth) is approximately 0.52; however, as these weights change, the optimized location ratio varies accordingly.

Despite the availability of vast datasets across mining stages, much of this information remains underused in decision-making. This study presents an integrated, knowledge-based framework that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and high-fidelity simulation to model and optimise the full mine-to-mill process. Using publicly available data from the Barrick Cortez Mine in Nevada, USA, the mining chain from blasting to semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) was modelled using Orica\u2019s Integrated Extraction Simulator (IES). To mitigate the computational burden of full factorial simulations, three million scenarios were generated to evaluate performance sensitivity. Machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost, were trained and validated. The models achieved an accuracy of more than 90%, underscoring their reliability for predicting fragmentation outcomes. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret model predictions and quantify feature importance. The findings confirm a strong alignment between simulation and real-world data and highlight key operational parameters that affect downstream performance. This meta-model approach offers a powerful tool for real-time decision-making, enabling mining operations to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and support sustainable resource management."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u91c7\u77ff\u5230\u78e8\u77ff\u7684\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548cSHAP\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u91c7\u77ff\u5230\u78e8\u77ff\u7684\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u5bf9\u77ff\u4ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u91c7\u77ff\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u54c1\u4f4d\u77ff\u77f3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\uff09\u3001SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Orica\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff08IES\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u91c7\u77ff\u94fe\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "findings": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5e2e\u52a9\u91c7\u77ff\u4f5c\u4e1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Organization-wide operational delays along with inefficiencies emerge due to the absence of user-friendly real-time insights in traditional inventory systems. The research presents an advanced inventory management revolution through a new AI chatbot system based on Groq\u2019s Large Language Model (LLM) system. Through the system interface, users can conduct natural language requests to verify inventory information and monitor stock activities while receiving practical recommendations without requiring specialized knowledge. The backend implements FastAPI to merge with CSV or NoSQL database structures while providing scalable performance. The Streamlitbased front-end delivers a user-friendly, accessible interface that solves user interaction problems effectively. Research experiments have confirmed that this solution delivers both superb precision with fast execution times and substantially better user satisfaction than typical industry systems show. The research demonstrates how LLMs establish major supply chain operation reductions through a flexible solution that connects sophisticated information systems to end users.

With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources introducing variability and uncertainty into power grids, buildings, as significant electricity consumers, offer substantial potential for DR by dynamically adjusting their consumption. We develop a comprehensive model for building loads, incorporating economic factors through detailed dispatch cost calculations and employing a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)\u00a0based metric to manage uncertainties effectively. A novel training environment is constructed using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to fit marginal distributions of critical variables\u00a0and Vine Copulas to capture their complex multivariate dependencies, providing a high-fidelity simulation of market dynamics. This environment trains a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning agent to optimize quantity-price bidding decisions in continuous action spaces. The TD3 algorithm, with its twin critics and delayed policy updates, mitigates overestimation bias and ensures policy stability, outperforming traditional methods like the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Validation using ISO New England market data demonstrates that our approach significantly improves profitability and risk management for load aggregators, with the KDE-vine copula model offering superior accuracy over neural network-based alternatives and the TD3 agent achieving stable, high-reward outcomes."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7ade\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u7b51\u8d1f\u8377\u805a\u5408\u5546\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CVaR\u6307\u6807\u548cKDE-Vine Copula\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3TD3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7ade\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u7b51\u8d1f\u8377\u805a\u5408\u5546\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u5e76\u7f51\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7b51\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7528\u7535\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eCVaR\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001KDE-Vine Copula\u6a21\u578b\u548cTD3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5efa\u7b51\u8d1f\u8377\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u548cCVaR\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6784\u5efaKDE-Vine Copula\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3TD3\u4ee3\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u7ade\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "findings": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\uff0cKDE-Vine Copula\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTD3\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408CVaR\u548cKDE-Vine Copula\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u8d1f\u8377\u805a\u5408\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ade\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our empirical analysis relies on a dataset combining unprecedented granular data on procurement bids and equipment with patent data measuring suppliers\u2019 innovative performance. We identify the firm\u2019s innovative activity relevant to the bid by using an advanced neural network algorithm for text analysis. This procedure allows us to match in an original way firm\u2019s equipment descriptions with relevant patent documents. We then employ a difference-in-differences approach alongside a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of becoming a supplier on firms\u2019 patents in the relevant IPC classes. Our results show that firms becoming hospital suppliers have a significantly higher propensity to innovate. About the mechanism, we show that supplying AI-powered equipment further boosts the suppliers\u2019 innovative performance.

The existence of a private market for insurance such as contingent capital can eliminate the overinvestment incentives, leading to efficient outcomes. However, it does not eliminate fire sales. A central bank that can infuse liquidity cheaply may be motivated to intervene in the face of fire sales. If so, it can crowd out the private market and, if liquidity intervention is not priced at higher-than-breakeven rates, induce overinvestment. We examine various forms of public intervention to identify the least distortionary ones.

Japan has designed its Corporate Governance Code based on the premise that the Anglo-American governance system, which prioritizes capital markets and shareholder interests above all else, is the global standard. However, if we aim for a corporate governance system that emphasizes the social responsibility of companies, cross-shareholding is not necessarily a flaw in corporate governance. Rather, it can function as a mechanism to protect Japan's national interests.</span></p>\n<p><span>This paper first traces the evolution of cross-shareholding since the 1950s and confirms through literature review that the existence of stable shareholders through cross-shareholding contributed to long-term management, provided a stable environment for research and development for manufacturing companies, mitigated pressure from short-term shareholders, and contributed to management that took into account stakeholders other than shareholders, such as employees. Next, we showed that although \u201cmulti-stakeholder focus\u201d is now a fundamental principle, individual institutional designs incorporate systems that are compatible with maximizing shareholder value in financial capital markets, and that reforms based on soft law that prioritize capital markets have taken precedence over revisions to hard law such as the Companies Act, resulting in a system design and management that favors investors.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even today, the role of cross-shareholding in embodying the strengths of Japanese-style management remains unchanged. Rather, in the current stage where global capital flows and shareholder activism are becoming increasingly active, the paper highlights the need to recognize the necessity of a \u201cmodern version of cross-shareholding\u201d and suggests the need to reconsider the flexible utilization of cross-shareholding while appropriately and timely implementing reforms in both soft law and hard law.</span></p>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65e5\u672c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6301\u80a1\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u5e76\u975e\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u662f\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fd\u5bb6\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u8fd0\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u4ea4\u53c9\u6301\u80a1\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65e5\u672c\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u4ee5\u82f1\u7f8e\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u82e5\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f01\u4e1a\u793e\u4f1a\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6301\u80a1\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fd\u5bb6\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4ea4\u53c9\u6301\u80a1\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u7814\u53d1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u6cd5\u4e0e\u786c\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "findings": "\u4ea4\u53c9\u6301\u80a1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u7814\u53d1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6cbb\u7406\u4f53\u7cfb\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5229\u76ca\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u6301\u80a1\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fd\u5bb6\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u8f6f\u6cd5\u4e0e\u786c\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u8fd0\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6301\u80a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u793e\u4f1a\u8d23\u4efb\u3002"}}

Existing BIM-GIS integration methods face challenges such as low automation, inadequate spatial matching accuracy, and poor model loading efficiency. This study proposes a BIM-GIS integration modeling method based on global-local skeleton constraints. This method defines and extracts a global-local skeleton model as a geometric spatial constraint, automating BIM component layout and assembly. Simultaneously, an intelligent deployment mechanism is established to enable the automated invocation and efficient deployment of components.

Conventional hydrodynamic-based approaches are limited by their slow response time and are often computationally costly to achieve large-scale, high-resolution predictions. In this study, we present a hybrid framework that incorporates the traditional hydrodynamic models with an innovative, efficient FloodTransformer framework, enabling accurate, real-time, and high-resolution flood forecasting. We first schematise a 3Di hydrodynamic model based on the region\u2019s geographical characteristics, rigorously validating and calibrating it against real-world observations. Using this model, hundreds of simulations representing a wide range of rainfall patterns, initial water depths, and boundary conditions are then generated and used to train the AI model. To address the computational limitations preventing the adoption of advanced AI techniques for large-scale, fine-grained rasterised spatiotemporal analysis, our FloodTransformer introduces: (1) novel size embeddings to directly encode variable-sized grid cells, and (2) tokenised time-sequence encodings that capture multi-modal temporal dependencies without significant computational overhead. This temporal tokenisation mechanism also ensures efficient sequential predictions in a single run, minimising error accumulation in iterative prediction approaches. Furthermore, our physics-informed multi-task optimisation further enhances water depth prediction accuracy through integrated regularisation. Extensive experiments on both simulated datasets and real-world historical flood events are conducted using widely adopted hydrographic evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate FloodTransformer as an innovative solution for managing flash flooding risks with both high accuracy and computational efficiency."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0FloodTransformer\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cbe\u7ec6\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u6790\u7684AI\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u9650\u5236\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eAI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u6162\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eAI\u6280\u672f\uff08FloodTransformer\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u5c0f\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa3Di\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u5927\u5c0f\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "findings": "FloodTransformer\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eAI\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u6790\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u9650\u5236\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6d2a\u6c34\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u5bf9\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Synthesising formal epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation-whilst simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued.

Recently, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have greatly enhanced deforestation monitoring by enabling high-resolution and real-time detection of illegal activities and forest fires. However, effective UAV operations are significantly hindered by adverse weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, strong winds, dense fog, and extreme heat. In order to assess external environmental risks of UAV-based monitoring and explore effective risk mitigations, this paper presents a novel risk analysis methodology. We propose Risk-Driven Failure Mode Effect Analysis (RD-FMEA) that extends the conventional FMEA by incorporating risk factors affecting the failure modes of system components. RD-FMEA introduces fuzzy logic to assign the risk scores to individual failure modes associated with the identified risk factors. We apply RD-FMEA to a UAV-based deforestation monitoring system considering the risk of adverse weather conditions. The risk analysis results suggest that heavy rainfall poses the most significant risk that can involve many failure modes. We further investigate four different mitigation approaches against adverse weather conditions and evaluate their effectiveness. Through the comparative analysis of RD-FMEA results, we find that the introduction of an intelligent water drops algorithm can significantly reduce the risk scores, by helping UAVs\u2019 route planning to avoid heavy rainfalls. Moreover, we show that the risk scores can be further reduced by adding rules to abort missions by predefined time threshold to avoid unsafe continuous UAV operations in adverse weather conditions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRD-FMEA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u76d1\u6d4b\u65f6\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u6ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u76d1\u6d4b\u65f6\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u98ce\u9669\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u963b\u788d\u5176\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\uff08FMEA\uff09\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\uff08RD-FMEA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRD-FMEA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u66b4\u96e8\u662f\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u6ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9884\u8bbe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfFMEA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRD-FMEA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5982\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

In East Africa, rapid population growth and climate change impacts intensify demands for water, energy, and food (WEF), fuelling resource exploitation. Sustainable development plans aim to meet resource demands while building resilience, necessitating a multi-sectoral approach. This study employs a mixed-qualitative methodology to explore the interlinkages between nationally determined contributions, national adaptation plans and regional development in East Africa. Results show implied connections between policy instruments, sustainable development, and climate action form the crux of WEF interlinkages. WEF resource insecurity is worsened by incoherent national development plans, which create competition for shared resources and tradeoffs instead of fostering collaboration. For example, the focus on food security, mostly through extensification, has created tradeoffs with water and energy security, undermining development goals. Understanding the interconnectedness and interdependencies between sector policies, climate actions, and supranational development plans could catalyse and accelerate Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 13 and goals related to the Paris Agreement.

Through his academic excellence, legal expertise, and political activism, he championed the rights of the marginalized, particularly the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. His concept of social justice extended beyond legal equality to encompass economic empowerment, gender justice, and the annihilation of caste. As a constitutionalist, he ensured that democratic principles and human rights were embedded in the Indian legal framework.

Recently, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have greatly enhanced deforestation monitoring by enabling high-resolution and real-time detection of illegal activities and forest fires. However, effective UAV operations are significantly hindered by adverse weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, strong winds, dense fog, and extreme heat. In order to assess external environmental risks of UAV-based monitoring and explore effective risk mitigations, this paper presents a novel risk analysis methodology. We propose Risk-Driven Failure Mode Effect Analysis (RD-FMEA) that extends the conventional FMEA by incorporating risk factors affecting the failure modes of system components. RD-FMEA introduces fuzzy logic to assign the risk scores to individual failure modes associated with the identified risk factors. We apply RD-FMEA to a UAV-based deforestation monitoring system considering the risk of adverse weather conditions. The risk analysis results suggest that heavy rainfall poses the most significant risk that can involve many failure modes. We further investigate four different mitigation approaches against adverse weather conditions and evaluate their effectiveness. Through the comparative analysis of RD-FMEA results, we find that the introduction of an intelligent water drops algorithm can significantly reduce the risk scores, by helping UAVs\u2019 route planning to avoid heavy rainfalls. Moreover, we show that the risk scores can be further reduced by adding rules to abort missions by predefined time threshold to avoid unsafe continuous UAV operations in adverse weather conditions."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRD-FMEA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u914d\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u66b4\u96e8\u662f\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u6ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u5176\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\uff08FMEA\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\uff08RD-FMEA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u914d\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528RD-FMEA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "findings": "\u66b4\u96e8\u662f\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u6ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RD-FMEA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfFMEA\uff0c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5982\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u6ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u3002"}}

Weaker IPR diminishes the ability of U.S. suppliers to appropriate the returns from their R&amp;D investments, leading them to reduce R&amp;D spending by 13% and R&amp;D-related hiring by 9%. Post-sanctions, suppliers to sanctioned firms also shift their IP protection strategy: patent filings decline by 10%, while mentions of trade secrets in regulatory filings rise by 47%. These effects are stronger when sanctioned entities are likely to reverse-engineer their suppliers' technology and weaker when domestic competition necessitates U.S. firms to innovate. The impact is most pronounced in patent-intensive industries and for suppliers who hold patents in sanctioned countries. Our findings suggest that export controls may unintentionally fuel foreign innovation and IP appropriation, prompting U.S. firms to scale back innovation and favor secrecy over patenting."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u51fa\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u53d7\u5236\u88c1\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5916\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u52a0\u901f\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u51cf\u5c11\u7814\u53d1\u6295\u5165\u548c\u4e13\u5229\u7533\u62a5\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5546\u4e1a\u79d8\u5bc6\u3002", "research_question": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u51fa\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u51fa\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u521b\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5916\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u610f\u5916\u540e\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u51fa\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u540e\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u6295\u5165\u3001\u4e13\u5229\u7533\u62a5\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u79d8\u5bc6\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u51fa\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u51cf\u5c1113%\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u6295\u5165\u548c9%\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u76f8\u5173\u62db\u8058\uff0c\u4e13\u5229\u7533\u62a5\u51cf\u5c1110%\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u79d8\u5bc6\u63d0\u53ca\u589e\u52a047%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u51fa\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51fa\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6743\u8861\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Policymakers and scholars have focused on ensuring regulatory approval and market entry of lower-priced competitors to brand drugs, but few have analyzed a subsequent stage of competition: being accessible to consumers.&nbsp; Just because a manufacturer is permitted to sell a lower-priced product does not mean that more affordable version will be made available to patients.&nbsp;<br><br> Here, the frequently-discussed pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) play a role. PBMs create and maintain formularies, lists of drugs covered by insurance plans. Because of the leading PBMs' market power, drugs not covered on formularies tend to be inaccessible to patients. Formularies were supposed to encourage the use of cost-effective drugs. But today, it seems that PBMs are using formularies to increase their own financial rewards.&nbsp;<br><br> In this essay, we examine a new development in PBMs' conduct: the allowance of a limited amount of self-serving competition on formularies. The largest PBMs have recently&nbsp;gotten into the business of selling drugs in combination with&nbsp;drug manufacturers. These PBMs also have excluded from their formularies drugs&nbsp;competing with those in&nbsp;which the PBM&nbsp;and some manufacturers have a common financial interest, even if that would not&nbsp;be the most cost-effective option for patients. Although this self-serving competition could reduce prices in the short term, it threatens at least two downsides: (1) forestalling even greater price reductions and (2) harming long-term competition and innovation.&nbsp;<br><br> This essay explains PBMs' role in&nbsp;creating formularies, increasing use of formulary exclusion,&nbsp;and newfound involvement with selling drugs. It then analyzes the competitive effects&nbsp;of this new behavior and analyzes potential antitrust claims including self-preferencing, exclusive dealing, collusion, and&nbsp;unfair competition."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u54c1\u724c\u836f\u4ef7\u683c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u836f\u623f\u798f\u5229\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\uff08PBMs\uff09\u5728\u9650\u5236\u4f4e\u4ef7\u836f\u7269\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "research_question": "PBMs\u7684\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u5229\u6027\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u836f\u7269\u9500\u552e\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u54c1\u724c\u836f\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u54c1\u724c\u836f\u4ef7\u683c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u5236\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ade\u4e89\uff0cPBMs\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9650\u5236\u4f4e\u4ef7\u836f\u7269\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\u3001PBMs\u5728\u533b\u836f\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "PBMs\u7684\u81ea\u5229\u6027\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u964d\u4f4e\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u671f\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u66f4\u5927\u964d\u4ef7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u7ade\u4e89\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86PBMs\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u836f\u7269\u4ef7\u683c\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8ePBMs\u884c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u52a0\u5f3a\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002"}}

Expanding from the \u2018success criteria\u2019 of collaboration for sustainable agriculture by Velten et al. (2021), we identified five formative dimensions \u2013 governance, leadership, facilitation, group characteristics and context \u2013 influencing the outcomes of FCs, before analysing these dimensions in more detail.ResultsWe found that the five dimensions are interdependent and dynamic, affecting the functioning of the FCs, and leading to different levels of maturity. Comparing the situation of each FC regarding the five dimensions and the level of maturity we found that the FCs started in distinct contexts with diverse initial conditions across Europe \u2013 from favourable to unfavourable. This led to different dynamic trajectories on a pathway to biodiversity sensitive farming.SignificanceThe maturity assessment matrix offers a valuable tool for FCs to reflect on their progress and capacity in achieving their goals, guiding future efforts for effective FC management."}, "AI": {"tldr": "FRAMEwork\u9879\u76ee\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb11\u4e2a\u6b27\u6d32\u519c\u6c11\u96c6\u7fa4\uff08FCs\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u521b\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f71\u54cdFCs\u6210\u679c\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "research_question": "FRAMEwork\u519c\u6c11\u96c6\u7fa4\uff08FCs\uff09\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u521b\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6b27\u6d32\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9000\u5316\u548c\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5FCs\u5728\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u519c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eVelten\u7b49\u4eba\uff082021\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u519c\u4e1a\u534f\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f71\u54cdFCs\u6210\u679c\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf911\u4e2aFCs\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u3002", "findings": "\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdFCs\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30FCs\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u519c\u4e1a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3aFCs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5176\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u654f\u611f\u519c\u4e1a\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

The study employed a multiple case study design and was underpinned by the Social Model of Disability. A mixed methods approach was adopted employing online questionnaires, in-depth interviews to gather data from university librarians, heads of the physical development office, heads of disability units and students with visual, mobile, and hearing impairments. An observation checklist for access to the library facilities and resources was conducted, and the data were analysed thematically.\u00a0 Findings revealed that most of the university libraries were not universally designed to accommodate the needs of students with disabilities which impacted negatively on information access, participation, and academic performance of these students. The study found that universal design helps to eliminate discrimination and marginalization, promotes barrier-free environments which accommodate diverse individuals in university libraries, promotes equity and inclusion of persons with disabilities in higher institutions.The study recommends the redesign of university libraries\u2019 facilities, services, and policies to conform to universal design principles to accommodate users, especially those with disabilities, and adequate budget allocation should be made for redesigning libraries for the inclusion of SWDs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u52a0\u7eb3\u5341\u6240\u516c\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u901a\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u4ee5\u5bb9\u7eb3\u6b8b\u75be\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u672a\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6b8b\u75be\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u8bae\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "research_question": "\u52a0\u7eb3\u516c\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u901a\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u4ee5\u5bb9\u7eb3\u6b8b\u75be\u5b66\u751f\uff1f", "motivation": "\u6b8b\u75be\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u969c\u788d\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u6b8b\u75be\u6a21\u578b\uff08Social Model of Disability\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u7ebf\u95ee\u5377\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6e05\u5355\u3002", "findings": "\u591a\u6570\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u672a\u6309\u901a\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6b8b\u75be\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6d88\u9664\u6b67\u89c6\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u6b8b\u75be\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u9884\u7b97\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6b8b\u75be\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

By integrating these data sources using a two-stage machine learning approach, the study aims to provide a more accurate assessment of energy efficiency improvement and identify the most effective retrofitting strategies for reducing energy burdens on LIHs."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408RECS\u548cAHS\u4e24\u5927\u56fd\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u4f4f\u623f\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u6539\u9020\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u7a7a\u767d\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408RECS\u548cAHS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u4f4f\u623f\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u6539\u9020\u6548\u679c\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u8017\u5360\u7f8e\u56fd\u603b\u80fd\u8017\u768440%\uff0c\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u56e0\u5c45\u4f4f\u8001\u65e7\u4f4e\u6548\u80fd\u623f\u5c4b\u800c\u627f\u53d7\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u56fd\u6027\u6570\u636e\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408RECS\u548cAHS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u9020\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5168\u56fd\u6027\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u4f4f\u623f\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u6539\u9020\u6548\u679c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u9020\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

Altogether, the central, regional, and local governments launch more than 5000 institutional advertising and communication contracts. In Spain, these tenders are governed by Law 9/2017 on Public Sector Contracts and Law 19/2013 on Transparency, Access to Public Information and Good Governance, in compliance with which governments have developed openly accessible websites that provide practical information on the contracts for interested individuals and companies. This paper compares all regional procurement platforms through the study of a hundred institutional communication public contracts launched in 2021, assessing the usefulness of the published content, detecting good practices, and identifying gaps and areas of improvement. The results obtained support the idea that these platforms do not provide exhaustive information on public contracts, which limits their potential as tools aimed at ensuring competition and transparency in public contracts. Based on this last criterion, a ranking is created among the regions analysed. \n<div>\n <span><br></span>\n</div>\n<div>\n <span><b>Spanish Abstract:</b> Con una inversi\u00f3n de m\u00e1s de 700 millones de euros, el sector p\u00fablico es el principal anunciante en el mercado espa\u00f1ol.

Este trabajo compara todas las plataformas regionales de contrataci\u00f3n mediante el estudio de cien contratos p\u00fablicos de comunicaci\u00f3n institucional lanzados en 2021, evaluando la utilidad del contenido publicado, detectando buenas pr\u00e1cticas e identificando deficiencias y \u00e1reas de mejora. Los resultados obtenidos respaldan la idea de que estas plataformas no proporcionan informaci\u00f3n exhaustiva sobre los contratos p\u00fablicos, lo que limita su potencial como herramientas destinadas a garantizar la competencia y la transparencia en la contrataci\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Sobre la base de este \u00faltimo criterio, se crea un ranking entre las regiones analizadas.</span>\n</div>"}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8\u5e7f\u544a\u5408\u540c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf92021\u5e74100\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u5408\u540c\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "research_question": "\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u5404\u5730\u533a\u516c\u5171\u91c7\u8d2d\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e7f\u544a\u5408\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f", "motivation": "\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8\u662f\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5e7f\u544a\u6295\u653e\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5408\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u5408\u540c\u6cd5\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u76849/2017\u548c19/2013\u53f7\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9100\u4e2a2021\u5e74\u7684\u516c\u5171\u5408\u540c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u53f0\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "findings": "\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u91c7\u8d2d\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u5404\u5730\u533a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6392\u540d\u3002"}}

Fewer jobs are needed to keep up with the growth of the labor force, and growth rates of output and consumption will fall even if per capita output and consumption hold steady. The total US population is growing at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent, down from 1 percent in late 2023. I estimate the breakeven rate of monthly payroll growth in the jobs report needed to keep up with the labor force has fallen from 166,000 jobs in early 2024 to 86,000 jobs in June 2025. Accordingly, policymakers need to lower their targets and forecasts for key economic data and put more weight on per capita and other population-invariant measures. Adjusting expectations in light of slower population growth is essential for setting monetary policy, determining whether the United States is in recession, and other data-driven decisions and interpretations. With slower population growth, any given level of monthly payroll growth, consumption growth, or output growth reflects a stronger economy than it did a year ago. Population growth is not only slowing; it has also become more volatile and harder to estimate. It is likely that current population estimates for 2025 that statistical agencies are incorporating into economic data are too high and will be revised downward; current population estimates imply much higher immigration in 2025 than is likely under current administration policy. Economic data will need to be reinterpreted and revised in line with future adjustments to population estimates."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb18\u4e2a\u6708\u663e\u8457\u653e\u7f13\uff0c\u79fb\u6c11\u6f6e\u7ed3\u675f\u548c\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u589e\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6570\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u4eba\u5747\u6307\u6807\u3002", "research_question": "\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u653e\u7f13\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u653e\u7f13\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u4eba\u53e3\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "findings": "\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u901f\u964d\u81f30.5%\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u9700\u4e0b\u8c03\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u653e\u7f13\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u8bfb\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8c03\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u4eba\u5747\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

Accelerator programs play an important role in supporting startups' scaling ambitions by offering in-depth entrepreneurial learning opportunities. In this study, we examine whether and how such programs can facilitate startup internationalization. To this end, we leverage a unique dataset that combines proprietary application data from the German Accelerator (GA)-a government-financed program designed to support startups' international market entry-with detailed startup-level, founder, and investment information. We find that participating startups significantly raised funding and hired more employees in the GA's target countries relative to a comparison group of startups that were admitted, but did not attend for exogenous reasons. Consistent with our theoretical considerations about an experiential learning mechanism, these effects are muted for startups that took part in online programs that were introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the results are strongest among startups with limited international experience prior to participating. We further support these mechanisms with qualitative evidence from surveying GA alumni. Our study advances the understanding of the potential and limitations of startup accelerators in supporting international market entry, a key strategy for many entrepreneurial ventures today."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u9879\u76ee\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u521b\u4e1a\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u56fd\u9645\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53c2\u4e0e\u5fb7\u56fd\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff08GA\uff09\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u56fd\u5bb6\u878d\u8d44\u548c\u62db\u8058\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u4e0a\u9879\u76ee\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u6548\u679c\u6700\u663e\u8457\u3002", "research_question": "\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u9879\u76ee\u662f\u5426\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u5316\uff1f", "motivation": "\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u662f\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u6210\u957f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdb\u5165\u5916\u56fd\u5e02\u573a\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u9879\u76ee\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5fb7\u56fd\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff08GA\uff09\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u7533\u8bf7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u3001\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\u8865\u5145\u3002", "findings": "\u53c2\u4e0eGA\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u56fd\u5bb6\u878d\u8d44\u548c\u62db\u8058\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u4e0a\u9879\u76ee\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u6548\u679c\u6700\u663e\u8457\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u652f\u6301\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u652f\u6301\u56fd\u9645\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Drawing on a translog production function and the decomposition method developed by Kumbhakar et al. in 1999, we analyze a panel dataset of 2,412 publicly listed firms in G7 countries from 1989 to 2023. The findings suggest that climate policy uncertainty does not influence total factor productivity immediately. Instead, its impact emerges over time as firms gradually respond to regulatory shifts. Technological change reacts quickly and positively, indicating that uncertainty can stimulate innovation. Allocative efficiency improves at a slower pace, reflecting the time needed for firms to adjust their resource allocations once policy direction becomes clearer. The effects on scale efficiency vary across firms and are shaped by characteristics such as size and liquidity. Companies with larger cash reserves often delay strategic input adjustments, suggesting that financial flexibility can reduce responsiveness. These outcomes highlight the dynamic and multifaceted nature of corporate adaptation to policy uncertainty. To support long-term productivity gains, climate policies should emphasize clarity, stability, and institutional credibility. Encouraging innovation is important, but helping firms reallocate resources effectively under uncertain conditions is equally essential. A predictable and gradual policy trajectory can reduce unnecessary caution, promote timely adjustments, and facilitate a more efficient transition toward sustainable practices."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u7387\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u9010\u6b65\u663e\u73b0\u3002\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc5\u901f\u4e14\u79ef\u6781\uff0c\u800c\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u7387\u6539\u5584\u8f83\u6162\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u56e0\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u6ce8\u91cd\u6e05\u6670\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u957f\u671f\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "research_question": "\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u7387\uff09\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u4f01\u4e1a\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u957f\u671f\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eKumbhakar\u7b49\u4eba\uff081999\uff09\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bf9\u6570\u751f\u4ea7\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790G7\u56fd\u5bb62,412\u5bb6\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f81989\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "findings": "\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u9010\u6b65\u663e\u73b0\u3002\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc5\u901f\u4e14\u79ef\u6781\uff0c\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u7387\u6539\u5584\u8f83\u6162\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u56e0\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u6ce8\u91cd\u653f\u7b56\u6e05\u6670\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4f01\u4e1a\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u6548\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a scalable administrative architecture that enabled continuity, compliance, and cohesion despite geopolitical instability, varying legal codes, and extreme cultural divergence. Case illustrations focus on workforce synchronization, time-zone-sensitive coordination, decentralized asset control, and ERP deployment.

This study examines the causal relationship between female education and multidimensional energy poverty using quasi-experimental variation from Bangladesh&apos;s Female Secondary School Stipend Program (FSSSP), implemented from 1994 to 2008. Exploiting geographic and temporal variation in program exposure, we employ a two-stage least squares approach with data from three waves (2010, 2016, 2022) of the nationally representative Household Income and Expenditure Survey covering 48,123 households. Each additional year of female education reduces energy poverty by 0.12 points on our multidimensional index, representing a 39% improvement relative to the control group mean. Female education systematically shifts household energy consumption from traditional biomass fuels toward cleaner alternatives, with particularly large effects on severe energy poverty. The impacts operate through multiple mechanisms including economic empowerment (10% increase in wealth), demographic transitions (smaller household size, fewer children), assortative mating (19.5% increase in spouse education), and enhanced infrastructure decision-making agency. Threshold analysis reveals transformative effects at eighth-grade completion, while heterogeneity analysis shows benefits are concentrated among the poorest households. These findings provide the rigorous causal evidence that investments in female education generate substantial co-benefits for energy poverty reduction beyond their direct educational impacts, supporting integrated development approaches that recognize complementarities between human capital investments and energy access objectives."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\u5b66\u5956\u5b66\u91d1\u8ba1\u5212\uff08FSSSP\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5973\u6027\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u6bcf\u591a\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u5e74\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u6307\u6570\u964d\u4f4e0.12\u5206\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\u768439%\u6539\u5584\u3002", "research_question": "\u5973\u6027\u6559\u80b2\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u7ef4\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\uff1f", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u6709\u8d85\u8fc720\u4ebf\u4eba\u9762\u4e34\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528FSSSP\u7684\u5730\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5168\u56fd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u4e0e\u652f\u51fa\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0848,123\u6237\uff09\u3002", "findings": "\u5973\u6027\u6559\u80b2\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5bb6\u5ead\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u8d28\u71c3\u6599\u8f6c\u5411\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5973\u6027\u6559\u80b2\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d4b\u6743\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u8f6c\u578b\u3001\u914d\u5076\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u51b3\u7b56\u6743\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u5973\u6027\u6559\u80b2\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u6e90\u8d2b\u56f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u6295\u8d44\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u53d1\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Through Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR), Partially Linear Functional-Coefficient (PLFC) panel modelling, and Difference-in-Differences (DID) estimations, the results consistently show that energy policy risk exacerbates low-carbon energy risk, particularly in higher-risk countries and within specific climate risk intervals. DID findings further suggest that Chinese fossil energy investments significantly increase low-carbon energy risk, while renewable-only investments show no effect. Analysis of U.S. administrations reveals varied influences: Bush-era policies appear to reduce risk, whereas Trump and Biden interventions heighten it through different channels.

We test the moment conditions implied by the no-arbitrage hypothesis by applying a simulated method of moments and a general specification test. For each of the five cryptocurrencies considered, the test is applied globally using the full sample and locally using a rolling window approach. Globally, the results show that the null hypothesis of no-arbitrage is rejected for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but is not rejected for Binance Coin and for the two stablecoins, USD Coin and Tether. Locally, the hypothesis is never rejected for USD Coin and is rejected 5.5% of the time for Tether. In comparison, the test rejects the hypothesis frequently for the three studied native cryptocurrencies (39.5% of the time for Bitcoin, 26% for Ethereum, and 21.5% for Binance Coin)."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u9a8c\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u548c\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5b58\u5728\u5957\u5229\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u5219\u57fa\u672c\u7b26\u5408\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u5047\u8bf4\u3002", "research_question": "\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u5047\u8bf4\uff1f", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5957\u5229\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u5047\u8bf4\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u77e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6eda\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u77e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6eda\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u9a8c\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u5047\u8bf4\u3002", "findings": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u548c\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5728\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\uff08USD Coin\u548cTether\uff09\u57fa\u672c\u672a\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u4e3a\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u5047\u8bf4\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5957\u5229\u673a\u4f1a\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

A dust concentration prediction and suppression system integrating monitoring, forecasting, and treatment has been developed. Industrial-grade sensors are used to ensure real-time and high-precision monitoring of dust concentration and environmental parameters. By constructing a multi-component hybrid model based on the CNN-BiLSTM-Transformer architecture, accurate dust concentration prediction is achieved. The system finally adaptively suppresses dust emissions and effectively inhibits dust diffusion through a gas-liquid two-phase spraying mechanism that takes into account dust particle size and concentration. The experimental results confirm the significant advantages of this method: the dust concentration prediction model achieves performance indicators of MAE: 3.4425, RMSE: 4.4319, and R\u00b2: 0.9620. The system maintains an average response delay within 5 seconds, the dust suppression efficiency reaches 90.09%, and the overall treatment cost is reduced by 35% compared with traditional methods, thus providing an efficient and cost-effective technical solution for dynamic mine dust control."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ee5\u9732\u5929\u7164\u77ff\u6392\u571f\u573a\u77ff\u7528\u9053\u8def\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u96c6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u4e8e\u4e00\u4f53\u7684\u7c89\u5c18\u6d53\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6291\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c89\u5c18\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCNN-BiLSTM-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c89\u5c18\u6d53\u5ea6\u7cbe\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u7c89\u5c18\u7c92\u5f84\u4e0e\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u6c14\u6db2\u4e24\u76f8\u55b7\u96fe\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6291\u5236\u7c89\u5c18\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u7c89\u5c18\u6269\u6563\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7c89\u5c18\u6d53\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e3aMAE:3.4425\u3001RMSE:4.4319\u3001R\u00b2:0.9620\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a7\u5236\u57285\u79d2\u5185\uff0c\u6291\u5c18\u6548\u7387\u8fbe90.09%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6cbb\u7406\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e35%\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u77ff\u5c71\u7c89\u5c18\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u9732\u5929\u7164\u77ff\u6392\u571f\u573a\u77ff\u7528\u9053\u8def\u7684\u7c89\u5c18\u6d53\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6291\u5236\uff1f", "motivation": "\u9732\u5929\u7164\u77ff\u6392\u571f\u573a\u77ff\u7528\u9053\u8def\u7684\u7c89\u5c18\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7c89\u5c18\u6cbb\u7406\u6280\u672f\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8eCNN-BiLSTM-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u6db2\u4e24\u76f8\u55b7\u96fe\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u7c89\u5c18\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efaCNN-BiLSTM-Transformer\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6c14\u6db2\u4e24\u76f8\u55b7\u96fe\u673a\u5236\u6291\u5236\u7c89\u5c18\u3002", "findings": "\u7c89\u5c18\u6d53\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684MAE\u4e3a3.4425\u3001RMSE\u4e3a4.4319\u3001R\u00b2\u4e3a0.9620\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c0f\u4e8e5\u79d2\uff0c\u6291\u5c18\u6548\u7387\u8fbe90.09%\uff0c\u6cbb\u7406\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e35%\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eCNN-BiLSTM-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7c89\u5c18\u6d53\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7c89\u5c18\u6cbb\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u77ff\u5c71\u7c89\u5c18\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our findings challenge the conventional view of slow RER adjustment by demonstrating that larger mispricings are corrected much faster, while smaller deviations persist for longer periods. We identify a valuation threshold effect, where smaller deviations behave like unit root processes, while larger discrepancies are more quickly mean-reverting. Furthermore, the magnitude of these thresholds decrease as the evaluation time horizon increases. Transaction costs play a crucial role in shaping these dynamics, with higher costs associated with wider thresholds for arbitrage activity. Additionally, the results reveal asymmetry in RER adjustments, where undervaluations are corrected more rapidly than overvaluations. These findings provide new insights into the speed and nature of RER adjustments, suggesting that product-specific price data, such as that from iPads, can offer a more granular understanding of international price convergence."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u82f9\u679ciPad\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5b9e\u9645\u6c47\u7387\uff08RER\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u66f4\u5feb\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5219\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u4e45\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4f30\u503c\u9608\u503c\u6548\u5e94\u5728RER\u8c03\u6574\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "research_question": "\u5b9e\u9645\u6c47\u7387\uff08RER\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u901f\u5ea6\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u4ef7\u683c\u504f\u5dee\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3aRER\u8c03\u6574\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u504f\u5dee\u5927\u5c0f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9891\u6570\u636e\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027RER\u52a8\u6001\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u7403\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u82f9\u679ciPad\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "findings": "\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u504f\u5dee\u66f4\u5feb\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u4e45\uff1b\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4f30\u503c\u9608\u503c\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8c03\u6574\u901f\u5ea6\uff1bRER\u8c03\u6574\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08\u4f4e\u4f30\u4fee\u6b63\u66f4\u5feb\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027RER\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ef7\u683c\u504f\u5dee\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u56fd\u9645\u4ef7\u683c\u6536\u655b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bf9\u6c47\u7387\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Using China&apos;s Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle (CCEC) as a case study, this research employs a Water-Carbon-Soil (WCS) nexus framework to: (1) quantify spatiotemporal mismatches and trade-offs/synergies between ES supply and urbanization-driven demand, (2) reveal driving mechanisms underlying natural constraints and anthropogenic pressures, and (3) establish a three-tier adaptive zoning system where each zone implements hierarchical governance strategies to address region-specific supply-demand imbalances. Key findings reveal:(1) During 2000-2020, all three ES exhibited significant supply-demand clustering: Low supply-low demand clusters dominated water yield (WY, 20%) and soil retention (SR, 22%), while carbon sequestration (CS) was characterized predominantly by high supply-low demand clusters (26%).(2) The overall ES supply-demand balance deteriorated, with the Composite Ecosystem Supply-Demand Ratio (CESDR) declining from 0.149 to 0.111. This shift manifested spatially as \"dual-core deficit expansion with peripheral surplus contraction\".(3) Primary drivers of CESDR variation were population density (POP, mean \u03b2 = -0.236), gross domestic product (GDP, mean \u03b2 = -0.641), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, mean \u03b2 = 0.322), indicating negative anthropogenic pressures versus positive vegetation-mediated effects.(4) By integrating ES clustering patterns, CESDR dynamics, and key drivers, we delineated Core Restoration Zones, Flexible Regulation Zones, and Ecological Priority Conservation Zones at county and grid scales. This framework establishes a replicable paradigm for balancing ecological security and socioeconomic development in mega-urban agglomerations."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u4e2d\u56fd\u6210\u6e1d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5708\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6c34-\u78b3-\u571f\u58e4\uff08WCS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\uff08ES\uff09\u4f9b\u9700\u65f6\u7a7a\u9519\u914d\u53ca\u534f\u540c/\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5206\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\uff08ES\uff09\u4f9b\u9700\u65f6\u7a7a\u9519\u914d\u53ca\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4f9b\u9700\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u5206\u533a\u76ee\u6807\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\uff08ES\uff09\u4f9b\u9700\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u5206\u533a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6c34-\u78b3-\u571f\u58e4\uff08WCS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91cf\u5316ES\u4f9b\u9700\u65f6\u7a7a\u9519\u914d\u53ca\u534f\u540c/\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e09\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5206\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "findings": "1. 2000-2020\u5e74\uff0cES\u4f9b\u9700\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b2. \u6574\u4f53\u4f9b\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6076\u5316\uff1b3. \u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u4e3a\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001GDP\u548c\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7ea7\u5206\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51faWCS\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e09\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5206\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u6210\u6e1d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5708\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u8d85\u5927\u57ce\u5e02\u7fa4\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5206\u533a\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional estimators that dependon idealized array models or extensive calibration, our approach exploitsa tensor-based representation of the received signal to leverage its multidi-mensional structure. A key innovation is the use of a mode-2 tensor factor-ization to decouple time-delay estimation from spatial distortions, yieldinga surrogate cost function that directly measures the time-delay alignmenterror. We then apply Bayesian optimization, guided by a Gaussian processsurrogate and an expected improvement acquisition function, to efficientlynavigate the time-delay parameter space. To guard against outliers andfurther improve accuracy, we integrate a nonlinear least-squares refinementstep using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with bounds (L-BFGS-B)algorithm as a second stage. Simulation results demonstrate that the pro-posed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques such asleast square katri-rao factorization (LSKRF), achieving sub-meter accuracyeven in the presence of array calibration errors and multipath."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u5f84\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u7684GNSS\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65f6\u5ef6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u5f84\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0GNSS\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65f6\u5ef6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u9635\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5f84\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f-2\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u5ef6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "findings": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LSKRF\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u9635\u5217\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u591a\u5f84\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e9a\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65f6\u5ef6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3aGNSS\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65f6\u5ef6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Based on their approach, we examine the well-being dynamics among Brazilian states from 2002 to 2017. Our findings reveal a substantial improvement in well-being across nearly all states, with life expectancy emerging as the primary driver of this enhancement. Over the period, we observed a substantial 47% average increase in well-being, surpassing income growth by a substantial margin of 25 percentage points. Moreover, GDP per capita and well-being exhibited convergence.

The network incorporates feeder nodes and routing shipments in the spoke\u2013feeder segment. We also consider wave height uncertainty, which affects cargo handling duration at feeder ports, as observed in a real archipelagic network. Specifically, this involves the enforced use of ship-to-ship (STS) cargo handling in a designated calm area, as opposed to the conventional berthing method in the event of high waves near the jetty. Stochastic optimization is typically used to address this type of problem. However, we found that the stochastic solution provided does not perfectly capture the uncertainty. We thus proposed the integration of stochastic optimization and Monte Carlo simulation, in which a genetic algorithm-based solution is subsequently assessed with a Monte Carlo simulation to generate a risk-optimized solution. A real-world network is used as a case study, showcasing a risk-optimized solution that offers a better likelihood of maintaining performance under uncertainty compared to the solution provided by stochastic optimization. Managerial insight is also derived from the numerical result."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7fa4\u5c9b\u6269\u5c55\u67a2\u7ebd\u8f90\u5c04\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u89e3\u51b3\u7fa4\u5c9b\u6269\u5c55\u67a2\u7ebd\u8f90\u5c04\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "findings": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u7fa4\u5c9b\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Leveraging the U.S. China trade war in 2018 as a plausibly exogenous source of negative trade shocks, we find that firms more exposed to the trade shock hire more executives with overseas experience, especially those with marketing expertise and backgrounds in European markets. Consistent with increased demand for such expertise, these executives receive higher compensation following the onset of the trade war, especially through equity-based incentives. We provide suggestive evidence that these executives contribute to maintaining overseas revenue and expanding foreign subsidiaries.

Between 2022 and 2024, the Bank of Japan resumed unannounced yen-buying interventions under this delayed disclosure scheme, allowing us to isolate the signaling effect of official confirmation from other simultaneously operating channels. Using high-frequency USD/JPY data and a self-controlled design that compares disclosure days to non-disclosure days, we find that official disclosure leads to a significant appreciation of \u00a50.265 per dollar. The effect arises within hours and persists through the day. Market responses reflect the confirmation of intervention rather than surprise about its size, highlighting the role of credibility in FXI effectiveness.

Unlike conventional voltage balancing methods that rely on supply-side interventions, the proposed human-centric approach leverages the inherent flexibility of user-side loads across networked buildings to achieve a system-wide three-phase voltage balance, while respecting individual preferences. A mathematical model of user-side grid elements, including various classes of household appliances, energy storage systems (ESS), and distributed energy resources (DER) is developed, advancing the knowledge on how human consumption behaviors can be effectively integrated into power system operations. A novel three-phase dynamic pricing mechanism is designed to incentivize phase-specific consumption adjustments, encouraging users to adopt load patterns that contribute to a balanced three-phase voltage state without compromising comfort preferences. The proposed approach serves as a proof of concept for human-centric design in smart grids, operating entirely on the demand side while being robust, scalable, and privacy-preserving, with low computational complexity for users. Simulations illustrate that strategic load scheduling on each phase, driven by the proposed multi-agent model, significantly improves voltage balance, maintains customer comfort, and supports ancillary services such as peak shaving and frequency regulation."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u4e09\u76f8\u7535\u538b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7f13\u89e3\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u4e09\u76f8\u7535\u538b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u538b\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f9b\u7ed9\u4fa7\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4fa7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u7535\u538b\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u4e09\u76f8\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u6237\u4fa7\u7535\u7f51\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u76f8\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "findings": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7535\u538b\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8f85\u52a9\u670d\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5cf0\u503c\u524a\u51cf\u548c\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u8282\uff09\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7535\u538b\u5e73\u8861\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002"}}

However, existing EMT-based FS methods are often constrained by limitations such as homogeneous task generation relying on single filtering strategies and inadequate modeling of complex feature dependencies. Hence, a novel Evolutionary Multi-Task Feature Selection framework using Feature Association Graph (EMT-FAG) is proposed. Within this framework, three interrelated tasks are designed: one focusing on promising features, another exploring the entire feature space, and a third leveraging a dynamic feature association graph to capture and model complex feature interactions. A knowledge transfer mechanism is introduced, enabling efficient inter-task information sharing through particle swarm optimization, which improves optimization efficiency and mitigates premature convergence. This paper also proposes a dual-information fusion filtering method that comprehensively evaluates feature importance by integrating multiple metrics, providing a more robust and comprehensive evaluation framework for high-dimensional feature selection. The proposed framework is extensively validated through experiments on sixteen high-dimensional datasets, and the results demonstrate that EMT-FAG achieves similar or superior performance to state-of-the-art FS algorithms."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u56fe\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff08EMT-FAG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "research_question": "\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fdb\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u8fdb\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u56fe\u3001\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEMT-FAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u805a\u7126\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53cc\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "findings": "\u572816\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEMT-FAG\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Using firm-level microdata from three consecutive waves (2016\u20132018, 2018\u20132020, and 2020\u20132022) of the Turkish Community Innovation Survey (CIS), the analysis employs a three-stage structural modeling approach: (i) the firm\u2019s decision to engage in non-R&D innovation and the intensity of such investments, estimated using a generalized Tobit model; (ii) the conversion of these investments into non-technological innovation outputs, analyzed through an instrumented probit model; and (iii) the effect of these outputs on labor productivity, proxied by the logarithm of sales per employee. The results indicate a robust and statistically significant effect of non-R&D investment intensity on non-technological innovation outcomes, with particularly strong effects observed during the 2018\u20132020 period.

After controlling for experience, academic fields, and research productivity, a pay gap of 4.4% remains unexplained, suggesting potential discrimination.

We focus on the two most common types of auctions used for sovereign debt issuances: uniform and discriminatory price auctions. We calibrate the model to the Portuguese economy and find that the type of auction used has quantitative implications. In particular, discriminatory auctions generate spreads that provide a better fit to the data. In a counterfactual, we find that switching to a uniform protocol constitutes a Pareto improvement, and that the difference in welfare is highest during crises (0.6 percent of permanent consumption). Finally, we find that accounting for dynamic effects is crucial. In a single auction setting, a risk averse government prefers the discriminatory protocol.

The uncertain nature of this revenue calls for a robust fiscal framework to safeguard public finances. This paper proposes strengthening the national fiscal framework by establishing a prudent medium-term debt anchor and an expenditure rule to guide the annual budget process. We first establish a prudent debt anchor for Ireland by calibrating CIT shocks and simulating possible debt trajectories. Second, we propose an operational rule based on multi-year expenditure ceilings. The ceilings are calibrated such as to stabilize debt at the anchor level while accounting for the economy\u2019s cyclical position.

Moreover, rising average temperatures are expected to diminish productivity in agriculture, fisheries, and energy. Without efforts to strengthen its adaptive capacity, the country remains highly vulnerable to such acute and chronic physical risks in the long term. This paper combines a Markov-switching DSGE model with empirical estimates of losses from such risks to conduct a scenario analysis of their macro-fiscal implications.

Analyzing data from nine countries with notable MMF sectors post-pandemic, it examines three main drivers: yield differentials between MMFs and bank deposits, banking turmoils that affect perceptions of relative safety for traditional cash options, and structural characteristics (types) of MMFs. The findings indicate that MMFs attract capital during rising interest rates driven primarily by yield-seeking behavior. This pattern persisted following the 2023 banking turmoil, particularly in the U.S., where yield remained the dominant driver. After accounting for yield differentials, MMF growth was not unusually high compared to previous hiking cycles, suggesting limited evidence of widespread flight-to-safety flows. Moreover, when MMF yields rise, investors in the US and the euro area increasingly favor private debt MMFs, likely due to their higher yields. The study underscores the trade-off between safety and yield in investor behaviour, providing insights for policymakers on enhancing financial stability."}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u52a0\u606f\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u57fa\u91d1\uff08MMF\uff09\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u94f6\u884c\u52a8\u8361\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "research_question": "\u8d27\u5e01\u653f\u7b56\u52a0\u606f\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u57fa\u91d1\uff08MMF\uff09\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8MMF\u5728\u52a0\u606f\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "theoretical_framework": "\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67909\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u540e\u75ab\u60c5\u65f6\u671fMMF\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u94f6\u884c\u52a8\u8361\u548cMMF\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "findings": "MMF\u589e\u957f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u52a8\u8361\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u7f8e\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u9ad8\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u503a\u52a1MMF\u3002", "theory_contributions": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5728MMF\u589e\u957f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "practical_contributions": "\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}
