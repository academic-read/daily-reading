We constructed linear and non-linear ARDL models using data sets from 1985 to 2021. The idea was confirmed when both approaches were applied to the E-8 countries. Based on our research, countries GDP grows stably when it has natural resources, as opposed to the opposite effect of politically stable Syndrome (PIS). On the other hand, corruption raises GDP initially before decreasing it over time. GDP decreases when levels of corruption increase, and GDP grows in the opposite direction from the symmetric relationship that long-term statistics reveal among the two categories. The correlation between these findings and the proposed preparations indicates the need for a more open and honest national framework lacking of partiality.

I leverage the relationship between a home’s elevation and flooding during Hurricane Harvey, exploiting a discontinuous increase in damage from $0 to approximately $48,000 once water reaches the first floor of the structure. I provide novel evidence that disaster damage increases homeowner relocation while delaying property sales. The impacts on residential mobility attenuate over time, but I document a persistent divergence in the location and type of housing selected by damage-induced movers. My results indicate that flood damage makes people more likely to move shorter distances, and damage-induced movers are more likely to transition out of homeownership. Despite the combined shock to shelter and wealth, I find that flooded households are more likely to sort into higher-income census tracts. By evaluating the impact of direct household damage instead of neighborhood-level measures, this study provides new insights into how disaster damage affects residential choices."}}

The country launched a maritime logistics subsidy, the Sea-Toll Program (STP), for specific essential commodities, including food, connecting hub ports to geographically more isolated and economically disadvantaged regions. Using a unique household-level repeated cross-section and a triple differences model, the estimates, though modest in magnitude, suggest that the introduction of STP led to an increase in overall dietary intake, alongside gains in dietary diversity, and balance for households located near STP transit ports, with particularly significant effects on animal-sourced foods and processed foods. We provide suggestive evidence that the changes in staple food affordability partly explain this shift in dietary composition."}}

This paper proposes a novel Variational Bayesian Deep Reinforcement Learning (VB-DRL) framework that integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for latent representation learning, a Bayesian Actor-Critic policy with Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) optimization, and a Gaussian Process Temporal Difference (GPTD) module for uncertainty-aware reward estimation. The approach is tailored for high-dimensional investment environments where real-time adaptability, resilience, and probabilistic modeling are critical. By embedding Bayesian reasoning within the policy network and updating via Bayesian Gradient Descent (BGD), the framework captures posterior distributions over policy parameters, enabling robust exploration and reduced variance in policy gradients. Experimental results on a synthesized urban grid environment, informed by real-world infrastructure datasets, demonstrate superior performance in long-term return maximization, budget adherence, and investment resilience under stochastic disruptions. The model also provides a tractable measure of epistemic uncertainty, essential for policy interpretability and risk-sensitive decision-making. This work advances urban planning automation by offering a theoretically grounded, data-driven, and uncertainty-aware methodology that can be extended to smart city, energy grid, and transportation investment domains."}}

This paper proposes HookScope, a lifecycle-aware dynamic analysis framework for evaluating the structural security of programmable hooks. HookScope defines five runtime threat types (T1–T5) specific to the Uniswap V4 hook model and employs simulation-based testing to detect their manifestation during live contract execution. Risk scores are computed using a CVSS-inspired model that incorporates threat severity, execution context, and system-level impact. Comparative evaluation demonstrates that HookScope identifies threats overlooked by static tools such as Mythril, highlighting the necessity of lifecycle-aware dynamic analysis for programmable DeFi infrastructure. The proposed framework contributes a reproducible, quantifiable approach to threat detection in decentralized protocols and provides a foundation for future research on secure extensibility in AMM-based systems."}}

We construct and compare three typical classification frameworks for measuring SHI: an agronomic scoring system grounded in regenerative principles, a threshold-based rule classification, and an unsupervised cluster analysis. We then estimate the relationship between profitability and SHI using Ordinary Least Squares. Only a high-ranking agronomic score shows a consistent and statistically significant positive association with profitability. Farms scoring high under this method saw a 5.6 percentage point higher net farm income ratio on average. Expert-informed, context-sensitive approaches to measuring SHI are more predictive of financial performance than purely rule- or data-driven alternatives. Substantial disagreement between classification methods—only 10% of farms were consistently ranked high across all three—underscores the methodological challenge in quantifying SHI intensity. These inconsistencies have implications for research, as well as policy and incentive design, particularly where SHI definitions determine access to subsidies or market benefits."}}

Corrosion poses significant risks to pipeline safety and economic efficiency, making effective in-line inspections and robust maintenance strategies essential. Given the inherent randomness in corrosion progression, the variability in pipeline defects, and the complexity of pipeline system structures, this study develops a novel optimization framework that integrates Bayesian theory with a heuristic genetic algorithm. First, an enhanced Bayesian updating approach is utilized to refine the parameters of corrosion degradation models, thereby reducing uncertainty and improving the prediction accuracy of corrosion progression. Based on the refined corrosion model, a genetic algorithm specifically tailored for pipeline maintenance optimization is proposed, including customized encoding and mutation rules to achieve rapid convergence and effectively avoid local optima. Through iterative application, the developed framework dynamically updates maintenance strategies using real-time in-line inspection data, thus reducing maintenance costs while ensuring pipeline system reliability. Results from applying the proposed method to long-term pipeline management scenarios demonstrate a significant improvement in both the economic efficiency and reliability of energy transportation systems."}}

Understanding these underlying factors is essential for designing effective strategies to promote sustainable agricultural practices, particularly in light of the relatively low uptake of such practices.OBJECTIVEThis study examines how farmer goals and values influence decision-making and shape Polish and German potato farmers&apos; preferences for sustainable crop protection.METHODSAn integrated choice and latent variable framework that combines structural equation modeling with a discrete choice experiment was employed to jointly estimate farmer preferences and the underlying motivational constructs.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings reveal a nuanced interplay between socio-economic factors and latent motivations. While organic production is positively associated with social and intrinsic values, it is negatively associated with instrumental motivations in both countries, emphasizing the role of non-economic drivers in sustainable farming choices. Farmers driven by intrinsic values prefer practices that substantially reduce pesticide residues and prefer shorter transition periods, whereas those motivated by instrumental values exhibit resistance to such changes due to economic concerns. Farmers exhibiting social motivations favor integrated pest management practices with demonstrable environmental benefits and emphasize the role of advisory support in their decision-making. Further, analysis reveals both convergence and divergence in information-seeking behavior across farmer classes, reflecting shared use of information sources despite differing motivations and how underlying goals shape both the choice and use of information sources. SIGNIFICANCEThese insights underscore the importance of aligning policy tools with diverse farmers&apos; goals and values. Tailoring strategies to accommodate these differences can foster more inclusive, targeted, and effective national efforts to scale up the adoption of sustainable crop protection practices."}}

In our model, utility-maximising entrepreneurs optimally choose how much to invest in safe government bonds and risky capital production, as well as which percentage of their income to evade. If evasion is audited, a fine must be paid. The government funds non-productive spending through income taxes and debt. Evasion enables entrepreneurs to accumulate more capital, thereby reducing their need to save for unexpected events. In equilibrium, fewer savings mean fewer investments. This lowers economic growth and increases the cost of borrowing for the government, ultimately raising the debt-to-GDP ratio. Nevertheless, when we compare a reduction in the tax burden achieved through a higher tolerance for tax evasion with a reduction in the legal tax, we show that the first strategy leads to a smaller increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio. This is because, unlike tax evasion, legal tax cuts directly increase the return on capital investments, thereby raising the government&apos;s borrowing costs in equilibrium."}}

It has spread to almost every subfield in the computer science literature, as well as economics and finance. Especially in a world where digital trust is much sought for, blockchains offer a rich variety of desired properties, such as immutability, public auditing, decentralised record keeping, among others. Not only has it been a research topic of its own, the integration of blockchains into other systems has been proposed as solutions in many areas, ranging from grid computing, cloud and fog computing, to internet of things, self driving vehicles , and smart cities. In many cases the primary function attributed to blockchains in these contexts is resource management. Although much attention is paid to this topic, the focus is on single resource allocation scenarios. Even the cases where multiple resource types are to be allocated, are treated as single resource type scenarios, and problems are formulated as allocating standardised bundles consisting of a fixed amount of each of them, such as virtual machines. From a global point of view, this leads to resource waste, since some resources are left idle by the tasks which do not need them, and to which they are allocated along with the resources it needs. The present study addresses the problem of allocating multiple resource types among tasks with heterogeneous resource demands with a smart contract adaptation of Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness; an algorithm that approximates Dominant Resource Fairness, without loop iterations, which makes it preferable in the blockchain context because of the block gas limit. We present the resulting algorithm, Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness, along with the empirical data collected from the tests run on the algorithm. The results show that Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness is a gas-cost efficient algorithm, which can be used to manage hundreds of resource types for unlimited number of users."}}

Certain immigrant groups, such as women and those in low-skilled jobs, were more likely to relocate to areas with an increased presence of native veterans.

Firstly, considering the source-load forecast uncertainty, the day-ahead interval dispatch model with multi-objective, and an intra-day dual-layer dispatch model with stability requirements are respectively constructed. Secondly, a collaborative dispatch strategy that combines the model predictive control and conventional dispatch methods is designed to solve the intraday dispatch model with interval variables. Then, based on the deviation in dispatch results between the day-ahead and the slowlayer, we present an adaptive switching criterion between the slow layer and fast layer. Finally, the cumulative deviation of dispatch results between the slow layer and the day-ahead within one hour is calculated, and a day-ahead redispatch strategy with the intra-day dispatch results feedback is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the dispatch cost and improve dispatch reliability."}}

This study provides a detailed analysis of load shifting strategies and their impacts on cost savings and grid load. The TES unit is integrated with the HP system via a secondary loop, allowing cooling energy to be stored in phase change material (PCM) and heat transfer fluid (HTF) within the TES unit. The stored energy can later be discharged to provide cooling to the building, decoupling cooling generation from demand and enabling flexible operation. A field study is conducted to compare the TES-HP system with the nonTES-HP system, demonstrating the benefits of integrating TES. An evaluation matrix is proposed, including instantaneous performance, load-shifting performance, accumulated performance, unit-value indexes from both building and equipment perspectives, and peak-hour-only indexes, to comprehensively assess and compare the performance of the TES-HP and non-TES-HP systems. A rule-based control strategy, which considers variations in electricity prices and ambient temperature, is implemented to stabilize building thermal comfort, increase TES charging efficiency, and achieve load shifting. To further supplement the field study, simulation models are developed to analyze the impact of TES cooling storage capacity and heat transfer capability (UA, between the HTF and PCM in the TES unit) on load-shifting performance. Field test results indicate that, with the same thermostat setting, the TES-HP system can achieve hourly grid load reductions of 92%, 58%, and 36% during each peak hour, respectively, and a 39% reduction in 24-hour electricity costs compared to the non-TES-HP system. Isolating the effects of different cooling loads, TES-HP can increase cooling capacity per cost (QpC) by 6.6 times during the first peak hour and by 27% over the entire 24-hour field study period. Simulation results indicate that doubling the storage capacity of TES can reduce hourly cost and power consumption by up to 84.8% during peak hours and reduce 24-hour electricity costs by 38% compared with the original TES unit design. Increasing UA by 10 times can lead to a more than 25% reduction in 24-hour electricity costs, owing to improved system efficiency.

This study evaluates the performance of various ML models, ranging from linear and lasso regression to advanced approaches such as support vector regression, random forests, and a deep learning model (LSTM), for GWT prediction across six sites in Austria, each representing distinct hydroclimatic regimes. Three feature sets were analyzed: (i) time parameters only, (ii) climate parameters only, and (iii) integrated time and climate parameters. A generalized additive model using only time features served as the baseline, while LSTM incorporated sequential time and climate features to predict GWT and identify characteristic time lags of climate variables. The results reveal that regular seasonal variations and long-term trends provide robust diagnostics for selecting optimal prediction strategies. Simpler models perform well in highly regular regimes, whereas complex ML models are necessary for irregular GWT patterns. Integrating time and climate features significantly outperforms climate-only models, achieving up to an 81% increase in R² and a 52% error reduction. Stepwise backward selection (SBS) and principal component analysis (PCA) yield comparable performance, but SBS preserves physical interpretability, identifying monthly radiation and air temperature as key predictors. These findings highlight the importance of site-specific strategies for GWT prediction, combining hydro-climatic diagnostics with tailored ML models to account for local seasonal and trend behaviors. This study establishes a foundation for accurate GWT predictions across diverse locations, supporting improved groundwater management in the face of climate variability."}}

This problem is of significant practical relevance in rail traffic management and it is a special case of the Train Routing Selection Problem. We introduce a Binary Quadratic Programming formulation for the TSRSP and apply a linearization technique from the literature that requires a linear number of additional variables and constraints. This yields a novel and effective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for the TSRSP. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we further propose a method to strengthen the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation of the MILP formulation, substantially improving its computational performance. The resulting formulation is the first to efficiently solve real-world TSRSP instances to optimality within short computational times—instances that, until now, have only been addressed using heuristic approaches in the literature. Extensive computational results show that our MILP model consistently outperforms existing formulations, both in terms of computational time and the number of instances solved to optimality, primarily due to the strength of its LP relaxation."}}

The wider adoption of electric tractors faces the challenge of lacking infrastructure solutions for high-power electric tractors operating across vast, seasonal farmlands. The battery swapping stations equipped with standardized and “Lego-like” battery cells meet the high-volume charging demands and reduce downtime compared to conventional charging. To support the future infrastructure requirements of heavy-duty electric tractors, this paper addresses a critical gap in agricultural electrification by proposing a location selection and capacity configuration model for battery swapping stations and demonstrates its feasibility in a real-world scenario. By analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of the charging demand across multi-regional farmlands under a fully electrified scenario, the optimal deployment location for installing the battery swapping station is determined. Then, the capacity configuration model optimizes the number of charging bays and battery cells to minimize the annual investment cost. The case study validates the effectiveness of the deployment location selection and capacity configuration models."}}

The parameters in the CTM are calibrated by using a set of video recordings and reproducing the arching phenomenon of passengers. To optimize carriage parking schemes, a swarm intelligence-based heuristic algorithm is proposed, where the CTM is embedded into the evaluation process to dynamically assess passenger moving efficiency during each iteration. We conduct a set of numerical experiments to evaluate the effect of algorithm parameters on algorithm performance and the influence of passenger behaviors on passenger waiting times. The results demonstrate that the algorithm can further optimize a theoretically optimal solution obtained when the movement behaviors and interactions of passengers are not considered. Additionally, overall system efficiency is maximized when the frequency of carriage re-selection behavior of passengers is maintained at a moderate level. Moreover, it is essential to deliberately designate carriages for passengers so as to improve the travel efficiency of passengers in the DANRT system."}}

Following a sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach, the study began with 24 semi-structured interviews analyzed using Glaser’s grounded theory to extract foundational themes. These insights informed the initial design of a measurement instrument, which was subsequently refined using Fuzzy Delphi, statistically validated via Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and structurally analyzed through Fuzzy DEMATEL and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). The findings reveal two overarching dimensions—deficiencies in work-related and non-work-related relationships—encompassing nine subdimensions and thirty validated indicators. Structural modeling indicates that perceived deficits in legitimacy, professional support, and formal recognition act as foundational causal factors, exacerbating other relational deficiencies. This study contributes both theoretically and practically by clarifying the structure of managerial loneliness, providing a reliable tool for its assessment, and illuminating the internal mechanisms that intensify managerial loneliness in organizational contexts."}}

Based on China&apos;s smart grid industry cooperation patents from 2016 to 2021, this paper uses social network analysis method to build collaborative innovation network, describes the connotation of network robustness optimization, and puts forward the idea of network robustness optimization. Simulation analysis is used to optimize the network robustness from the perspective of network subject heterogeneity. Then, based on the heterogeneity of network subjects, the network robustness is optimized and simulated from the perspective of multidimensional proximity. It is found that the network robustness optimization based on subject heterogeneity is better than the existing network on the whole, and the connection between large and small nodes makes the network robustness optimal. The network robustness optimization based on subject heterogeneity and multidimensional proximity is better than the existing network and the optimized network of large-small node connections. Among them, the optimized network of large-small node connections that are geographically and organizationally not close to each other has the best robustness in face of random or deliberate failure of nodes and edge. Based on this, this paper proposes countermeasures and suggestions for network robustness optimization from the aspects of promoting cooperation among strong-weak, cross-regional and different organization types of innovation subjects."}}

Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile, most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end framework that reformulates the task as joint localization and geometric regression. A Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and ∼14ms inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications.

This work presents an anomaly detection framework for real-time defect monitoring using a custom-designed wireless antenna sensor. The sensor consists of an aluminum split-ring resonator patterned with gold conductive ink and mounted on a ceramic substrate. It passively responds to structural and thermal changes during the manufacturing process by producing frequency-domain scattering parameter signals. To process these high-dimensional signals without requiring defect labeled data, we develop a zero-bias deep neural network trained exclusively on normal-class samples. The model constructs a class-structured latent space using cosine similarity to learned templates and applies Mahalanobis distance to define statistical decision boundaries. Anomalies are identified when inputs deviate significantly from the expected distribution of normal data. The framework is designed around three deployment-oriented principles. Grounding ensures that model outputs can be interpreted in terms of meaningful spectral features. Instructibility allows users to tune detection sensitivity through threshold control without retraining. Alignment guarantees that the internal decision logic is consistent with process tolerances and quality objectives in manufacturing. The system is evaluated using experimental data collected from the antenna sensor under controlled thermal variation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects anomalous signal patterns without using defect supervision, while maintaining interpretability and user control. This approach offers a transparent, adaptive, and data-efficient solution for in situ defect monitoring in additive manufacturing environments."}}

To improve their sustainability and performance when demand is foreseen to increase, we envision simulators will become primary decision-making tools.

Addressing this challenge, in this work we propose M3SA, a datacenter simulation and analysis framework that uses discrete-event simulation to predict, per model and then combined into a meta-model, the impact on climate and performance of various realistic datacenter conditions. We design an architecture for simulating multiple concurrent models, a technique to integrate the results of multiple models into a meta-model, and a procedure to evaluate the accuracy of the meta-model. Through experiments with a prototype, we show that (i) M3SA can be used to reproduce peer-reviewed experiments, and enhance their output with more diverse metrics and more detailed analysis; (ii) M3SA can be configured with a variety of realistic parameters, such as diverse workload traces (using Grid Workloads Archive data in our experiments), and energy production data such as carbon intensity over time and location (gCO2/kWh data across all EU regions, from ENTSO-E); (iii) M3SA enables various types of what-if and how-to analysis, such as how to configure CO2-aware migration over yearly energy-production patterns.

To analyze the risk performance of multi-state systems under the mapping of ship combination features, this study proposes a system multi-state analysis framework integrating Random Forest (RF) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) models. First, based on the complex network characteristics of multi-state system components, the Euclidean distance is used to construct a dual-layer network of the MTS reflecting ship feature relationships. Second, the RF algorithm is introduced to build a ship feature importance analysis model, and GAT is applied to analyze the risk performance of MSS under the path of ship component networks. Finally, the proposed method is verified by simulation using the gas carrier safety inspection data from the Tokyo Memorandum(T-MOU). The data-driven results show that the state of the MTS from system components has significant correlations with external conditions such as ship age, gross tonnage, flag state, and classification society, presenting behavioral symptoms dominated by operation and maintenance state, with alternating influences of inherent and emergency status. The proposed risk performance analysis framework provides a novel perspective for describing multi-state risk of MTS, helping to analyze how changes in one subsystem propagate through the network and affect other subsystems through shared feature patterns and path dependence."}}

Our approach is cognizant of current and future performance, maintenance, and economic aspects of the supervised system and its operational environment. Regardless of their energy generation modality (e.g., fossil, nuclear), the relatively-centralized systems that will complement distributed renewable energy in contemporary power grids will not only be subject to the complexity and typical operational, maintenance, and economic nuances of any complex production facility, but also be based on comparatively new technologies that yet need to prove competitive in increasingly tighter markets. The manner any production facility is run can have a profound effect on its operational and maintenance costs, whereas the multi-party bidding and market dynamics existing in contemporary energy markets largely dictate the operational envelopes and accrued costs for the entire facility. Our methodology establishes a long-horizon-aware intelligent feedback loop that bids strategically in day-ahead energy markets and supervises other operations and maintenance aspects (e.g., maintenance action selection and scheduling, slowdown or downtime considerations) in way that maximizes plant profitability by increasing revenues while controlling and distributing maintenance costs. The foundations of our approach are based not only on RL techniques to periodically (re-)construct stochastic, strongly-coupled bidding and plant supervision policies with receding reasoning horizons, but also on operationally-leaning learning and inference RL workflows. In addition to establishing the interfaces and mechanics of our RL agent, we prototype key aspects of the underlying techno-economic environment and relevant algorithmic and numerical tools and approximations that enable the sought-after reasoning. In contrast to isolated bidding algorithms operating under the premise of statistically- or offline-computed marginal costs disconnected from actual, day-to-day operations in the particular operational environment, our techniques learn to address the coupled problem of bidding and plant supervision holistically, within any particular operational environment defined by the local energy grid and market, as well as in view of their probabilistic behavior and future evolution."}}

However, linear BESS optimization models for energy trading are often based on simplified assumptions, such as fixed component efficiencies. These simplifications fail to capture crucial operational constraints and result in discrepancies between scheduled and actual state of charge (SOC), leading to unfulfilled power delivery and financial penalties. This study addresses this gap by using field data from a real BESS to parametrize linear load-dependent efficiency models for inverters and transformers. Furthermore, the models are validated in the field by assessing their accuracy in calculating power delivery. This includes accounting for component efficiencies and SOC dynamics and comparing the results to a reference test. The data-driven parametrization presented in this study achieved a reduction of 78.2% in unfulfilled energy delivery and a 71.7% reduction in balancing energy costs caused by deviations compared to the reference test. It also significantly decreased the BESS round-trip efficiency deviation between modeled and measured values, with a 4.2 percentage point improvement over the reference test. The linear inverter model achieved a deviation from the actual measured round-trip efficiency of only 0.55 percentage points. These findings highlight the importance of accurate efficiency modeling in minimizing SOC deviations and fulfilling planned schedules in energy trading applications. Finally, this work proposes a methodology that is broadly applicable not only for energy trading with BESS, but also for ancillary services and multi-use operation."}}

This paper presents a novel software architecture for agent-based emotional persuasion in bilateral negotiations. Each agent is endowed with an OCEAN personality profile, and its round-by-round emotional state is generated via a hierarchical mapping from personality traits through the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) state to discrete emotion categories. To capture the inherent uncertainty between emotion and persuasive behavior, an emotional preference membership function is introduced to quantify how an agent’s emotional state probabilistically influences its choice of persuasive strategy. The Cumulative Prospect Theory then transforms these preferences into concrete offers and counter-offers. The proposed architecture is validated with extensive simulation experiments in industrial purchasing scenarios. Compared to emotion-blind baselines, the constructed emotionally intelligent agents achieve significantly higher negotiation success rates, require fewer rounds to reach agreement, and deliver greater joint utility—while maintaining equitable utility distribution between parties. Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art models further demonstrate the proposed architecture’s ability to accelerate consensus and improve negotiated outcomes. This work lays a robust foundation for deploying emotionally aware negotiation agents in real-world industrial systems."}}

The most prominent objection concerns the reliability and extrapolation capabilities of model parameters under varying operating conditions. To address these concerns, we evaluated the uncertainty propagation from estimated parameters onto the outputs of our column model (introduced in previous work) and assessed parameter identifiability through an ill-conditioning analysis. Additionally, we examined parameter extrapolation capabilities by conducting parameter estimation (PE) based on fluid dynamic experiments while validating the model outputs with mass transfer experiments. The PE was performed using the maximum likelihood approach with our own experiments conducted in a DN50 pulsed sieve tray extraction column. We selected the parameters d_stab,d_100, and the swarm exponent n for PE as they immanently impact the drop diameter d and hold-up α_y, i.e., properties measurable online in our experimental setup. Incorporating the estimated parameters, the column model demonstrated good agreement (e_rel<10 %) on key fluid dynamic properties such as d, α_y, and both stationary and transient concentration profiles in the mass transfer experiments. As a prospective operation optimization task, we utilized our column model to determine the minimal solvent demand to extract 99% of the product for two column experiments. The final uncertainty analysis demonstrated robustness of the parameter estimates by yielding coefficients of variation < 4% for d and α_y , while achieving even smaller values in the concentration profiles and for the minimal solvent demand."}}

A novel AI-based XR training system that enables real-time knowledge capture from expert users is presented. This system allows trainers to author training procedures directly in an XR scenario, making the development of XR training systems as intuitive as instructing a novice worker. An AI-powered Digital Assistant (AIDA) supports this process by collecting, organizing, and delivering context-specific information to users during task execution, while full-body motion capture tracks postures and interactions. The training experience is made directly accessible to inexperienced workers through an XR-based training system supported by AIDA. The system was tested in two case studies with participants of varying expertise levels. Following the Kirkpatrick model of training evaluation, the solution was assessed considering the Reaction and Learning levels. Results show high usability, low cognitive load, and positive user engagement. The second case study also demonstrated strong learning outcomes. Overall, the system proves to be a flexible and effective approach to training, leveraging XR and AI to bridge skill gaps and update the approach to training in industrial settings."}}

The study uses a cross-sectional quantitative survey of 380 tourism entrepreneurs from five regions and applies the DEE framework through its operational components: digital infrastructure, platforms, skills, institutional support, sociocultural networks, and digital finance. Regression analysis suggests that entrepreneurship performance is driven by digital platforms, infrastructure, and skills. Both institutional support and financial mechanisms display positive, albeit weaker, impacts. Moderation analysis also shows that the relationships are impacted by firm size, entrepreneurial experience, and technological readiness. Collectively, these results support the validity of the DEE model in resource-constrained settings and expose underlined structural inequities and systemic gaps within the ecosystem.The research expands the DEE framework into the context of the service industry within emerging economies and offers practical guidance for policymakers. Key suggestions are addressing equity gaps in infrastructure, advancing strategic digital capacity-building initiatives, and improving coherence among overarching policies.

This study presents a novel ​Multi-Task Learning Groundwater Model (MTLGW)​​, which integrates time-series decomposition (STL) with LSTM/GRU neural networks to reconstruct regional-scale groundwater levels across the North China Plain (NCP), including data-scarce regions. Using 559 monitoring wells (2005–2018) and GLDAS-CLSM datasets, MTLGW achieves robust performance, with an ​average R² of 0.63​ (median: 0.64) across the NCP. The model demonstrates strong transferability, achieving a test R² of 0.48 in regions with limited observations. Key predictors such as 40-month lagged autocorrelation and Continuous Wavelet Transform coefficients (scale = 20) significantly enhance model accuracy. Spatial performance varies with higher accuracy in agricultural zones (R² = 0.50) compared to urban areas (R² = 0.47), likely due to complex anthropogenic influences. MTLGW also reconstructs shallow groundwater storage changes in the NCP comparing them to GLDAS estimates.  Results show that the South-to-North Water (SNWT) markedly alleviated groundwater storage depletion across the NCP. For example, Beijing experienced recovery (+48 mm/year), while the decline in Henan slowed (−30 mm/year). These findings highlight GLDAS’s underestimation of human interventions such as SNWT and underscore MTLGW’s strength in capturing anthropogenic impacts. By integrating multi-task learning with time-series decomposition, MTLGW advances regional-scale groundwater modeling and offers a scalable framework for data-limited basins worldwide, helping bridge the gaps between AI-based predictions and sustainable groundwater management."}}

This study aims to provide a theoretical rationale that sheds light on these processes from the perspectives of leaders and employees, using two distinct theories: the attraction-selection-attrition model and the theory of embeddedness. Drawing on the attraction-selection-attrition model, it seeks to examine the role of leaders who leverage their position of authority to attract and retain employees who share their values, including those that may be unethical. This creates a culture that reinforces the leaders&apos; power and allows unethical values to become established. However, the study also recognizes that the leaders only partially determine employees&apos; responses to such values. Instead, their personal dispositions and values also play a crucial role in determining their level of acceptance and internalization of the unethical culture. As the culture becomes established, employees may engage in the process of embeddedness, which involves a combination of link, fit, and sacrifice and institutionalize the culture. The study highlights the importance of considering the interplay between leaders, employees, and their environments in shaping an organization&apos;s culture. By providing a comprehensive theoretical framework, the study contributes to our understanding of the complex and dynamic processes involved in establishing and institutionalizing an unethical culture. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the need for organizations to take proactive steps to build more ethical and sustainable cultures."}}

These systems involve three primary aspects of decision-making: rack-to-AGV assignment, AGV path planning, and conflict mediation for multiple AGVs. While substantial research has been dedicated to these elements in isolation, comprehensive integrated studies addressing the problem holistically are still relatively few. This study introduces a co-optimization problem for task assignment and global path planning for multiple AGVs in RMFS, effectively integrating dispatching, conflict-free routing, and scheduling of these vehicles. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, aimed at minimizing the total operational time of AGVs and the maximum picking completion time. Given that the problem is NP-hard, efficiently solving the MILP model for realistic-scale instances presents significant challenges. To address this issue, we developed a two-echelon K-Means and an enhanced conflict-based search algorithm. This approach allocates racks to AGVs using the K-Means algorithm while planning conflict-free paths for AGVs through an enhanced conflict-based search method. Furthermore, we rigorously analyze key structural properties of the problem, revealing several theoretically grounded properties embedded within the algorithm&apos;s logic. To ensure high-quality lower bounds, we propose a relaxation model that does not involve planning paths for AGVs. Our experimental results indicate that: (i) our algorithm achieves solutions with minimal optimality gaps compared to the high-quality lower bounds developed; (ii) it outperforms existing benchmark algorithms in terms of solution quality and demonstrates superior computational efficiency; and (iii) the proposed properties significantly enhance the algorithm&apos;s performance. In conclusion, this paper presents a robust and tailored approach to RMFS, providing valuable managerial insights to empower warehouse operators in their decision-making processes."}}

Although existing literature has emphasized the role of perceived risk in influencing consumer behavior, limited attention has been paid to how different perceived risk dimensions, along with individual factors, shape OPI. This study aims to explore the impact of perceived risk on OPI and investigates how profession, personality traits, and past experience moderate this relationship in a collectivist cultural context.Design/methodology/approachThis quantitative, cross-sectional study is based on survey data collected from 500 Pakistani consumers. Standardized instruments adapted from Ariffin et al. (2018) were used to measure six perceived risk dimensions. Ordinary least squares regression and moderation analysis were conducted using SPSS PROCESS Model 1. Moderators included profession (Venkatesh et al., 2020), personality traits (Soto & John, 2017), and past experience (Kim & Lee, 2022).FindingsThe findings reveal that among the risk dimensions, only social risk significantly influences online purchase intention (β = 0.046, p = 0.036), reflecting the role of societal influence in Pakistan’s collectivist society. Moderation analysis shows significant interaction effects (R2 = 0.03–0.05, β = -0.15 to -0.22, p < 0.01), indicating that profession, personality traits, and past experience strengthen the negative impact of perceived risk on OPI.Research implicationsThe study enriches the existing literature by identifying how contextual and individual-level moderators affect perceived risk in online shopping, thereby suggesting a nuanced understanding of consumer decision making in emerging economies.Practical implicationsThese findings have practical value for digital marketers aiming to develop more effective strategies. Targeted interventions, such as influencer-driven content and AI-based personalization, may help mitigate perceived risks and encourage consumer engagement in e-commerce.OriginalityThis paper uniquely integrates risk perception with individual differences in a culturally specific context, providing fresh insights into consumer resistance in online shopping."}}

Accordingly, the reliability of SSDs has become critical, and timely failure detection is essential to maintain data availability and system resilience. However, existing storage systems do not detect and notify of SSD failures promptly, resulting in prolonged service downtime and increased risk of data loss. By analyzing local and distributed storage systems, we identify three primary causes of delayed SSD failure detection: 1) loose-deterministic failure check, 2) fixed command timeout, and 3) delayed failure notification. First, the Linux kernel employs a loose-deterministic failure check based on timeouts, which is a passive failure detection mechanism. As a result, SSD failure checks can be delayed, potentially resulting in untimely or inaccurate detection. Second, the kernel uses a fixed timeout that fails to accommodate differences across SSD models and command types. Third, intermediate layers between the device driver and applications, such as RAID, file systems, and network layers, introduce further delays in failure notification due to their own failure-handling policies. To address these issues, in this article, we propose RL-Watchdog (RLW), which accelerates SSD failure detection in both local and distributed storage systems through four key components: light-weighted watchdog (LWW), reinforcement learning-based timeout predictor (RLTP), fast failure notification (FFN), and extended FFN (eFFN). First, LWW periodically checks SSD liveness using a light-weight special command to ensure deterministic failure detection. Second, RLTP dynamically predicts command latency based on SSD states, adapting to different SSD models and command types. Third, FFN bypasses intermediate layers and directly notifies the application layer of SSD failure, ensuring rapid failure notification. Finally, for the distributed storage system, eFFN promptly delivers SSD failure notifications from storage nodes across the network, reducing failure detection time and minimizing data loss at the application level on client nodes. We implement RLW in the Linux kernel and evaluate it in both single-node and multi-node environments. The results imply that RLW reduces data loss by up to 96.7% in single-node environments and 44.6% in multi-node environments."}}

These perspectives (scales, conditions, behaviour, and dependencies) form the basis of a developed framework that addresses the upfront consideration of input materials for system analysis in view of their requirements, as well as the design of a data structure that facilitates incorporation of multiple concepts. Three nautical cases demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world systems. The derived data structure links system-level patterns and performance to detail-level processes and underlying data, and it enables directly complementing outcomes based on one perspective with those of other perspectives, improving integrated views on the system.

This study examines how platform-based NFT features, such as scarcity, ownership, interoperability, price, and perceived value, are interpreted differently across identity-based user segments. We adopt a mixed-methods design to uncover preference heterogeneity and symbolic logic in NFT evaluation. Study 1 employs a D-optimal conjoint analysis to quantify the relative importance of NFT attributes in user decision-making. Study 2 applies identity-contingent regression modeling to examine how consumers’ identity orientations (e.g., investor, expressive user, creator) moderate the interpretation of these attributes. Results reveal that attributes like scarcity or ownership function not as static affordances but as identity-sensitive value signals-e.g., signaling exclusivity, legitimacy, or alienation depending on the user type. These findings contribute to digital commerce analytics by demonstrating how symbolic meaning is co-constructed through attribute-based choices and mediated by consumer identity regimes. Practically, the results offer a segmentation framework for NFT platform designers to align product features with divergent value logics. The research advances the field of data-driven consumer modeling by integrating conjoint-based preference elicitation with identity-contingent interpretation in the context of digitally mediated markets."}}

In this study, we developed an optimization-based techno-economic framework that determines the optimal capacity for waste heat utilization and evaluates the associated costs for various end-uses. We demonstrate the framework by assessing optimal integration pathways for direct air capture with industrial natural gas boilers by recovering waste heat from flue gases, while accounting for various DAC configurations, flue-gas conditions, and fuel-specific constraints. Our results highlight that replacing heat pumps with industrial waste heat reduces costs, enabling tens-of-kilotonne-scale DAC plants available today to match the cost levels projected for future million-tonne facilities, thereby accelerating large-scale deployment. When cost minimization is the primary objective, integrating DAC with waste heat extracted from flue gas at 200-800 °C can reduce CO2 removal costs by 12-22% relative to standalone million-tonne DAC plants. Conversely, if the goal is to maximize removal, harnessing waste heat from a single boiler could support removal of up to 140 ktCO2/y without incurring additional cost. Ultimately, the economic viability and scalability of waste-heat-integrated DAC depend on DAC technology maturity, site-specific flue-gas characteristics, and whether deployment strategies prioritize minimizing cost or maximizing removal capacity."}}

A random forest regression (RFR) model is trained on experimental CO2 solubility data for a monoethanolamine-potassium lysinate (MEA-PL) and pure potassium lysinate (PL) solutions across a range of temperatures and CO2 partial pressures. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, achieving an R2 value of 0.96 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.04, effectively capturing the nonlinear thermodynamic relationships governing solubility. By eliminating the need for extensive, costly, and potentially hazardous experimental measurements, this framework enables rapid performance evaluation. The predicted solubility values are subsequently integrated into an LCA model to quantify the global warming potential of each aqueous solution system under scenarios with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS). From the analysis, CCS implementation reduced annual CO2 emissions from 1933.3 to 226.3 Gg CO2-eq per year, a mitigation of over 88%. This work constitutes the first demonstration of an integrated ML-LCA approach for solvent screening, offering a scalable, data-driven, and cost-effective methodology for advancing carbon capture technologies."}}

Results show that condensate recovery improved from 35.64% without injection to a peak of 37.90% at 80 MSCFD injection. The reservoir also demonstrated excellent CO2 retention, with storage efficiencies exceeding 96% in all scenarios. Despite these technical benefits, economic analysis indicates that none of the tested injection rates were profitable at current market conditions (condensate price $70/bbl, CO2 injection cost $1.5/MSCF).

Traditional classification models, typically designed for static datasets, are inherently limited in addressing the dynamic nature of streaming data, where overlapping class regions and evolving distributions hinder the maintenance of discriminative decision boundaries. In this paper, we propose a novel deep metric learning framework specifically tailored to address the challenges of class overlap in high-dimensional data streams. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, we develop a multi-anchor sample mining mechanism based on neighborhood rough set theory, which partitions the data into non-overlapping and overlapping regions. By utilizing region-specific triplet-margin losses and hinge embedding loss, we construct a more fine-grained discriminative metric space that significantly enhances the separation of overlapping classes. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic, density-aware real-time label propagation mechanism with class-imbalance compensation. This component integrates real-time distribution estimation with a nonlinear adaptive threshold controller, enabling dual adaptivity: (1) dynamically re-weighting density contributions via inverse-frequency scaling to mitigate the dominance of majority classes and (2) adjusting threshold boundaries for frequent classes while relaxing propagation criteria for rare classes through nonlinear adjustments. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that our method not only improves balanced accuracy but also enhances robustness in the presence of class overlap and class imbalance, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques."}}

Against its potential to cope with liquidity problems in old age, it has not been much used in practice. The literature is inconclusive about possible motivations for this, which include bequest motives, limited understanding of the product, financial education and mistrust in financial institutions. To test for barriers to the use of RM, we exploit data from an original comprehensive qualitative and quantitative research study conducted between May and September 2024 in Italy, a country with a pronounced population ageing, a high home ownership rate and a traditional family structure. In order to assess who and why is still afraid of RMs, we test four hypotheses supported by household decision models by means of regression analysis. Two are our main results. First, contrary to theoretical expectations and the previous literature, bequest motives do not hinder interest in the RM, which in contrast is higher for homeowners with the present need to support grandchildren. Second, two are the most significant factors behind the lack of interest: low levels of financial education reflecting limited understanding of the product and its potential to address liquidity needs, and distrust in financial institutions. These results have relevant implications since they highlight the need for coordinated industry and policy efforts in improving targeted financial education initiatives, product transparency and trust in financial institutions as they are crucial conditions to increase the RM unexpressed potential."}}

The dynamic characteristics of the three-dimensional discrete system are analyzed, including stability region, strange attractors and maximum Lyapunov exponent. It is found that: (1) moderate price adjustments contribute more effectively to the long-term stability of the automobile market., and the stability region is the result of nonlinear coupling of the three; (2) lower switching costs among automobile manufacturers can intensify market competition; (3) BEV manufacturers exhibit more stable pricing, indicating stronger market stability and guidance capability; transforming manufacturers have steadier profits and stronger risk resistance, with PHEV pricing playing a key role in enhancing their competitiveness; (4) the dual credit policy is more effective in regulating the market than the carbon tax policy, and this paper further identifies the \"safe bottom line\" of credit trading price for any level of carbon tax; (5) the composite control method of delayed feedback and state feedback is more effective for the control of the system."}}

Due to the existence of three heterogeneous sources of heterogeneity among creditfinanced entrepreneurs (two of which pertinent to green loan covenants), there exists novel between-variety substitution and disciplinary-preemptive effects. Evaluated using fixed-effect regressions on 74 economies during the 2004-21 periods, we find a more prudent conventional LTV regime is associated with more (less) green innovation (greenwashing), but there isn’t a supporting case for green differentiated LTV. In addition, the short-term negative growth effect from green transition would need to be mitigated by the capital adequacy regime, which exhibits direct growth-enhancing properties.

The empirical strategy isolates the stock price response to weekly carbon price fluctuations and exogenous shocks, guided by a theory-based framework. The analysis incorporates firm-level data on direct and indirect carbon cost exposure, free allowance allocation, decarbonization plans, pass-through capacity, and hedging portfolios. The findings show that stock markets price carbon risk in line with economic fundamentals: firms with high net carbon costs and weak abatement plans face stronger valuation losses, while those with mitigation strategies or cost pass-through capacity are less affected. The effects are statistically and economically significant, particularly among the most exposed firms. These results underscore the need for granular transition risk metrics that go beyond headline emissions figures."}}

Although many models for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) exist, the integration of byproduct and waste management systems remains limited, potentially incurring increased costs and pollutant emissions. Moreover, existing optimization approaches inadequately capture the uncertainty of the treatment process effectiveness, which compromises the system’s ability to satisfy quality requirements. Thus, a target-oriented robust optimization (TORO) model for a hybrid WWTP and byproduct disposal system (BDS) that minimizes cost and environmental impact is developed. The case study implemented validates the model’s ability to balance objective trade-offs while underscoring the importance of the process effectiveness on the system’s performance. TORO allows decision makers to set targets and select solutions for managing hybrid WWTP-BDS systems based on their varying risk-appetites. These solutions show increased stability, demonstrating the potential of the proposed framework to enhance sustainability and robustness of wastewater management."}}

By combining analytical tools and numerical simulations, our model shows that the more time grandparents spend educating their grandchildren - quantity - and the more educated they are - quality -, the more education is transmitted from older to younger generations, who will have higher levels of human capital, which will generate higher economic growth. Such a mechanism repeats over time, generating virtuous paths that work as drivers of human capital and physical capital growth."}}

It shows that the definition of the economics of aging is less straightforward than expected and introduces some identification criteria to get quantitative results on the growth of the literature, its geography and its research agenda. One claim of the paper is that aging has emerged as a distinct topic that spans different fields, from population to labor economics, and has strong connections with health economics, macroeconomics and public economics. Topics of interest have evolved over time with notably a major growth for health issues. In addition, we show that the geography of the economics of aging does not correspond to the geography of aging, with Japan somewhat underrepresented in the literature. Lastly, we draw some lessons from this neglect in the dominant research agenda on the economics of aging and suggest directions for future research that would give to Japan more space in comparative studies, given its position at the forefront of aging."}}

We incorporate three key factors that shape system behavior: node heterogeneity, spatiotemporal competing strategies, and intra-system interaction patterns. Node heterogeneity includes variations in node parameters. Spatiotemporal engagement strategies arise from geographical distributions of nodes in a system that influence the engagement timing of nodes in opposing systems. Various interaction patterns influence resource consumption in complex systems. The proposed computational framework allows us to quantify how bidirectional attack-defense dependencies generate coupled vulnerability states of opposing systems. We find that prioritizing nodes with higher internal connectivity in the early stages of participation enhances the competitiveness of the system. Moreover, simulations demonstrate that Watts-Strogatz networks exhibit reduced competitiveness compared to scale-free and Erdős-Rényi random networks."}}

We characterize the economically efficient set using shortage functions and recover shadow prices for smooth and non-smooth production frontiers.  To address unobserved heterogeneity in technological orientation between the frontiers, we estimate a full-information maximum likelihood model with endogenous regime switching. Applying this framework to Chinese livestock farms, we recover regime-specific land costs, identify drivers of regime assignment, and quantify inefficiency via the by-production gap.

Leveraging a new, highly disaggregated territorial dataset, we estimate a two-stage instrumental variable model to address endogeneity in the relationship between social and institutional variables and saving choices. Our findings reveal that stronger family ties significantly reduce participation in complementary pension schemes, reinforcing traditional saving preferences. Conversely, higher levels of interpersonal trust and civicness are positively associated with adhesion in private welfare instruments. These results highlight a trade-off between informal family support and market-based welfare solutions, offering new empirical evidence on the cultural determinants of financial planning. Finally, we validate our results by testing their spatial stability through geographically varying estimation windows. The paper contributes to the literature by combining social capital (trust, cvicness, rtc.) economics with spatial econometrics to show the heterogeneous impact of these variables on financial behavior."}}

To address this limitation, we propose HMRM, a hybrid motion and region-fused Mamba network designed for efficient and accurate MER. HMRM enhances motion representation through a hybrid feature augmentation module that integrates gated recurrent unit (GRU)-attention optical flow estimation with a regional MotionMix enhancement strategy to increase motion diversity. Furthermore, it employs a grained Mamba encoder to achieve lightweight and effective long-range temporal modeling. Additionally, a regions feature fusion strategy is introduced to strengthen the representation of localized expression dynamics.

The conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method is too resource-intensive for evaluating early-stage concepts in the automotive industry. It requires extensive data and computational power, which can hinder the rapid development of designs. On the other hand, existing Design for Environment (DfE) strategies often lack practical usability in fast-paced industrial settings.The Material Matrix Assessment (MMA) is a novel qualitative DfE support tool that bridges this gap. It provides a pragmatic framework for rapidly screening alternative design concepts against key circular economy criteria, including recyclability, lightweight, and disassembly potential.To validate its effectiveness, the MMA was applied to redesign the front-end structure (FES) of a Fiat Panda. The methodology successfully filtered multiple concepts, identifying an optimal hybrid design featuring a thermoplastic CFRP crash box and recycled steel and aluminium components. This optimised FES not only meets OEM performance and safety requirements but also delivers significant environmental and resource benefits. A comparative LCA validated the new FES&apos;s ecological benefits, revealing a 20% reduction in total life-cycle emissions (≈42.28 kg CO2 per FES) compared to the FIAT Panda baseline. Although the use of lightweight aluminium and CFRP resulted in an 18% increase in manufacturing emissions, this trade-off was highly favourable: the 50.5% mass reduction dramatically improved fuel efficiency, leading to a significant 50.5% decrease in use-phase greenhouse gas emissions.The MMA offers a validated pathway for accelerating the any sector&apos;s transition towards cleaner production and a circular economy. This paper will pave the road to enable early-stage design evaluation, allowing for the identification of environmentally practical design concepts that satisfy performance and safety requirements."}}

While energy-only market designs seek to achieve this alignment through the formation of full-strength spot prices, many market operators suppress spot price below efficient levels and instead attempt to recreate incentives for reliability with capacity payments. Because storage resources offer into the market based on private estimates of opportunity costs, however, a failure to produce full-strength prices leads to lower offers and premature dispatch leading up to potential scarcity events, threatening reliability. This study describes the impact of energy market offer caps, capacity market non-performance penalties, and market participant beliefs on battery dispatch decisions. Through a series of simulations incorporating bids from battery operators, we demonstrate the reliability risk created by current capacity market configurations and explore potential solutions. We argue that current capacity markets will be increasingly inadequate to the task of ensuring reliability as liberalized markets add storage, necessitating reforms to strengthen spot price formation."}}

However, can the pressure on net interest margins (NIMs), induced by structural financial frictions, cause a reversal-rate-like effect to emerge prematurely even under a conventional monetary policy framework? In the context of China&apos;s tiered banking industry structure, small and medium-sized commercial banks (SMEs) face intense deposit competition, making them an ideal sample for this study. Using data from 183 SMEs from 2009 to 2023, we construct exogenous monetary policy shocks via a high-frequency identification method and employ multiple econometric methods to test our hypotheses. The study finds that an expansionary monetary policy shock causes a significant short-term decline in NIMs, prompting a defensive business restructuring. This restructuring manifests as a \"loan-to-securities\" asset shift and a pivot toward non-interest income, with the response being particularly pronounced for high-NIM banks. This asymmetric response results in an initial contraction in credit supply, where the bank risk-taking channel temporarily overpowers the credit channel. Our central contribution is to uncover the mechanism through which structural banking frictions alter the dynamic path of monetary policy transmission. We demonstrate that \"cost rigidity\" on the liability side can lead to an initial reversal of policy effects, creating a novel and challenging policy trade-off for central banks in economies with less developed financial systems. These findings show that the \"reversal rate\" is not just a ZLB-specific issue but a broader phenomenon rooted in market structure, with significant implications for financial stability and macroeconomic management."}}

Mineralogical analysis revealed that the ore predominantly consists of paragonite, muscovite, quartz, pyrophyllite, and calcite, with an average total REE content of 441 ppm. Thermally activated ore was subjected to acid leaching, and the resulting pregnant solution was purified using solvent extraction to separate aluminum and REEs.

To purify Al from the Fe- and K-rich solution post-SX, electrolysis was performed, resulting in 97.16% precipitation efficiency of Al as Al(OH)₃ at pH 5.

We hypothesise that the adjustment is asymmetric if traders are loss-averse. We test this model empirically, allowing for possible asymmetries in the exchange rate adjustment over commodity price booms and busts. We take four commodity-dependent economies with de jure flexible exchange rate regimes, open capital accounts, and relatively mature financial markets as case studies: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and South Africa. Our results confirm all four currencies as commodity currencies. We further find that short-run asymmetries in the exchange rate adjustment originate in the risk premium, whereas long-run asymmetries are linked to the terms-of-trade channel."}}

Women are underrepresented in traditional fields like mechanical and electrical engineering, hold less than 10% of senior roles, and are often excluded from core tasks due to safety-based biases. Family expectations and lack of workplace support further disrupt their careers. The study argues that gender inequality stems from educational, cultural, and institutional structures, calling for reforms in culture, policy, and infrastructure to create a more equitable engineering environment."}}

Using survey data from 348 SMEs, it finds KP mediates the KA/KI-NPD link, emphasizing its role in securing innovation. Technology adoption (TA) enhances KI-KP but not KA-KP, while resource orchestration capability (ROC) does not moderate KP-NPD, suggesting strategic misalignment. The study highlights the need to balance knowledge openness and protection, leveraging digital tools for secure collaboration. The study explores how KM and technology drive food industry innovation, revealing KP&apos;s dual role and TA/ROC&apos;s moderating effects."}}
