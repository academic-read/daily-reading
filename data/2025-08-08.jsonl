While credit can fuel growth and investment, it may also exposes borrowers to heightened risk, making its effect on resilience ambiguous. Focusing on Pakistan's SUCCESS program, I leverage a loan eligibility threshold to show that credit access boosted loan uptake from 1% to 46% among eligible households, spurring a 22% increase in livestock. Yet, this came at the cost of reduced investment in housing quality, leading to greater flood damage and displacements. Exploiting the spatial variation in the intensity of 2022 floods in Pakistan, I find that within highly-flooded villages, loan-eligible households have 24% fewer livestock, deteriorating mental health, and higher rates of loan default after the floods. In contrast, loan-eligible households within low-flooded villages, continue to accumulate livestock, with a gap emerging between loan-eligible households in high-and low-flooded villages over time. These results suggest that in settings with incomplete financial markets, credit access could induce a tradeoff between growth and resilience."}}

Over the past decade, extensive research has focused on extracting valuable information from app reviews, including feature requests and bug reports. However, there remains a lack of a synthesis of research related to app review analysis for exploring users&apos; ethical concerns. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of this research area, covering 37 relevant studies published since 2012, identified from the initial 553 studies using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies examined vary in review counts, ranging from 500 to 626 million, and include between a single and 1.3 million apps. Our detailed analysis highlights diverse objectives, methodologies, and strategies, along with additional resources such as app privacy policies, which researchers generally utilize to analyze ethical concerns. Our findings also identify persistent barriers to privacy, security, accessibility, transparency, fairness, accountability, and safety, as reported by users in app reviews. Furthermore, we propose a research agenda that focuses on four key areas, including automated extraction and classification of ethical concerns-related app reviews. Our survey outcomes can assist developers and system architects in recognizing and prioritizing non-functional requirements at the initial stages of the development lifecycle, whereas researchers can expand upon this synthesis to create tools for the automated detection of ethical concerns."}}

Uncoordinated transportation and processing-assembly production often lead to delayed component delivery, production disruptions, and higher costs. Thus, this paper addresses the collaborative scheduling of production and transportation in a reconfigurable assembly job shop. To adapt to the modern decentralized decision-making structure, a bi-level scheduling model is formulated. The processing-assembly production considering machine reconfiguration with limited and shareable auxiliary modules (AMs) acts as the upper-level problem, while the work-in-process transportation considering batch transfer acts as the lower-level problem. To solve it, a learning-based bi-level metaheuristic algorithm is developed, with genetic algorithm and simulated annealing optimizing the upper- and lower-level problems, respectively. Moreover, to address the challenge of dynamic allocation and sharing of AMs, a reinforcement learning-based AM selection model is designed to assist genetic algorithm in finding appropriate AMs in the dynamic resource-constrained environment. To balance solution quality and the enormous computational complexity caused by repeated re-optimization of similar lower-level problems, a transfer learning-based lower-level initialization model is designed to assist simulated annealing in creating high-quality solutions with lower computational complexity by migrating knowledge from lower-level problems with similar upper-level decisions. Experiments prove that the proposed learning-based algorithm exceeds other comparison algorithms in coordinating production and transportation, achieving a 30.9% improvement in the average linkage degree of processing and assembly and a 30.8% reduction in the average total operating costs."}}

It assumes that specialists excel in adaptation given their deep knowledge in specific areas but face coordination challenges given limited knowledge of other areas. In contrast, generalists benefit from broad task experience, making them superior in coordination but less effective in adaptation than specialists. The model predicts the following monotonicity: the optimal organizational structure shifts from one with many specialists to one with many generalists as the importance of coordination (relative to adaptation) increases or as market uncertainty increases under the condition that the importance of coordination is sufficiently high. These predictions are tested using employee assignment history data from a large Japanese trading company. The dataset includes employees who joined the company in fiscal year 1984 or later and their records up to fiscal year 2023. As predicted, divisions in commodity trading, where adaptation to their market condition is relatively crucial, have more specialists than divisions in business investment, where coordination is key. Among the business investment divisions, the proportion of generalists is higher in those with higher market uncertainty."}}

In this paper, we propose a complex theoretical framework that integrates Self-Determination Theory (SDT), Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to enhance motivation among learners, engagement, and instructional design in tertiary educational settings. The framework meets the pedagogical necessity of an intensive model that allows immersive technology to align with evidence-based learning principles. The meta-analysis and synthesis of 15 recent empirical studies, conducted between 2019 and 2022, reveal a consistent finding that holographic instruction facilitates learning outcomes, enhancing retention of information, spatial understanding, student satisfaction, and instructor motivation. Significant effect size calibrations in the context of controlled experiments in nursing, engineering, and the teaching of geometry show high values (η² = 0.34-0.83), indicating the efficacy of Holography as an instructional tool, especially in visual-spatial situations. The proposed framework encompasses pedagogical skills, technology infrastructure development, content development for an interactive environment, and faculty development, all of which contribute to providing a student-centered and scalable learning environment. The implementation guidelines are presented in phases to ensure that the adaptations in higher education can be adopted sustainably. The framework serves as a plan of action. It can be utilized by learning institutions that wish to integrate Holography into their curriculum development processes, stimulate active learning, and achieve educational equity and accessibility.

This gap is particularly pronounced in the Middle East region, where a critical disconnect persists between labor market expectations and students’ preparedness with future-relevant competencies. Grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory, this study investigates how blended learning environments and skill-based education cultivate employability skills. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling to analyze survey data from 782 students enrolled in skill-based higher education programs, students’ interpersonal skills was identified as the strongest predictor of employability skills, followed by problem-solving skills and student engagement. Comparative analysis reveals that blended learning outperforms traditional face-to-face instruction in cultivating employability skills, particularly in fostering higher-order thinking and culturally responsive teaching practices. The findings position blended and skill-based learning as critical drivers of human capital development, offering practical implications for curriculum design and institutional policy."}}

The manual was created to provide clear, concise instructions and support hands-on training for first-year Electrical Technology students. A structured survey questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale was administered to 40 participants to assess the manual's usability across four dimensions: clarity of instructions, ease of use, task support, and perceived usefulness. The results revealed high overall usability, with an average mean score of 4.14 (SD = 0.50), indicating strong acceptance and satisfaction among users. The highest ratings were observed in perceived usefulness (M = 4.30, SD = 0.45) and clarity of instructions (M = 4.23, SD = 0.47), highlighting the manual's effectiveness in improving learner confidence and comprehension. Ease of use (M = 4.08, SD = 0.52) and task support (M = 3.95, SD = 0.58) were also rated positively, though some users suggested enhancements in troubleshooting guidance and navigation. These findings suggest that the operations manual is a valuable educational resource that facilitates independent learning and practical skills development in FDAS installation, testing, and troubleshooting. Recommendations include expanding troubleshooting content, improving visual aids, and optimizing manual layout to further enhance usability. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the critical role of well-designed printed instructional materials in technical education, particularly in resource-constrained environments where digital tools may be limited. The manual serves as an effective bridge between theoretical knowledge and hands-on application, fostering learner autonomy and confidence."}}

Both states have attempted to politicize the Pakhtun community through framing their national identity with ethno-national and pan-Islamic narratives.

This thesis explores what social effect such narratives have had on Pakhtunwali and related Pakhtun tribal institutions as a result. Implications for regime stability in Afghanistan are assessed using visual models that identify points of congruence between social narratives and their Pakhtun audience. The theoretical foundations established by “framing” in social movement theory literature is relied upon for this study of strategic narratives. These narrative-based framing interactions are considered in the larger context of English School theory’s international and regional “world” societies. Both primary and secondary academic sources were consulted for the case study in the absence of field research.

However, the encoded features in the hidden layers of SAE might not be the preferable representations for predicting output, because the unsupervised pretraining process usually focuses on self-reconstruction of the input. More importantly, although the consideration of quality information in the pretraining process has been demonstrated to be helpful for enhancing model accuracy, the potential contributions of the predictions generated by individual AE units to the final quality prediction are neglected. These recognitions motivate us to design a novel soft sensing model called least square regressive SAE (LSRSAE), which involves two main modifications made for traditional SAE-based soft sensors. First, a novel loss function which enables each AE unit to simultaneously deal with the issues of input reconstruction and quality prediction, is devised for layer-wise pretraining process. Second, multiple predictions generated from different AEs are further processed by a novel least square regressive layer with parameter learned by the least square regression algorithm. On the basis of these two modifications, the salient soft sensing performance of LSRSAE is guaranteed, which has been thoroughly validated through comparative experiments on two real industrial processes."}}

Drawing from a comprehensive analysis of 155 peer-reviewed studies, the review reveals that predictive HRIS has shifted HR planning from reactive, spreadsheet-based processes to proactive, algorithm-driven forecasting tools. Findings indicate that organizations using predictive analytics experienced measurable gains in internal mobility, attrition reduction, and leadership succession planning accuracy. Over 70 studies highlighted the critical importance of technological infrastructure-including cloud-based platforms, middleware solutions, and API integration-in enabling scalable predictive functionality. However, the study also brings to light the rising significance of ethical, legal, and compliance considerations, particularly regarding employee surveillance, data privacy, and algorithmic bias. Additionally, global and sectoral disparities in adoption underscore the influence of cultural, regulatory, and infrastructural contexts. The review concludes that while predictive HRIS holds significant strategic value, its effective implementation demands not only technical readiness but also ethical stewardship, legal compliance, and contextual adaptation."}}

Predictive modeling, driven by machine learning (ML) techniques, plays an increasingly essential role in enabling firms to identify customers at high risk of churn and to implement proactive retention interventions. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive synthesis of contemporary advancements in ML-based customer retention analytics, focusing on predictive models and churn analysis across diverse industries, including telecommunications, banking, e-commerce, and subscription-based services. Utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, 112 peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025 were rigorously selected to ensure methodological rigor and relevance. The review systematically categorizes ML techniques into supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid approaches, with a particular emphasis on widely adopted algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and deep neural networks, including convolutional and recurrent architectures. In addition, it critically evaluates feature engineering methods, data preprocessing practices, dataset properties, and model evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and cost-sensitive measures. Special attention is given to emerging research domains, including explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), real-time predictive analytics, transfer learning, and federated learning, which enhance model transparency, adaptability, and privacy compliance. Findings from the review reveal that ensemble methods and deep learning models consistently outperform traditional classifiers in detecting intricate churn patterns, particularly when behavioral, transactional, and sentiment-based features are integrated. The review also underscores the growing importance of interpretable models, post-hoc explanation techniques such as SHAP and LIME, and privacy-preserving methodologies to address challenges related to algorithmic opacity, ethical compliance, and deployment scalability. By mapping the evolution of ML-driven churn analytics, identifying persistent research gaps, and proposing actionable directions for future inquiry, this study contributes to both the academic literature and practical applications in customer retention strategy development."}}

Drawing from a dataset of 112 peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2010 and 2024, the study employs a meta-analytic methodology following PRISMA guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and analytical depth. The research systematically categorizes analytics into descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive models, evaluating their implementation across key business functions including marketing, finance, operations, supply chain, human resources, and strategic management. Findings demonstrate that organizations with high analytics maturity achieve significantly better performance outcomes in terms of profitability, process efficiency, decision quality, and return on investment compared to their lower-maturity counterparts. Firms that integrate analytics across departments and align it with enterprise strategy report the greatest benefits, including improved responsiveness to market dynamics, enhanced customer engagement, and more effective capital allocation. The study further reveals that enabling factors such as executive sponsorship, cross-functional data integration, workforce analytics literacy, and robust governance frameworks are critical to unlocking the full potential of analytics. Comparative evaluation of theoretical models-including the Resource-Based View (RBV), Dynamic Capabilities Theory, Information Processing Theory (IPT), and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework-provides insight into the mechanisms through which analytics capabilities translate into sustained competitive advantage. The analysis also identifies gaps related to construct standardization, sectoral applicability, and scalability, offering methodological and strategic recommendations for future research and practice. Ultimately, this study affirms that data analytics is not merely a technological function but a transformative, enterprise-wide capability that drives sustainable value creation, operational excellence, and strategic agility in an increasingly data-driven global economy. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how organizations can harness analytics to navigate complexity, enhance performance, and foster innovation."}}

Coiled tubing (CT) is the core component of the DRIS system, its fatigue life is crucial to the safe operation of the system. At present, the analysis of coiled tubing is mainly based on mathematical models based on experiments, which has a complex modeling process and high analysis cost. Neural network technology can quickly analyze and simulate a large amount of data while maintaining a high prediction accuracy due to its excellent function mapping ability and highly nonlinear expression level. This paper focuses on the 4.5-inch UDRIS system, using numerical simulation for fatigue analysis to meet the needs of ultra-deepwater pre-commissioning operations and improve the fatigue life assessment method. On this basis, a low and high-cycle fatigue life prediction model of UDRIS design parameters based on Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) was established to analyze the factors affecting fatigue life and achieve a complete, fast and accurate prediction of CT fatigue life."}}

We employ a difference-in-differences specification by using a panel dataset covering counties along 20 major rivers from 2001 to 2013. The results show that EID exacerbates transboundary pollution. Specifically, following EID implementation, the most downstream county of a province emits approximately 40% more water pollutants than otherwise identical counties. The underlying mechanism appears to be more lenient enforcement of environmental penalties in these downstream counties due to EID pressures. Our analysis also reveals that this exacerbation of transboundary pollution is driven by the relocation of water-polluting firms from one county to downstream counties, rather than by an increase in newly established firms or higher pollution emissions from incumbent firms. This paper highlights an unintended consequence of EID, specifically the distortion of pollution activity distribution across regions."}}

Despite being vital for achieving SDGs, grid-cell-level analysis remains notably absent from existing literature. To address this gap, we take 48 coastal prefecture-level cities in China as our research subject, and investigate the spatiotemporal variations in SDG performance through a spatially explicit evaluation method that considers evenness among all goals. The results showed overall improvement in the level of sustainable development in China’s coastal cities from 2000 to 2020. Among them, Zhuhai, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Guangzhou, Zhongshan, and Qingdao maintained relatively sustainable development levels in this time. However, the magnitude of the trade-offs between SDG 9 and SDG 7 and SDG 13 increased, which highlights the urgency for Chinese coastal cities to accelerate technological innovation and transform their industrial models. Coastal cities with developed economies have greater potential to achieve SDGs, but also face bottlenecks due to unevenness among the goals.In particular, there are significant deficiencies in goals related to climate action. Nevertheless, coastal cities with relatively weak economies – mainly those located in the Guangxi and Liaoning provinces – performed well on SDGs related to the environment. Overall, enhancing cooperation among cities may provide a development path for the realization of SDGs in China’s coastal regions."}}

Climate change can be expected to affect both the benefits and costs of a particular restoration project, through changing crop yields, shifting vegetation, and urbanization, among other factors, potentially leading to abandonment of sites or forgone opportunity. Here, we first present a framework for understanding the effect of projected social and ecological changes on potential economic value of a restoration project. We then apply the model to an empirical context of interest: habitat-focused forest planting in Brazil, focusing on the implications of two specific climate change projections: changing crop yields and changing forest cover habitat. We find that active restoration could yield a positive return in a majority of grid cells across the country, monetizing benefits of restored lands by considering habitat value alone, yet that integrating projections of conditions in 2050 yields greater expected benefits than present conditions would suggest, with an increase of 41 percent in the median tract and significant spatial variation. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for projected changes in conditions in restoration planning and find support for the economic value of wide-scale restoration programs which provide biodiversity protection."}}

The results indicate that 75.1% of farmers are aware of NCFRs, with roughly 65.8% actively utilising these resources, predominantly kitchen waste and animal waste. Nonetheless, considerable regional disparities are evident in adoption rates and the varieties of feed utilised. For instance, Mwenezi districts predominantly depend on kitchen waste, whereas Makoni exhibits a broader array of feed alternatives, including insects and worms. Cost-effectiveness (64.9%) and availability (55.4%) were the predominant incentives for the adoption of NCFRs, surpassing nutritional benefits (22.6%) and environmental sustainability (10.2%). All districts indicated unanimous endorsement for training and education, underscoring their essential function in promoting the incorporation of NCFRs into aquaculture practices. The findings indicate that NCFRs can substantially enhance sustainable aquaculture development, thereby improving livelihoods and food security for small-scale fish farmers in Zimbabwe by tackling these challenges. Future research must concentrate on assessing the nutritional profiles of NCFRs and their biological compatibility with fish, advancing processing technologies, and evaluating the economic feasibility of these alternative feed sources across diverse aquaculture systems."}}

However, this advantage diminishes over time, leading to poorer physical conditions at later ages. By examining the healthcare consumption patterns of the self-employed, we can distinguish two phases over the life cycle. During their careers, self-employed individuals are more likely to be hospitalized compared to salaried workers, all things being equal, indicating that they tend to delay seeking care until it becomes absolutely necessary. Post-retirement, we observe a significant increase in medical visits among the self-employed, likely due to the reduced opportunity cost of utilizing healthcare resources."}}

Expanding on this idea, I examine how this strategy shapes ideological platforms. Using a model that distinguishes between valence and ideological issues, and assuming one party (e.g., the right party) faces a valence disadvantage, I identify four key outcomes: (i) both parties&apos; equilibrium platforms shift rightward, with weaker valence politicians gaining partisan support; (ii) heightened correlation between campaign effectiveness and voter ideologies shifts platforms rightward; (iii) ideological polarization among voters drives policy positions rightward for both parties; and (iv) considerations of ideological consistency prompt the advantaged party toward moderation while the disadvantaged party moves toward extremes."}}

However, Islamic countries face specific challenges in the field of entrepreneurship. Some researchers argue that Islam may hinder the development of entrepreneurial activities in Muslim societies, especially due to restrictions such as the prohibition of usury (Riba). However, the presence of Islamic banking, as a financial system compliant with Sharia, can provide an alternative financial tool that removes these barriers and creates favorable conditions for entrepreneurship development. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to examine the impact of Islam and the Islamic banking system on entrepreneurial activities in the member countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). This study investigates whether Islam, as a religion, can hinder entrepreneurship development and how Islamic banking plays a role in enhancing or moderating these effects. The central research question is whether entrepreneurial activities are strengthened in Muslim countries with Islamic banking systems or whether Sharia restrictions still negatively affect them. This study aims to open this discussion and offer recommendations to improve entrepreneurship conditions in Islamic countries. Methodology: To investigate the impact of Islam on entrepreneurship while considering the moderating role of Islamic banking, the study adopts regression models based on the work of Kamdjo (2024) and Farzanegan &amp; Badrelin (2023):"}}

On the other hand, in developed countries, one of the important goals of economic policymakers is to improve the quality, standard, and level of well-being of life in society. In developing countries, economic growth is not the only goal; rather, these countries, along with developed countries, consider increasing social welfare as one of the main goals and criteria for development (Sadeghi et al., 2010, p. 144). Measuring well-being is one of the foundations of public policy in societies and is also considered one of the characteristics of development. The status of the welfare index and its measurement methods can play a significant role in determining its compliance with the reality of society. However, comparing the different perspectives of experts will further reveal their differences and similarities in the topic of welfare and measuring its index. A review of the research background shows that although studies have been conducted on methods for measuring well-being indices, such as Sharp's research in 1999, which examined five composite well-being indices with 22 variables; but, no study has been conducted in the Persian language on the comparative study of methods for measuring the welfare index and"}}

FACS-Net employs frequency-aware attention in its decoder, while CT-Loss improves topological continuity in segmentation masks. Evaluation in CrackVision12K, using width-based IoU and CTS metrics, shows that FACS-Net achieves notable gains for thin cracks (width[[EQUATION]]2px), raising IoU by 0.306 and CTS by 0.360 over the Hybrid-Segmentor. On average, FACS-Net establishes new state-of-the-art results with IoU of 0.663 and CTS of 0.651, demonstrating its effectiveness for precise crack segmentation and robust topological preservation."}}

To address project-level finance inefficiencies, we introduce jurisdictional reward funds targeting governments, which also generate implicit wealth transfers to LMICs. A self-enforcing coalition of fossil fuel importers, such as the European Union and China, could mobilize USD 66 billion annually for mitigation in LMICs, cutting emissions by 1060 Mt CO2 per year and transferring USD 33 billion per year. LMICs additionally benefit from USD 78 billion in reduced climate damages and USD 19 billion from lower fuel prices.

This limitation has led to the development of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection approaches, which aim to identify samples out of the training distribution. While recent advancements have achieved promising results without requiring prior knowledge of unseen classes or examples of seen classes (zero-shot ODD), they often rely on training or fine-tuning auxiliary models and struggle with fine-grained OOD detection. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot approach called Self-Learning OOD Detection (SL-OOD) that minimizes training costs by training only a lightweight classifier rather than an entire auxiliary model. SL-OOD leverages a self-learning cycle to train the classifier using pre-trained models and a strategy for assigning pseudo-labels to data while addressing the challenges of fine-grained classification data. We develop a strategy based on a statistical analysis of the trained classifier&apos;s output logits to estimate the likelihood of a sample being out-of-distribution. Experimental evaluations on six diverse datasets demonstrate that SL-OOD outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods while offering a modular and versatile OOD detection framework."}}

From this set of assumptions, game theorists make predictions about game outcomes and interactions between players. The basis of this theory was analyzed by Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) in a book titled \"Game Theory and Economic Behavior\", and then John Nash developed this theory between 1950-1953. On the other hand, ethics is a normative discipline that is obtained from reflection on moral behavior and attitudes. The relationship between the ethical approach and game theory is considered as two emerging areas in research and study activities in social sciences and humanities. The application of game theory in ethics dates back to 1954, when Richard Braithway (1954) gave a lecture on \"Game Theory as a Tool for Moral Philosophy\". There are two very important concepts related to game theory and ethics, which are related to altruistic (altruistic) behaviors or preferences or behaviors based on personal interest. However, in the framework of the ethical approach, self-interested preferences are known as the approach of egoism or individual rationality, and altruistic behavior is known as the approach of others or group rationality. The concepts of self-interest and altruism are at the center of all kinds of philosophical and social discussions, and their roots go back to the sophists and philosophers of ancient Greece, who considered \"self\" to be the center of moral issues."}}

In the first phase I was given responsibility for the development of a 17 acre parcel of land part of the Tobago Plantations Ltd. development. At the same time I was also placed on the Vanguard Ltd board of directors with a mandate to understand the difficulties being experienced by the Tobago Hilton which was built at Tobago Plantations development. Later that year I was also given the responsibility to develop a master plan for the Golden Grove (600 acre) and Buccoo estates (300 acres.) These two estates were green field sites that were originally approved for agricultural use but had been recently been granted change of use, to be developed as resort properties. I put together a development team comprising of Fluor Daniel, Summit Engineering, EDSA, Alpha Engineering, HVS and Paul Duesing Partners. My main consultant partner was Hal Thannisch CEO of TDS ltd. who helped put the team together. The first goal was to obtain a “certificate of environmental clearance “ which is the approval to physical build the resort. These estate were some of the most sensitive properties on the island as they bordered a national marine park. This paper highlights the process we took to get full approval which ended up with permission to build 2,500 mixed use rooms. The development plan was developed and used to obtain the CEC, the first step in the process&nbsp;to physically develop the property. Phase 1 was the development of Samaan Grove a 30 acre site seen at the bottom of the development. I retired (May 2010) by which time 98% of all the property had been sold and considerable development had taken place. As of the update of this paper over 70% of the lots have been developed and it has become one of the choice residential developments on the island of Tobago."}}

However, research on high-FAR school design strategies—especially in rapidly developing regions—remains limited. This study systematically analyzes 67 high-FAR primary and secondary schools in Shenzhen, China. Using the N-gram model, the analysis identified five major design strategies: responses to regulations, functional integration of classroom spaces, functional integration of public spaces, climate adaptation and sustainability, and alleviation of psychological stress. Correlation analysis revealed that factors—including FAR, total floor area, and design year of the schools, as well as regional GDP and investment in the education sector—significantly influence preferences for different design strategies. Further, K-means clustering categorized four types based on strategy adoption and FAR: the comprehensive strategy type is most suitable for schools with FAR ranging from 0.9 to 1.6, where sufficient construction land is available; the user-centered innovation type applies to schools with FAR exceeding 3.2; the spatial integration type is appropriate for schools with FAR ranging from 1.6 to 3.2 that require enhanced space-use efficiency; the psychological well-being type is applicable to schools with FAR ranging from 1.6 to 3.2, where spatial organization is highly compact and demands emotional comfort. The results emphasize the need for adaptable design strategies that reflect local development stages. These findings contribute to a data-informed foundation for improving spatial efficiency in rapidly urbanizing settings, offering policy and design guidance for rapid developing cities."}}

Our results suggest that more capital, lower ratios of loans to deposits and of liquid assets to total assets and lower share of non-deposit and short-term funding in total funding are associated with lower bank risk and this relationship is stronger during crisis periods. Moreover, having low costs compared to their revenues reduces the risk of European banks in normal times and has the same impact during crises times. Being involved in non-interest-generating activities makes banks riskier. Finally, being large and having higher net interest margin make banks more stable, but this positive effect is diminished for the size and vanished for the profitability during crisis times. And some differences are observed between Western and Eastern European countries."}}

The influence of commodity idiosyncratic co-movements on China’s financial market risk is relatively stable under normal economic conditions but intensifies significantly during periods of deteriorating economic fundamentals.

Faith-based organizations (FBOs) do not have an accepted and uniform definition. In summary, faith organization and community refers to a group of people who have the same faith and values and especially interact with each other to cooperate and support each other.

This study leverages data from the 2018 PISA assessment to examine gender differences in the relationship between financial literacy and both traditional and digital financial inclusion among youth. Using the Lewbel method to address endogeneity, the analysis reveals that financial literacy significantly enhances financial and digital financial inclusion. However, persistent gender disparities remain, especially in traditional financial inclusion, where girls are less likely than boys to own bank accounts or payment cards. Gaps in confidence are also notable, with girls being up to 50 percentage points less likely to feel confident performing financial and digital financial tasks compared to boys. Encouragingly, participation in a financial literacy course significantly improves girls&apos; confidence, highlighting its potential to reduce these disparities. Yet, greater confidence does not necessarily translate to increased financial service participation, suggesting the continued presence of external barriers to financial inclusion. These findings underscore the need for targeted policy interventions to promote early financial education, digital skill development, and confidence-building among girls, laying a foundation for their economic empowerment in the digital age."}}

As a new driver of development, the digital economy is deeply embedded in the export process of green products, demonstrating significant potential. Based on this, this paper focuses on the relationship between the digital economy and green product exports, exploring its impact mechanisms and policy implications. Using a sample of 51 countries from 2007 to 2022, we construct a digital economy index comprising 3 primary indicators and 14 secondary indicators, with scores calculated using factor analysis. Green product export volume serves as the dependent variable, and a two-way fixed-effects model is employed for empirical analysis of the impact mechanisms. The findings reveal: first, the digital economy significantly promotes green product exports, a result supported by multiple robustness tests; second, there are heterogeneous effects across different categories of green products and national income levels, with the digital economy having a more pronounced impact on \"equipment for waste treatment and control of solids, liquids, and gases\" and upper-middle-income countries; third, mechanism analysis indicates that the digital economy primarily enhances exports by driving industrial green transformation and technological innovation. Accordingly, policy recommendations are proposed to strengthen infrastructure, optimize the innovation environment, and improve green policies to promote high-quality development of green exports in China."}}

While theoretical frameworks posit a strong link between innovation and economic performance, this relationship remains empirically underexplored in many developing nations, including Ethiopia. The primary objective of this research is to dissect the causal pathways between disaggregated innovation inputs (such as institutions, human capital, and infrastructure) and innovation outputs (knowledge, technology, and creative outputs), and their subsequent impact on real GDP per capita growth. Employing a quantitative time-series approach, the study utilizes Vector Autoregression (VAR) models and the Toda–Yamamoto procedure for Granger causality testing to ensure robust inference in the presence of non-stationary data. The findings reveal a complex, multi-faceted relationship. We find strong evidence that innovation inputs systematically Granger-cause innovation outputs, highlighting a functional internal innovation ecosystem. Crucially, the results support a partial supply-leading hypothesis, where Knowledge and Technology Outputs are identified as the sole, direct driver of economic growth. Concurrently, evidence for a demand-following hypothesis emerges, as GDP growth is found to Granger-cause improvements in Business Sophistication and Creative Outputs. No direct bidirectional causality was observed. This research contributes by providing nuanced, evidence-based insights for Ethiopian policymakers, suggesting that strategic focus must be placed on the mechanisms that translate innovation inputs into tangible technological outputs to foster sustainable economic growth."}}

The primary challenge for the task is to accurately segment clear structures in high-resolution images while maintaining faster running speed. Most existing methods rely on powerful backbone networks to achieve high performance, but this comes at the cost of slow running speeds. Depth images have been shown to provide complementary information, but directly applying them to high-resolution images significantly increases model parameters, leading to substantial memory and GPU overhead. To address this, we propose a lightweight and fast RGB-D framework for high-resolution DIS task. We first employs a shared backbone to extract high and low-resolution RGB features. An extra backbone is used to extract complementary low-resolution depth features. Within the Attention Guided Depth Calibration (AGDC) module, two attention mechanisms are embedded to mitigate the impact of low-quality depth estimations. Finally, we decompose the ground truth into body, detail, and full masks to construct a three-branch decoder. Two symmetric decoders progressively refine the body and detail feature. Furthermore, we propose two Mutual Guided Complementary Integration (MGCI) modules at deep and shallow layers to integrate the body and detail features, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules, achieving competitive performance while exhibiting advantages in simplicity, efficiency (30.7 FPS), and model size (24.4 MB).

This paper argues that this is not a superficial issue, but a deep interpretive tension. We resolve this by first reexamining the mathematical foundations of discounting. We demonstrate that the discounting operator possesses a unique fixed point at the utility level of zero for any non-zero discount rate. We argue that this unique mathematical property makes u = 0 a non-arbitrary, endogenous reference point for intertemporal valuation. This finding provides a new, rigorous foundation for challenging the axiom of strict affine invariance and formally defines a 'positive domain' (u &gt; 0) and a 'negative domain' (u &lt; 0). Building on this foundation, we propose a new coherence rule: the Matched-Sign Discounting Condition. This condition requires the sign of the total \"Discount\"-the change in value from future to present-to match an agent's expressed time orientation. We show that this axiom implies a powerful and clear rule for model specification: to coherently model a present-oriented agent, the chosen Effective Rate of Discounting, ρ, must have the same sign as the utility function, u(c). This result is rationalized by a framework that un-bundles the discounting parameter. We redefine it as being composed of a stable, innate Discount Severity, |ρ|, and a rationally chosen Operational Sign, sgn(ρ), which is used as an instrument to satisfy the matched-sign rule. A key implication of this framework is a novel, structural link between an agent's risk aversion and the qualitative direction of their savings behavior. Our model predicts a \"regime switch\" at θ = 1 and a rich spectrum of consumption path choices, allowing us to formally distinguish between two psychologically distinct types of savers: those who save reluctantly due to high returns, and those who save voluntarily due to precautionary motives. Furthermore, it provides a new transmission mechanism for institutional quality to influence macroeconomic dynamics. Our findings challenge the common practice of assuming ρ &gt; 0 by default and provide a clear, actionable rule for the coherent specification of intertemporal models."}}

Under Cournot competition, when the substitutability of exported goods is relatively low (high), the optimal level of CSR would be higher (lower), and thus the importing country’s social welfare would be greater (less) under a discriminatory tariff compared to a uniform tariff. Furthermore, if substitutability is low (moderate), both the importing and exporting countries favor a discriminatory (uniform) tariff. It contrasts with the literature on strategic export policy, where all the importing and exporting countries have contrasting preferences on the two tariff regimes. Under Bertrand competition, we find that a discriminatory tariff policy leads to at least the same level of CSR as a uniform tariff policy, making it weakly superior in terms of welfare for the importing country."}}

To reconcile these two facts, we propose a model in which a representative voter chooses whether to elect a unified government—where a single party controls policymaking—or a divided government—where agenda-setting and veto powers are held by different parties. The government then observes a common shock and decides which of two policy dimensions to reform, if any. On the consensual policy dimension, both parties and the voter have aligned preferences (e.g., infrastructure spending), whereas on the divisive dimension (e.g., taxation), they disagree with positive probability: party l (r) has more leftist (rightist) preferences than the voter. A distinctive feature of our model is that the government faces an agenda constraint: it can reform only one dimension per term.&nbsp;<span>We show that divided government sometimes leads to inefficient gridlock. Nevertheless, the voter may elect a divided government for fear that a unified government will waste its legislative time on divisive reforms, crowding out potentially beneficial consensual reforms. In a dynamic extension, we show that the expectation that the voter will elect divided governments polarizes the parties—but less so than if the voter could elect only unified governments. Hence, our paper uncovers a novel benefit of checks and balances: the ability to elect divided governments not only minimizes the inefficiencies of delegating policymaking to polarized parties, but also reduces party polarization in the first place.</span>\n <br>\n</div>"}}

From these foundations, we draw on the established literature on the political economy of international monetary relations and international finance to derive predictions about the future of cryptocurrency in a world of sovereign states. We describe four possible futures for the international monetary system: a world without cryptocurrency, a world in which cryptocurrency exists alongside fiat currency, a world in which cryptocurrency has replaced traditional fiat currency, and a techno-futuristic world in which cryptocurrency spells the end of the Westphalian state system. We evaluate the political and economic stability of each of these four scenarios.

I examine this phenomenon in Malaysian regional markets by analyzing the 2017 EU trade resolution that phases out palm oil imports to reduce upstream deforestation. These markets contain two distinct producer types-smallholders and large estates-whose land expansion decisions are linked through equilibrium prices, creating potential for within-market leakage when one type reduces production in response to policy, thereby incentivizing expansion by the other type and partially offsetting intended environmental benefits. I develop and estimate a dynamic single-agent supply-side model of oil palm land-use using aggregate market data. Results show that large estate expansion substantially offsets deforestation reductions from decreased smallholder activity, as large estates benefit from lower entry costs and access to more profitable alternative land uses. Counterfactual analysis reveals that while a targeted per-unit tax on large estates would enhance deforestation reduction, large estates have strong incentives to block such policies even with full tax revenue redistribution. In contrast, sanctioning supplier quantity coordination emerges as a superior policy alternative that simultaneously prevents further deforestation by both producer types while increasing intensive margin profits for each, making it both environmentally effective and politically feasible."}}

This ODRL-derived measure of agency conflicts is significantly associated with common misconduct proxies, including corporate fraud, earnings management, option backdating, and opportunistic insider trading.

The present study complements previous estimates of price rigidity in the context of identifying empirical signs of certain pricing models based on Russian data. The empirical analysis is based on data about Moscow online retailers collected on a daily basis from February 2019 to June 2020. The data cover 33 food categories, 54 non-food categories and seven service categories. The work obtained the following empirical results, which, with some degree of convention, may be inherent in the Russian economy as a whole. The work did not reveal an explicit dependence of the size of the price change on the duration of the period of price unchanged. The Golosov-Luсas model turned out to be the closest in terms of coincidence of stylized factors for Moscow online retailers in the studied time period, but no complete coincidence was found. Pricing behavior of Russian retailers refers to hybrid pricing models which include pricing elements that depend both on the state of the economy and on time. Decomposition of inflation into intensive (average size of price changes) and extensive (the share of goods whose prices have changed in a given period) components indicates a significant contribution of the intensive component to the price dynamics based on Russian data. A similar result is typical for inflation dispersion in which the contribution of the intensive component to the dispersion decomposition turns out to be the highest. The results obtained are not fully stable in relation to the period under consideration and can be adjusted as the sample expands."}}

Though Quantum computing brings a lot of opportunities, Quantum computers pose a significant risk to currently used Public Key Cryptography (PKC) algorithms (RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, DH, ECDH), with NIST mandating their deprecation by 2030 and complete removal by 2035. This urgency is heightened by predictions that state actors might possess quantum decryption capabilities as early as 2028, creating a “harvest now, decrypt later” threat. The only way to stay ahead of these attacks is to be aware of security trends, anticipate advanced threats, and build resilient defences. This study investigates the cybersecurity preparedness of India’s Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector in response to the emerging quantum computing threat. <br><br>The research, which included an analysis of the banking ecosystem, its stakeholders, and supply chains, employed a survey of approximately 118 BFSI CISOs/CTOs to assess current cybersecurity postures, awareness of quantum threats, and readiness for migrating to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The survey revealed significant vulnerabilities: a substantial portion of respondents demonstrated only moderate understanding of quantum computing and a concerning lack of preparedness for PQC implementation (average score of 2.4 out of 5). While common security measures like access controls and encryption were widely implemented, more advanced techniques and future-proofing strategies were lacking. The most frequent threats in the past year were phishing (65%), DDoS (47.5%), and social engineering (40%) attacks. A majority of respondents (57.5%) believe quantum computing will pose a significant threat within three years. Most respondents rated the potential impact of quantum decryption on stolen data as extremely high.&nbsp; <br><br>This study also developed a framework for PQC migration within the BFSI sector, considering data shelf life across the ecosystem. Key advantages of this framework include minimal disruption to existing infrastructure through support for hybrid implementation, straightforward deployment across various environments, and a future-proof architecture designed to counter evolving quantum threats. This framework facilitates the adoption of quantum-safe protocols while minimising disruption.&nbsp;<br><br>The study results also highlighted key recommendations for accelerating PQC adoption. Most of the CIOs/CTOs believe that government action needs to prioritise establishing clear guidelines and standards (45%), fund research and development (27.5%), and facilitate stakeholder collaboration (17.5%). Around 42.5% of the CISOs/CTO feel the need for cybersecurity awareness and education, as well as certification programs. Government-funded audits and research grants were equally favored as incentives for financial institutions to prioritise PQC (30% each). Additionally, the respondents highlighted the need for a government-defined migration timeline (45%) and guidance on algorithm selection (27.5%). Finally, for enhancing collaboration, a dedicated forum or working group was strongly recommended (42.5%).&nbsp;<br><br>The findings underscore the urgent need for immediate action to mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing. Recommendations include prioritising PQC migration, implementing robust key management practices, enhancing staff training, developing crypto-agile systems, and creating comprehensive data breach response plans. The results emphasise the urgency of developing and implementing a quantum-ready business model within the BFSI sector."}}

It was found that the average price invariance period was 19.5 days. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity in the frequency of price changes: food prices change more often than non-food ones, and the cost of services changes the least often. The observed price behavior confirms the implications of time- and state-dependent models. The dependence on time is indicated, for example, by the fact that the probability of price changes sharply increases by days 335 and 353 of their invariability. This fact reinforces the conclusions on the presence of seasonality in price changes found in a number of foreign studies. The analysis also suggests that, in March–May 2020, growth in uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic led to firms beginning to change prices more often and by a smaller magnitude. As a result, the share of price increases went up from 50.2% in March–May 2019 to 62.7% in March–May 2020. The number of days in which prices for any goods and services increased rose from 65 to 84 (out of 92 days in March–May). Thus, the results of this paper confirm that pricing behavior on the e-commerce market can vary significantly depending on economic conditions."}}

The economic welfare and unemployment shock are an upshot of the pandemic, lockdown, and oil price shock effect. The SVAR model estimation revealed that oil price shock mirrors a change in the price of oil due to an unanticipated change in the oil market. The results also indicate that an increase in oil prices affect economic welfare and unemployment positively before the pandemic and negatively due to the lockdown, restrictions on economic and social movement, increase in the number of death and confirm cases. The impulse function analysis also revealed a reverse effect of oil price and covid-19 shock on unemployment and economic welfare.

While relatively little attention has been paid to the CO2 emissions associated with the injection process itself. Previous studies have indicated that CO2 emissions resulting from exergy consumption during CO2 injection can account for 10% of the total amount injected, posing substantial obstacles for low-carbon development in oilfields. A notable contribution of this study is the incorporation of CO2 emission from exergy consumption into multi-objective-optimization framework. This emission metric is considered alongside cumulative oil production, CO2 storage capacity and net present value (NPV) to achieve collaborative enhancement of both recovery efficiency and environmental performance. To improve predictive accuracy, an ensemble learning approach combining deep neural networks (DNN) and support vector machines (SVM) together. Further reveal the compromise relationships among objectives though bi-objective and multi-objective optimization, and a novel application of the linear weighting method is employed to score Pareto-optimal solutions, enabling the identification of optimal compromise scenarios. Results show that compared with the original development strategy, the best-scoring solution achieves a 37% increase in cumulative oil production and enhances CO2 Storage by 38.43 million tons. Moreover, CO2 emissions per kilogram of CO2 injected are reduced from 0.053kg to 0.029kg, achieving a 45% reduction. The net present value (NPV) also increased by 48%. The proposed optimization strategy not only improves oil recovery and storage performance but also significantly reduces energy-related emissions, offering a promising pathway toward low-carbon and efficient field development."}}

Prior research often assumes independent fund failures due to the complexity of modeling high-dimensional correlation structures. This paper introduces a parsimonious factor-based framework that captures co-failure patterns among Funds of Funds, proxied by each fund’s proximity to performance-tiered hedge funds. The resulting distance ratio acts as a shared factor reflecting exposure to common failure channels while maintaining economic interpretability.Monte Carlo simulations show that ignoring such interdependencies biases hazard model estimates, while incorporating the shared factor yields consistent results. Empirical analysis reveals that alignment with underperforming funds predicts higher liquidation risk, whereas proximity to stronger performers correlates with survival and superior ex-ante returns. The framework enhances out-of-sample forecasting accuracy and offers policy-relevant insights for managing systemic risk in financial institutions."}}

The presumption of innocence applies to any proceeding that may result in the imposition of fines, which includes the 'beyond any reasonable doubt' standard of proof. The demanding 'beyond any reasonable doubt' standard in conjunction with a substantive test based on an assessment of the conduct's effects in any single case leads to long decisions and lengthy proceedings binding up resources. In turn, opting out of the power to impose fines at the start of the procedure allows for a less strict standard of proof, which might shorten proceedings.

Our extensive experiments (evaluating state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets) confirm CEI&apos;s superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods fall short. Furthermore, we present CEIA, an automated version of the metric that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application.

Thus, individuals with strong family ties tend to substitute the costs of investing in financial literacy with increased consumption or savings. The result is a sub-optimal financial literacy level for individuals with strong family ties, whom get a lower return on savings, which requires them to optimally save more. The model drives our empirical approach to analyzing the effect of family ties on financial literacy and its joint effect on financial behavior. Using micro-economic panel data, we find strong support for the model’s predictions: a strong level of family ties shows a significant negative effect on financial literacy and, consequently, on financial behavior, measured by savings, investment in complex financial instruments, wealth, and debt accumulation."}}

We employ a difference-in-differences specification by using a panel dataset covering counties along 20 major rivers from 2001 to 2013. The results show that EID exacerbates transboundary pollution. Specifically, following EID implementation, the most downstream county of a province emits approximately 40% more water pollutants than otherwise identical counties. The underlying mechanism appears to be more lenient enforcement of environmental penalties in these downstream counties due to EID pressures. Our analysis also reveals that this exacerbation of transboundary pollution is driven by the relocation of water-polluting firms from one county to downstream counties, rather than by an increase in newly established firms or higher pollution emissions from incumbent firms. This paper highlights an unintended consequence of EID, specifically the distortion of pollution activity distribution across regions."}}

Second, the COVID-19 experiment provides limited evidence on the stress test effectiveness in detecting individual bank resilience to tail risks during extreme events. Third, the Covid-19 experiment also reveals that even the occurrence of a major shock does not significantly affect ST result persistence suggesting that regulators are cautious yet responsive when updating stress test design and implementation in the aftermath of a disruption. Overall, the European experience suggests that expectations regarding the informative value of stress testing banks should remain positive but tempered."}}

Yet, limited academic attention has been given to the distinct effects of each ESG component on firms’ financial outcomes, particularly within specific industries. This study focuses on the extractive and mineral processing sector to evaluate the isolated impact of ESG dimensions on portfolio performance. Utilizing financial and sustainability data from Refinitiv and ASSET4 for 2017-2021, we implement a portfolio optimization model based on the Glue VaR risk metric. Two algorithms were applied: the Active-set method for Quadratic Programming (QPA) and Multi-pass Iteration Particle Swarm Optimization (MIPSO). Results indicate that QPA consistently outperforms MIPSO in producing portfolios with better risk-return trade-off. The QPA-optimized portfolio achieved a risk range of [0.034909, 0.037026] and a return range of [0.00086, 0.001519], with performance differences statistically significant (p < 0.001). Furthermore, statistical analysis shows that the Environmental (E) component exerts a stronger and more significant influence on financial outcomes compared to the Social (S) and Governance (G) components. These findings fill a critical gap in ESG literature by providing a disaggregated analysis of ESG dimensions and their financial implications. The study offers practical insights for investment strategies in ESG-sensitive industries, suggesting that investors in the extractive sector should prioritize environmental metrics to enhance risk-adjusted returns. This recommendation is specially relevant for institutions integrating ESG criteria into capital allocation and portfolio design."}}

In this framework, the state first sets the decriminalization threshold and penalty level, while the dealer later chooses the profit-maximizing drug quantity. The subgame perfect Nash equilibrium yields several key implications: the optimal threshold should always exceed average personal consumption, whilst penalties must remain harsh. In light of the theoretical result, the current methamphetamine threshold of 0.02 grams in Thailand should be increased by at least sixtyfold to approximately 1.2 grams, an amount on par with standards in Canada, the Czech Republic, and Portugal."}}

We find that, regardless of the size (value or quality) of the innovation, the patentholder prefers sale (to a single firm which further licenses the innovation to the competitor by means of pure ad-valorem royalty) rather than licensing. Relative to the pre-innovation context, sale increases overall welfare, although it does not always benefit consumers. However, licensing may be a socially superior strategy than sale, depending on the size of the innovation. This leaves room for the regulator to intervene in technology transfers to the productive sector."}}

Following the UK Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Pitt v Holt and Futter v Futter, which significantly restricted the judiciary's ability to void trustee decisions under the Rule, seven IFCs (Jersey, Bermuda, The Bahamas, the Dubai International Financial Center, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands) enacted statutes to preserve and clarify the Rule within their jurisdictions. These legislative actions highlight the strategic adaptations by IFCs to enhance their legal frameworks and maintain a competitive edge in providing sophisticated trust services. By codifying the Rule, these jurisdictions have addressed key criticisms of the common law version, ensuring greater certainty, flexibility, and protection for trust beneficiaries. The Article argues that this evolution exemplifies the positive role of jurisdictional competition in improving legal services and facilitating international financial transactions, thereby contributing to the global economy."}}

Unlike traditional approaches that treat model specification as a static optimisation problem, Delphos represents a paradigm shift: it frames this specification challenge as a sequential decision-making problem, formalised as a Markov Decision Process. In this setting, an agent learns to specify well-performing model candidates by choosing a sequence of modelling actions —such as selecting variables, accommodating both generic and alternative-specific taste parameters, applying non-linear transformations, and including interactions with covariates— and interacting with a modelling environment that estimates each candidate and returns a reward signal. Specifically, Delphos uses a Deep Q-Network that receives delayed rewards based on modelling outcomes (e.g., log-likelihood) and behavioural expectations (e.g., parameter signs), and distributes rewards across the sequence of actions to learn which modelling decisions lead to well-performing candidates. We evaluate Delphos on both simulated and empirical datasets, varying the size of the modelling space and the reward function. To assess the agent’s performance in navigating the model space, we analyse the learning curve, the distribution of Q-values, occupancy metrics, and Pareto fronts. Our results show that the agent learns to adaptively explore strategies to identify well-performing models across search spaces, even without prior domain knowledge. It efficiently explores large modelling spaces, concentrates its search in high-reward regions, and suggests candidates that define Pareto frontiers balancing model fit and behavioural plausibility. These findings highlight the potential of this novel adaptive, learning-based framework to assist in the model specification process."}}

In two online experiments (n = 1, 500), we elicit willingness to mitigate (WTM) by allowing subjects to delete actual CO2 allowances and examine how they allocate the WTM between their own and another's footprint. While 75% contribute a nonzero WTM, allocations are often inefficient, and many avoid freely available footprint information, suggesting limited efficiency concerns. Self-reported motives show that only half prioritize impact, while others cite fairness, personal responsibility, or intuition.

Successivamente, l’attenzione si è concentrata sul concetto di SupTech, inteso come utilizzo di tecnologie avanzate a supporto delle funzioni di vigilanza, attraverso una prima ricognizione delle principali sperimentazioni condotte da Autorità internazionali, europee e nazionali. In tale contesto, sono state esaminate in dettaglio le iniziative sperimentali avviate dalla CONSOB. Infine, dopo aver delineato i potenziali benefici e i rischi connessi all’impiego di tali tecnologie, le soluzioni SupTech sviluppate sono state analizzate alla luce dei requisiti che emergono dal quadro normativo vigente, al fine di coglierne le principali implicazioni e prospettarne possibili linee evolutive. <br><br><b>English abstract:&nbsp;</b>This paper explores the challenges linked to the use of artificial intelligence systems in CONSOB’s market surveillance activities.

We examine its integration with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), analyses the complementarity of both systems, evaluate its Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system, and present a multi-criteria regional comparison based on environmental, circular, and social standards. The steel sector serves as a case study to illustrate economic implications and the effectiveness of carbon pricing models. Our findings suggest that while CBAM can reduce emissions and encourage innovation, its fairness depends on careful implementation, support mechanisms for developing countries, and continuous alignment with international climate goals.Keywords: Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, EU ETS, Carbon Leakage, Environmental Fairness, Steel Sector, Monitoring and Verification, Climate Policy, Trade, Sustainability"}}

Our results show that temporary shocks to major crops due to disruptions to ecosystem services could raise food inflation by over 2 percentage points and headline inflation by 0.5 point, with most of the impact materializing over a one-to two-year horizon. Should such one-off events be repeated or intensified, they could generate more persistent inflationary pressures. Moreover, in France, disorderly and unanticipated implementation of restrictions on agriculture inputs could reduce GDP by 0.2% and raise relative prices of agriculture by up to 12% over the medium to long term. These results demonstrate that while nature degradation can increase inflation, a well-planned and coordinated transition would mitigate these effects more effectively than disorderly action or inaction. The paper also underscores key modelling gaps-such as limitations in capturing nonlinearities, feedback loops, and sectoral interdependencies-while supporting better integration of nature into macro-financial frameworks for central banks and regulators."}}

Surplus revenues flow into a constitutionally protected public trust—the National Future Fund (NFF)—separated from congressional appropriation authority.

Ethiopia has experienced recurrent food price shocks, often associated with global trends, domestic supply constraints and policy changes. However, limited empirical research has assessed the impact of these shocks on vulnerable populations, particularly, children. We employ the Fourier-based Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (FA-ARDL) model on time series data to capture both short-run and long-run effects, while accounting for potential structural breaks and cyclical variations. Our findings indicate that rising food price However, the study has several limitations. The reliance on available data may affect the generalizability of the findings, as the specific context of Ethiopia may not represent other countries. Additionally, the study does not account for other potential variables that could influence under-five child mortality, such as environmental factors, cultural practices, and healthcare quality. The models used, while robust, may not capture all the complexities of the relationships between variables. The use of FA-ARDL bounds testing, while powerful, has limitations in terms of its assumptions and potential biases. Furthermore, the study's time frame and data availability may not fully reflect long-term trends and changes. Future research should consider incorporating a broader range of variables, different methodological approaches, and longer time frames to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the determinants of child mortality. significantly increase under-five mortality, suggesting that food price instability has extensive health implications for children. Conversely, improvements in economic growth, government effectiveness, and reductions in out-of-pocket health expenditures were correlated with lower child mortality rates over time. These results underscore the importance of stabilizing food prices and strengthening institutions that ensure households' access to food and health services. We contend that integrated strategies, combining food system resilience, social protection, and investment in public health infrastructure, are crucial for reducing child mortality in low-income settings. By linking food price dynamics to child health outcomes from an econometric perspective, this study contributes to the expanding body of literature at the intersection of food security, governance, and human development.

This shift has been fueled by a combination of economic shocks, the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising geopolitical tensions. As a result, many countries are now rethinking their financial strategies, choosing to diversify their national reserves and engage in trade using local currencies through bilateral agreements. This paper explores how this trend is shaping economic and trade relations between the BRICS countries and the Arab states. With several Arab nations considering joining the BRICS bloc and already maintaining strong trade ties with its members, new possibilities for cooperation are emerging—especially in the context of reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar. A key player in this transition is the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB), which was founded in 2015 to finance infrastructure and sustainable development in emerging economies. Alongside this, the growing interest in digital currencies and electronic payment systems is creating new opportunities—and some challenges—for countries looking to reshape how they trade. This article delves into the main factors driving de-dollarization, examines how BRICS–Arab trade relations are evolving, and offers a critical look at the potential role of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and payment platforms like BRICS PAY in supporting a more diversified and resilient global trade environment.

We find that waiting periods reduce firearm suicides for men (-1.3 per 100,000), while the reduction for the overall population (-0.5 per 100,000), adults aged 55 + (-28.5 per 100,000), and white individuals (-23.1 per 100,000) was statistically insignificant. Waiting periods did not cause an increase in non-firearm suicides. The majority of confidence intervals were in the negative range, and the lack of statistically significant estimates does not mean that waiting periods did not cause a decrease in suicides. These findings provide some evidence that even brief delays in firearm access could disrupt the pathway from suicidal ideation to death, suggesting that cooling-off periods may be a crucial policy tool for suicide prevention."}}

Using data from Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA) 2021. It focuses on 7,530 rural households to identify key drivers of household livelihood and food security, as measured by household income and the Food Consumption Score (FCS) respectively. Panel regression analysis reveals that access to extension services, education, asset ownership, and land size positively influence household income, while subsistence agriculture and household disability have negative effects. Complementing this, ML models including logistic regression (Log), random forest (RF), ridge regression (Ridge), and gradient boosting (GBM) achieve over (92-93) % accuracy in classifying households' food security status. RF emerges as the best performer, highlighting critical predictors such as household income, food secure access, per capita consumption, dietary diversity (i.e.: Vitamin A, protein, and iron food compositions), and coping strategies. The findings underscore the importance of combining interpretable statistical techniques with powerful predictive tools to inform policy. Finally, the paper points to low adoption of irrigation and climate resilience practices, calling for targeted interventions to support transitions from on-farm to off-farm livelihoods and enhance rural welfare under increasing climate pressure."}}

The reason for this is the over-reliance on oil products as its main source of revenue. Due to the ineffectiveness of petroleum products as a means of income generation, the Nigerian government capitalised on taxes which is still inefficient. According to a report released by the Judicial Effectiveness Index in 2022, Nigeria ranks 119 out of 172 countries under the heading, Income Tax Rate. This ranking shows that Nigeria has not been able to effectively capitalise on tax as a means of revenue. Hence, the crux of this study is to explore the gap between tax policy and tax implementation in Nigeria. The doctrinal approach was adopted in this research as primary sources of law like the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act 2007 and secondary sources like textbooks, online journals, website publications as well as newspaper publications were utilized. This study found that there is a huge gap in Nigeria's tax administration system. The manuscript in conclusion asserts that active measures should be taken to effectively bridge this gap. Therefore, an effective tax collection system must be established, government wastages should be eliminated and stricter penalties for tax evasion should be put in place."}}

Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, the study reviews WTO's structures, principles, and policies, while applying economic and political theories like Neoclassical Liberalism, Comparative Advantage, and Neorealism. The paper identifies a growing power shift within WTO, with emerging economies like India and Brazil asserting stronger influence, but often not fully representing the interests of LDCs.&nbsp;The conclusion suggests that although WTO aims to create a level playing field, power politics, protectionism, and internal contradictions pose significant barriers. A more inclusive, transparent, and flexible approach—tailored to individual country realities—is necessary for meaningful global trade reforms."}}

While on the other hand, Milesi Ferretti has a significant negative effect on GDP growth. The RE model seems to be apt based on the Hausman test. However, I conducted the robustness checks using FE model for comparison and validation purposes. The robustness test concludes the absence of multicollinearity and presence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.

We find that competition does not lead to lower commission fees. The reason is that ad valorem fee setting implies a negative pass through of fees to app prices (Edgeworth paradox), which induces developers to adopt price parity across stores (without being required to do so by the integrated platform). As a result, consumers have no incentives to install third-party stores, and the integrated store becomes a natural monopoly. Eliminating default advantages through choice screens is unlikely to be effective. Allowing developers to steer consumers towards alternative subscription methods lowers commission fees and increases the number of apps, but also increases app prices, which may decrease consumer surplus."}}

Drawing on granular, confidential data for 139 banks, we estimate each bank’s economic net worth and find that unrealised losses on loans and bonds averaged around 30 per cent of equity. By September 2023, however, roughly half of these losses had been offset by gains from the deposit franchise and interest-rate swaps. We develop a theoretical framework linking banks’ economic net worth and deposit-rate setting to depositor behaviour and run incentives. Further results indicate that banks with larger unrealised lossesraised their deposit rates by less - a pattern we interpret as banks leveraging a more valuable deposit franchise to fund longer-duration assets. Although euro-area banks as a whole avoided widespread runs, several institutions nonetheless carried substantial mark-to-market losses, suggesting latent fragilities."}}

We model a CBDC that competes with bank deposits as a medium of exchange. Monopolistic banks issue deposits to lend to productive investment projects. CBDC does not lead to disintermediation, but it can distort bankers' investment decisions. To retain risk-averse depositors, banks need to compete with a risk-free asset (CBDC), which leads them to adjust their risk exposure and hold a safer loan portfolio. This can lead to overinvestment in risk-free (less productive) loans which is sub-optimal from a social point of view. If depositors are highly risk averse and risk-free projects are scarce in the economy, a CBDC that bears interest may lead to an overall welfare loss. Interest rate on reserves then becomes an important policy tool to crowd-out sub-optimal investment and mitigate banking sector risk."}}

As ambitious sustainability targets face funding challenges, the financial sector is tasked with channeling more private capital into sustainable investments. However, scaling sustainable technologies often requires investment in non-ESG-compliant assets. The mobility transition to electric vehicles, for example, demands increased supply of battery raw materials like Lithium, Cobalt, Manganese, and Nickel. This paper analyzes how ESG regulation impacts capital provision to mining companies supplying these materials. Concretely, we assess effects of the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and of the Taxonomy on banks’ public holdings and cost of capital, using two large, novel data sets. We find that the introduction of the ESG regulations has a dampening effect on banks’ holdings in battery raw material mining companies, in particular those with poor ESG performance. The companies’ cost of capital and lending behavior remain unchanged."}}

To what extent are the aversion to and distrust of algorithms rooted in a fundamental discomfort with giving up decision authority? Using two incentivized laboratory experiments across distinct decision domains, hiring (social decision-making) and forecasting (analytical decision-making), and decision architecture (nature and number of decisions), we elicit participants' willingness to delegate decisions separately to an AI agent and a human agent. This within-subject design enables a direct comparison of delegation preferences across different agent types. We find that participants consistently underutilize both agents, even when informed of the agents' superior performance. However, participants are more willing to delegate to the AI agent than to the human agent. Our results suggest that algorithm aversion may be driven less by distrust in AI and more by a general preference for decision autonomy. This implies that efforts to increase algorithm adoption should address broader concerns about control, rather than focusing solely on trust-building interventions."}}

This comprehensive review synthesizes empirical evidence from 54 developing economies and Ethiopia's unique socioeconomic context to evaluate anticipated impacts on domestic banking efficiency and economic resilience. The analysis reveals that foreign bank entry will likely catalyze substantial improvements in operational efficiency, technological innovation, and credit availability through competitive pressure and knowledge transfer. Concurrently, it may mobilize significant foreign direct investment, alleviate chronic foreign exchange shortages, and stimulate business formation in externally-financed sectors. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by substantial risks including market fragmentation favoring urban elites, small and medium enterprise (SME) financing gaps, domestic bank fragility, and heightened vulnerability to external financial shocks. Ethiopia's current macroeconomic instability-characterized by 33% inflation, liquidity constraints, and regional conflicts-amplifies these vulnerabilities.

Mechanism analysis reveals that, beyond the effects of urban income premiums, population density reduces consumption transaction costs and enhances social interactions, both of which encourage higher consumption. Additionally, population density raises non-housing consumption among some households by driving up housing prices."}}

We can view broadband through three philosophical lenses: utopian, dystopian, and neutral. Utopians see it as a democratizing force that empowers all. Dystopians warn that it can exacerbate existing inequities or fuel surveillance.

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, which enables electric vehicles (EVs) to both draw power from and supply power back to the grid, presents a particularly important opportunity to contribute to this goal. However, this technology faces legal and regulatory barriers in some EU Member States, including Spain. This article investigates the contribution of V2G technology to sector coupling and examines its potential participation in balancing markets, with a specific focus on the Spanish context. Balancing markets are technically well-suited for V2G participation, but Spain's current legislation presents significant barriers. While EU level regulations supporting the integration of V2G technology were introduced under the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package, Spain's delayed or incomplete transposition of these rules into national law continues to prevent V2G from entering the Spanish electricity balancing markets. The article analyzes the key legal and regulatory factors behind this limitation, particularly the market design favoring large-scale centralized production and the absence of a legal framework for independent aggregators. Nevertheless, it concludes that recent and ongoing legislative developments in Spain offer promising signs that these obstacles may be removed in the near future. This analysis is limited to legal and regulatory aspects and does not address technical, economic, or social dimensions of V2G deployment, which are also critical to achieving full integration."}}

However, the use of Gaussian priors for last layer weights in BLL models limits their ability to express complex distributions, especially when dealing with non-Gaussian, outlier-rich, or high-dimensional datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that combines diffusion techniques with implicit priors for variational learning of Bayesian last layer weights. This method replaces traditional Gaussian weight priors with more flexible, neural network-parameterized implicit distributions, allowing for greater expressiveness in modeling complex data. Additionally, we leverage the flexibility of diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to perform posterior sampling, introducing a novel objective function that captures the intricate dependencies and correlations among latent variables. This framework enables the explicit derivation of a variational lower bound for the marginal likelihood function, achieved through KL divergence minimization, which improves both posterior estimation and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on various tasks, including regression,⋆ The work is supported by the Fundamental Research Program of Guangdong, China, under Grant 2023A1515011281."}}

In response, this paper introduces a Blockchain-based secure Trusted Cluster (BTC) model that integrates blockchain technology with a comprehensive multi-tier trust evaluation framework. The proposed architecture delineates a three-layered approach: a data collection layer that initiates trust assessments based on data integrity and interaction metrics; an edge layer that employs router reliability and service path integrity to pre-process and securely route data; and a cloud layer that consolidates and immutably records trust scores via blockchain consensus mechanisms. By fusing direct trust—derived from time-decayed interaction and rating analyses—with indirect trust obtained through recommendations from credible nodes, the BTC model effectively mitigates a spectrum of security threats, including selective forwarding, data tampering, on-off behavior, good mouth and bad mouth attacks. Extensive simulations leveraging real-world SIoT datasets demonstrate that the BTC model significantly enhances malicious node detection rates by up to 5% while concurrently reducing the computational cost of trust evaluations by as much as 6.8%. These findings underscore the potential of blockchain-integrated trust frameworks to fortify the security, scalability, and reliability of SIoT networks in dynamic edge-cloud environments."}}

As the mainstream PRE technique, network trace-based PRE methods utilize various protocol features (e.g., specific features or universal features) to identify fields and their semantics. However, the inherent limitations of these features consequently constrain the performance of these PRE methods, compromising their generalizability or effectiveness. To address this, we propose an Extensible Protocol Reverse Engineering Framework Based on Multi-objective OPtimization (ExMOP) that flexibly incorporates multiple basic feature rules while synergistically integrating their complementary advantages to enhance protocol field segmentation performance. Each basic feature rule can be easily formalized as an optimization objective function, transforming the protocol field segmentation problem into a constrained multi-objective optimization model. We employ the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to solve this model, deriving the optimal field segmentation strategy. Ultimately, we conduct comprehensive experiments on publicly available datasets of multiple Internet protocols and industrial protocols.

Most common approaches—including Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and network-level analysis—are evaluated for their coverage and limitations in mobile-specific contexts. The review identifies a disconnect between current penetration testing tools and the proactive, secure-by-design posture promoted by standards such as OWASP MSTG and MASVS. A key theme is the divergent architecture of Android and iOS: Android’s open ecosystem supports in-depth testing through root access, emulation, and instrumentation, while iOS’s tightly controlled security model enhances baseline protection but significantly restricts third-party assessment. The study highlights the limitations of emulators, tool fragmentation, and the lack of platform-agnostic methodologies. Emerging opportunities such as DevSecOps integration, Mobile Device Management (MDM) frameworks, Apple’s Security Research Device initiative, and evolving cross-platform tools suggest future directions for more holistic and ethical testing practices. The review concludes that hybrid, cooperative, and policy-aligned testing strategies are essential to closing current methodological gaps and advancing mobile application security.    Index Terms: penetration testing, mobile application security, Android, iOS, OWASP MASVS, mobile testing tools, DevSecOps, application vulnerabilities."}}

The approach addresses critical limitations in existing methods: k-anonymity schemes leak partial hash information that can increase attack success rates by an order of magnitude, while cryptographic protocols like Oblivious PRF (OPRF) impose significant computational overhead. The proposed scheme employs deterministic noise generation to obfuscate Bloom filter queries, preventing servers from inferring passwords while maintaining the efficiency of Bloom filter lookups. Analysis demonstrates that deterministic noise provides superior privacy guarantees compared to random noise, particularly against correlation attacks over multiple queries. Experimental evaluation shows that the scheme achieves sub-millisecond query times with minimal bandwidth overhead (typically under 1KB per query) while providing strong privacy guarantees. The proposed method is particularly suitable for integration into password managers, authentication systems, and enterprise security infrastructure."}}

This paper presents a novel distributed learning system that uses graph-based neuronal network patterns to intrude detection of distributed IoT environments without data leakage. IoT networks are seen as graphs in this system, where each device represents a node and the communication links become the edges, thus allowing the neural models to grasp the complicated attack patterns as well as the structural relationships. We develop and evaluate six graph-based neural architectures, including convolutional, attention-based, and spectral methods, within the scope of a distributed learning setting so that multiple IoT sectors can work together to train detection models with no need to exchange sensitive information. Experimental results on synthetic IoT network data show that different models are optimal for detecting specific types of cyberattacks. The spectral convolution model performs best in detecting data exfiltration and unauthorized access, while the graph convolution model trained under a non-independent data distribution achieves top performance in detecting denial-of-service attacks. The attention-based model performs best for identifying malware propagation in a centralized setting. Overall, the proposed framework provides strong detection performance while enhancing privacy and reducing communication overhead. This research offers a practical, forward-looking solution for securing IoT heterogeneous systems on a broad spectrum of threats."}}

Traditional pavement maintenance prioritization approaches often rely on fragmented decision criteria and lack explicit knowledge representation frameworks, limiting their scientific reliability and scalability for network-level applications. Thus, this study integrated geographic information system (GIS) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to develop a knowledge-driven decision support model for highway pavement maintenance prioritization. Eight decision-making factors were identified considering engineering, environment, economy, and society to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the decision. The geographic information system was applied to process the multi-source heterogeneous information and spatial data for the eight factors, and TODIM was applied to rank the maintenance priority of pavement sections based on the preferences of decision-makers. Finally, the proposed GIS-MCDM model was applied to an existing highway network in Gansu Province, China, along with a traditional approach for comparative analysis. According to the result, compared with the traditional method, the proposed decision support tool can improve the decision-making process of policy makers and practitioners to be more rational and justifiable in managing and maintaining their highway infrastructures, to be more sustainable for the public."}}

Urban traffic resilience plays a vital role in daily transportation systems. Cities face increasing challenges from disruptions such as traffic congestion caused by construction, accidents, and major public events. To enable effective urban mobility planning, it is essential to forecast these disruptions and assess how quickly transportation systems can recover. A novel approach to predicting urban traffic resilience is introduced using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with integrated social event data. Urban traffic networks are modeled as dynamic graphs, which serve as simplified representations of traffic infrastructure. In these graphs, nodes represent critical locations such as intersections and roads, while edges indicate connections, including road links and traffic flow. Real-time data from sources such as mainstream media, social media platforms, and event planning systems is incorporated. This allows for consideration of disruptions caused by public events including concerts, protests, and sports gatherings, all of which have significant effects on traffic conditions. This method enhances the prediction of traffic congestion, recovery durations, and system adaptability. An advanced tool for urban traffic management is thereby provided. The model has been evaluated using real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting disruptions and offering strategies for improving traffic flow and resilience."}}

It starts from the premise that the garment sector has greatly benefited the people and the economy of Bangladesh.

Dal punto di vista normativo, il fenomeno è stato disciplinato nel nostro Paese già dal 2013, almeno per la parte relativa agli investimenti in equity, mentre a livello europeo una regolamentazione completa e omogenea è stata introdotta solo nel 2020 dal Regolamento (UE) 2020/1503, entrato in piena applicazione nel novembre 2023. Il presente lavoro approfondisce le opinioni e le leve che muovono i diversi attori del settore, ossia imprese, investitori e gestori di portali di crowdfunding. L’indagine ha previsto il ricorso a strumenti di analisi differenziati, sia di tipo qualitativo sia di tipo sperimentale. Le evidenze raccolte tra dicembre 2022 e gennaio 2023 nell’ambito delle indagini qualitative mostrano che gli elementi incentivanti o disincentivanti del ricorso al crowdfunding sono numerosi e afferenti a molteplici sfere, non solo di tipo funzionale e strategico ma anche di tipo attitudinale e culturale. Inoltre, la survey rivolta ai gestori di portali mostra un comparto, consapevole dei propri punti di forza e di debolezza, che si sta preparando a cogliere le opportunità derivanti dal mutato quadro normativo e a gestirne gli eventuali aspetti critici. Le evidenze dell’analisi sperimentale utilizzata per approfondire il processo decisionale degli investitori retail nell’ambito dell’equity crowdfunding mostrano, infine, come questi ultimi diano maggior peso a informazioni quali la presenza di altri investitori (professionali e retail) nella campagna o l’impegno diretto dell’imprenditore, valorizzando pertanto le informazioni disponibili <br><br>In questo quadro, tra le possibili leve attivabili per dare impulso all’ulteriore sviluppo del settore rientrano gli incentivi fiscali rivolti a investitori e imprese nonché misure volte a favorire le possibilità di smobilizzo degli strumenti oggetto di campagne di crowdfunding.

The phenom-enon has been regulated in our country since 2013, at least insofar as equity investments are concerned. At the European level, however, a comprehensive and uniform regulatory framework was only introduced in 2020 by Regulation (EU) 2020/1503, which came into full application in November 2023. This paper examines the opinions and levers driving different actors, namely enterprises, investors and crowdfunding service providers. The study employed a range of differentiated analysis tools, including both qualitative and experimental techniques. The evidence gathered between December 2022 and January 2023 through qualitative analysis indicates that drivers and deterrents of crowdfunding are several and heterogeneous. In detail, they refer to functional and strategic aspects, as well as attitudinal and cultural considerations. In particular, the survey addressed to crowdfunding service providers revealed a sector that is aware of its strengths and weaknesses and is prepared to seize the opportunities deriving from the new regulatory framework and to manage any challenges. Finally, the results of the experimental analysis used to investi-gate the decision-making process of retail investors in equity crowdfunding show that they place greater importance on specific pieces of information, such as the participation of other investors (both profes-sional and retail) in the campaign or the direct commitment of the entrepreneur.&nbsp;<br><br>In this context, crowdfunding sector could be further developed thanks to tax incentives for in-vestors and enterprises, as well as measures to facilitate the divestment of financial instruments related to crowdfunding campaigns. Information and knowledge continue to play a key role in the sector’s growth, as they have the potential to affect some of the cultural barriers that are among the most pervasive deter-rents to accessing this funding and investment channel."}}

Existing guidelines, based on expert opinion, do not optimize the trade-off between detection and cost, and overlook patient heterogeneity. We address this by designing cost-effective, clinically interpretable surveillance strategies for both the overall population and stratified subgroups.&nbsp; <br><br>Methodology/results: We formulate the surveillance problem as a constrained partially observable Markov decision process (CPOMDP). To balance personalization with practical implementation, we stratify patients into clinically meaningful subpopulations and solve a multi-model CPOMDP. By applying a Bayes-adaptive aggregation method, we transform the challenge of optimizing decisions over a semi-Markov disease model with structural model uncertainty into a tractable single-model POMDP. Applying our framework to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, we demonstrate that integrating circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with imaging not only improves clinical performance, reducing false positives by an order of magnitude compared to current guidelines and preserving treatment timeliness, but also delivers major economic value, with potential savings of up to 300 million annually in the U.S. Importantly, the recommended surveillance policies are simple and clinically feasible, consisting of fixed ctDNA testing schedules and selective use of imaging for localization after a positive result. To support targeted implementation, we also provide optimized schedules for six clinically relevant subpopulations defined by cancer stage and smoking history.&nbsp; <br><br>Managerial implications: Data-driven, decision-analytic surveillance strategies can outperform current guidelines, offering interpretable and practical policies that better align with clinical intuition and resource constraints."}}

Thus, various frameworks in decision making (such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process, DELPHI Method, Cynefin Framework, Decision Matrix Analysis, SMART, and MAUT, among others) were conceptually reviewed and found to be capable of supporting managers in resolving complex decision problems. The survey approach allowed the study to utilize primary data sources (mainly structured interviews and questionnaires) to retrieve pertinent data from managers of the ten randomly selected and notable enterprises in Nigeria. With the employment of T-Test Statistics in SPSS (ver. 25), the study found that there is limited familiarity and application of aforementioned advanced decision-making frameworks by managers of business enterprises in Nigeria-who instead were majorly familiar with the application of conventional decision approaches such as SWOT, PESTLE, et cetera. This explains the recommendation proffered by the study-for the sponsorship of business managers to on-thejob training, such as courses, workshops, conferences, seminars, webinars, symposiums, and other professional decision skills training, especially on those that would train and polish their skill on modern utilization of advanced decision making frameworks for solving decision problem in a complex environment."}}

This article also assesses the adequacy of legal responses at both the EU and national levels in addressing these distortions, arguing that, to effectively restore an “equitable” price, supervisory authorities should take into account any additional benefits granted to the seller of the controlling stake.

Our findings support the model, showing that CAPM beta significantly explains excess returns in African markets, with statistically significant coefficients and high t-statistics across all markets. However, consistent with the argument for its extensions, multi-factor models outperform CAPM in terms of adjusted R2 and economic significance, particularly in Nigeria and South Africa. The inclusion of liquidity and consumption factors yields mixed results, offering partial support for inclusion of liquidity and consumption data in asset pricing. Model stability varies across markets, with the Fama-French 5-Factor model demonstrating the most consistent performance. These results underscore the evolving nature of asset pricing in emerging markets and highlight the need for context-specific model adaptations. The study contributes to the literature by providing robust cross-market evidence and reinforcing the relevance of multi-factor frameworks in capturing the complexities of African equity returns."}}

First, we document the effect of a large, systematic monetary tightening (ECB rate increases from 0% to 4.5% during 2022-23), with average firm-level innovation cuts of 20%. These cuts persist over the medium term, indicating a sustained innovation slowdown. Second, we use the survey to identify elasticities of innovation expenditure to exogenous policy rate changes. Responses to hikes and cuts are significant and largely symmetric at the baseline rate (4.5%), though we detect potential state-dependent asymmetry due to the extensive margin. The financing channel emerges as one of the transmission channels, with more pronounced effects in firms with higher shares of bank loans and variable-rate loans. Crucially, we show that monetary policy transmits via aggregate demand, with stronger responses in firms with pessimistic demand expectations. Forward guidance provides substantial additional stimulus by reducing uncertainty about future rates, suggesting long-term, supply-side effects of announcements. These results challenge monetary long-run neutrality and are suggestive of policy endogeneity of R∗ operating through innovation-driven technology growth."}}

Present approaches seldom consider the intricate and multi-scaling dynamics of urban energy requirements specially during the Peak and Off-peak periods, resulting in inefficiencies and potential overloading of energy systems. To solve this, this study proposes a hybrid 1D-CNN-LSTM model to forecast short to medium-term electrical load across three critical daily interval such as Day Peak, Evening Peak and Off-Peak in urban context. Besides most existing models that focus on short-term forecasting (typically 24-72 hours), this hybrid model demonstrates robust accuracy in both peak and off-peak load predictions up to 7 days in advance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (CNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer-LSTM), achieving the highest forecasting accuracy with an R² of 0.95+ on day-ahead predictions and maintaining reasonable performance up to 4 days in advance. The model was also capable of accurately forecasting the intricacies in the load patterns of two other major metropolitan cities, proving its generalization capability. The key contributions of this research include a comprehensive correlation analysis, the development of an improved hybrid CNN-LSTM model interpreted with Integrated Gradients Attribution (IGA) approach for eXplainable AI (XAI), extensive lag value optimization and highly accurate short and medium-term energy demand forecasting across peak and off-peak periods. The proposed method enhances urban energy management by enabling more precise load forecasting, supporting smarter grid operations, improved reliability and progress towards sustainable energy systems."}}

This article addresses these issues by proposing a multi-factor, priority-based framework to optimize EV charging schedules in centralized charging stations. The methodology employs a day-ahead scheduling algorithm based on valley-filling technique to align charging during off-peak hours. A dynamic time-of-use (TOU) tariff is derived by integrating forecasted demand with the existing static tariff structure to incentivize off-peak charging. A priority factor is assigned to each EV based on key parameters including battery capacity, anticipated travelling distance, required SOC increase and overall energy need. EVs with higher priority factors are given precedence during overloaded conditions. To resolve overloading, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimally allocate EVs for discharging providing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations. If V2G is insufficient, a priority-based shifting mechanism reassigns lower priority vehicles to adjacent slots.  EVs that cannot be accommodated are deferred to the next scheduling cycle ensuring fair resource allocation. Simulation results incorporating 50 vehicles for charging and 10 for discharging validate the proposed approach. The dynamic TOU tariff successfully shifts charging demand to off-peak hours while priority-based reallocation meets critical charging needs.  Additionally, the average-to-peak demand ratio improves from 70.68% to 97.4% indicating enhanced load profile and resource utilization. Overall, the proposed methodology offers a technically robust and user-centric solution for EV charging optimization offering a scalable, adaptive and sustainable model for large-scale EV adoption in smart grids."}}

Grounded in social exchange theory, this research argues that ethical governance is not merely contextual but a constitutive element of reciprocity in AI-mediated interactions. Employing a two-study design, including a scenario-based experiment and a cross-sectional survey, this research reveals that while reciprocity and each FAT principle positively impact willingness to share personal information, their influence on intention to co-create value and perceived algorithmic legitimacy is largely indirect. The findings show that willingness to share personal information serves as a key mechanism linking these governance cues to downstream outcomes and exerts a direct, robust effect on perceived algorithmic legitimacy, highlighting voluntary information sharing as a legitimacy-conferring act. Moreover, high personalization of AI interactions amplifies the effect of fairness on willingness to share personal information. This research extends social exchange theory by integrating ethical governance into the structure of AI-mediated interactions and advancing a bottom-up view of legitimacy rooted in consumer agency. The research offers strategic insights for designing AI systems that align personalization with ethical safeguards to and responsible data-sharing, algorithmic legitimacy perceptions and co-creation intentions."}}

A Hierarchical Topology Mapping Model (HTMM) is introduced to deconstruct the spatial semantic hierarchy of part functional elements, thereby eliminating ambiguity in Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) specifications. A KRP-centric hierarchical architecture (Component Layer - Feature Layer - Point Cloud Layer - Datum Layer) is established, integrating manufacturing process rules, structural constraints, and dimensional specifications to enable the automatic generation of quantifiable datum constraints. Furthermore, a KRP-based dimensionality reduction mapping and X-core joint reasoning mechanism is developed to support cross-platform/cross-model part datum generalization. Engineering validation demonstrates that the KRP topological correlation matrix and parametric rule transfer mechanism improves the datum design quality of body side outer panel by 4.5%, achieve 100% fulfillment of core engineering constraints in datum generalization reasoning for geometrically variant components, enhance knowledge transfer efficiency by over 85%, maintain zero defect occurrences in datum design quality.

These negative spillovers suggest that poor gender equity practices among influential customers can propagate inequality across supply chains. We demonstrate that a customer’s GPG awareness shapes a supplier’s executive GPG through strategic adjustments in leadership representation to align with perceived gender equity expectations. To establish causality, we exploit the staggered implementation of gender pay transparency policies across Europe as quasi-natural experiments. Our findings confirm that customer pressure drives GPG convergence within supply chains, but also reveal that cultural and geographic proximity can constrain or intensify these effects, particularly those associated with downward influence."}}

The creation of the PCAOB in SOX followed from the failure of self-regulatory bodies to preserve quality audits for US public companies. The requirement that PCAOB-supervised auditors be retained by broker-dealers was a direct result of the Madoff and Stanford scandals. The PCAOB plays a particularly important role in protecting US investors in China-based companies. Evidence from research on SOX finds that it improved audit quality and public market liquidity, and that the costs it imposed fell substantially after PCAOB modified audit standards in 2007. No evidence supports SOX impeding IPOs generally.</span>"}}

The article articulates how these frameworks sculpt the engagement model of Indian organisations, with a stronger emphasis on leadership, diversity, and workplace wellness. Scholars and practitioners have come to identify culturally adaptive approaches to leadership, specifically in terms of its ideological moorings as inspiration, collaborative, and hierarchical etiquette-based as a leading driver for employee engagement. Companies such as Infosys and the Tata Group show us how cultural diversity in HR practices (festival celebrations or learning multiple languages) leads to growth and bucket-loads of compliance. The paper also emphasises the necessity of using culturally suitable meters to measure engagement in order to fulfil what employees expect in various settings. In addition, it examines issues of implementation problems like natural human resistance to change in pyramids and the imperative of re-adjusting policies with a dynamic cultural milieu. With case study analysis and industry reports; it offers insights into design engagement practices that will work for Indian employees.

This study examines how a DT system can mediate environmental control in shared workspaces by facilitating group decision-making through recommendations based on environmental factors and collected user data and real-time visualizations and improving the transparency and explainability of the decision process. To explore group decision-making processes, we developed a DT system that visualizes occupant preferences, provides AI-driven environmental recommendations, and supports real-time user input. The tests involved 120 participants in controlled co-working simulations. Results show that DT systems can serve as versatile mediators by promoting consensus with explainable, data-driven suggestions; supporting group decision-making using both historical and real-time data along with AI recommendations; empowering users to share their needs via feedback loops; integrating various preferences into a shared sense of satisfaction; and allowing quieter individuals to voice their needs. Participants looked for the DT systems to serve as a reliable teammate, simplifying decision-making and making comfort adjustments more inclusive and efficient. This research highlights the potential of DTs to enable fair and transparent control of environments in co-working spaces, offering a new approach for designing DT systems that address social dynamics, foster equity, and improve individual satisfaction while achieving group consensus in shared settings."}}

While scenario-based stochastic optimization accounts for uncertainty in the energy bidding process, a higher level of certainty that a select flexibility bid can be delivered in real time is required for demand flexibility to be adopted and integrated into the operational planning of novel electricity markets as a trustworthy and reliable grid resource.To simulate realistic bidding behaviors from grid-interactive buildings, and to enhance the reliability of bid delivery, this work designed a stochastic building aggregator model participating in an energy and flexibility market. The aggregator, which optimally controls a portfolio of building energy storage assets, is capable of generating a quantity bid for the day-ahead markets that maximizes its profit. To ensure the flexibility bid can be delivered in the real-time market, a novel chance constraint using empirical cumulative distribution function was formulated into a nested structure to allow users to stipulate any delivery confidence in the problem formulation. A case study tested on a portfolio of three office buildings participating in the PJM market demonstrated that the model exceeded the target bidding confidence of 80% among the testing scenarios, and achieved almost as much revenue as the perfect information case. Analysis on the detailed TES operation also revealed correlation between available flexibility and weather, suggesting possibilities to estimate building flexibility more efficiently in stochastic optimization problems."}}

This study combines a battery market structure analysis with an extension of a techno-economic cost model to assess the impact of factory planning, location-specific factors, and policy instruments on lithium-ion battery production economics. While the political stability, the energy mix, and the financial incentives shape site attractiveness, a scenario analysis demonstrates that China’s cost advantage stems less from geographic location and more from lower material and equipment costs and superior production efficiency. Ramp-up delays are identified as a major cost risk, particularly in later stages, where weekly delays can add costs of $1M per GWh of annual output. Furthermore, different policy tools are compared, including direct per-kWh subsidies, investment-based payments, and import tariffs. Only sustained operating subsidies substantially reduce production cost gaps compared to China, while one-time incentives show limited impact.

This enables frequent and steep price promotions. While it has been shown widely that price promotions increase sales, at least in the short term, the effect of price promotions on consumers' product evaluations is less clear. We study this question in the context of mobile apps, where price variations are common. Specifically, we examine how price promotions in Apple's App Store affect consumer evaluations measured by subsequent star ratings. Our results suggest that consumers tend to evaluate the product less favorably during price promotions than before the promotions. We provide evidence suggesting that reduced prices increase the likelihood of attracting consumers with lower valuations. Despite the reduced price, the app still represents a poor fit to these consumers' tastes. As a result of the mismatch between a consumer's taste and product characteristics, consumers who purchased during the promotion rate the app less favorably. These findings highlight a potential downside of aggressive price promotions for digital products, suggesting that firms must closely monitor online product evaluations to mitigate any negative impacts.&nbsp;"}}

But for most, the numbers simply do not work out. This paper looks at estates under 50 hectares and explores why premiumization often leads to higher costs without matching returns. Based on auction data, policy reviews, and field conversations, it shows that unbranded bulk channels offer more stable margins, while direct-to-consumer models bring high marketing and logistics costs. It also highlights practical alternatives like cooperative branding and niche B2B partnerships. The goal is not to dismiss premium efforts entirely, but to show that small estates need more grounded, scalable strategies that actually work.</span>"}}

This study investigates the interplay of digital technology adoption, digital competencies, and organizational culture in shaping the performance of non-teaching personnel in Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs). Utilizing a quantitative research approach, data were collected from 319 non-teaching personnel across public HEIs in Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental, and Lanao del Norte through stratified and purposive sampling. This study utilized Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the relationships among variables and identify the best-fit model that explains personnel performance. The SEM analysis revealed that organizational culture (p&lt;0.05, beta=0.312) and digital competencies (p&lt;0.05, beta=0.533) have a significant influence on non-teaching personnel performance. On the other hand, organizational culture exerts the strongest influence on innovation (beta=0.922), digital competencies exerts the strongest influence on communication and collaboration (beta=0.843), and non-teaching personnel performance exerts the strongest influence on professional development engagement (beta=0.865). Although adopting digital technology was not directly significant, it indirectly influences personnel's performance by facilitating compatibility and ease of use through user-friendly digital tools. Also, data revealed that structural model-3 is the best fit model of public higher education institutions non-teaching personnel performance since the obtained value of the seven model fit indices used in this study are within the standard/good fit value range. The study reaffirms the resource-based view theory, emphasizing the strategic role of internal resources such as digital competencies and organizational culture. Based on the findings, SIGOD Personnel Performance Framework was developed, which emphasizes skills in the digital era, innovation in organizational culture, growth in professional development, optimization of performance metrics, and data-driven decision-making. Thus, the findings provide a valuable foundation for higher education institutions to implement strategic frameworks for workforce efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability."}}

This Comment focuses on Albuquerque, New Mexico’s recently enacted pedestrian-safety ordinance. The city enacted this ordinance after a 2021 Tenth Circuit ruling struck down a prior version of the ordinance for violating the First Amendment. The current median ordinance, like its predecessor, makes it illegal to sit or stand on certain street medians. This Comment examines whether Albuquerque’s current median ban constitutes a content-neutral, narrowly tailored “time, place, and manner” restriction under the First Amendment. Despite claims that the ban addresses a crisis of pedestrian fatalities, evidence shows the city’s ban does not serve a nonspeculative government interest by improving pedestrian safety. The ban also likely disproportionately restricts the rights of vulnerable populations. There is likely a lack of case-specific data showing that the ban positively impacts safety to a measurable degree that would justify such drastic infringement of the freedom of expression. In other words, the city’s law does not do what it purports to do while also imposing a broad speech restriction violative of the First Amendment.</span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a Comment on the intersection of constitutional rights, road safety, and governance strategies. Instead of taking the path of criminalizing poverty, panhandling, and homelessness, legislatures at all levels of government should instead seek to address the root causes through measures like infrastructure improvements and affordable housing. But this Comment recognizes these solutions come with immense expense and thus recommends three stopgap measures that municipalities could feasibly implement: mobile outreach services, donation deflection programs, and day-labor initiatives. Legislatures in Albuquerque and in localities across America should take caution to avoid restricting the First Amendment rights of panhandlers, pedestrians, motorists, and, ultimately, everyone, through median bans that have little impact on public safety.</span></p>"}}
