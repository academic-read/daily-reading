Using data from Colombia between 2009 and 2017, we compute wage disparities by automation risk. We find that 62% of the occupied people in Colombia are at high-risk of automation. In the same way, we find that 71% of informal workers are at high-risk, while 56% of formal workers are. The wage return to education are highest in the less automatable occupations. We then look at the effects of actual education, measured by ICT investment. On wages and employment, automation increases employment, decreases wages and the wages gap by skill. Education acts as a protection mechanism against new automation technologies."}}

Using a combination of hedonic regression models and natural language processing techniques, including Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, and K-Means clustering, the analysis identifies key differences in pricing strategies, property characteristics, and the role of digital platforms in rental advertising. Findings reveal that advertised listings are skewed towards higher-end properties, with a greater prevalence of larger units and higher rental prices compared to the official register. Additionally, real estate agencies exhibit distinct pricing behaviours across platforms, with agency-listed properties on Facebook Marketplace generally featuring advertised rents that are between 1.5% and 2.9% lower than those posted by individual landlords. Moreover, P2P platforms usually contain a broader range of property types compared to those in aggregated agency listings. This suggests that agencies tend to use Facebook Marketplace to reach a wider audience, including lower-budget renters, while agency listings primarily cater to higher-end properties and a wealthier clientele, reflected in its higher average rental prices and greater concentration of premium listings. Linguistic analysis of property descriptions shows that comprehensive, high-quality phrasing increases rental asking prices by 3.7% to 10.2%, while the presence of specific quality-indicative words raises rents by 1.2% to 3.5%, with the range largely depending on the online platform on which an advert is posted. These findings underscore the importance of considering data source biases in rental market analysis and highlight the role of social media and platforms for real estate agencies’ listings in shaping rental market dynamics and price-setting behaviours."}}

Leveraging China's abrupt lockdown policies as a natural experiment, we examine the heterogeneous effects of online education on student academic performance. Using a panel dataset of 15,329 observations from 7,867 undergraduate students across nine Chinese universities over four semesters (Fall 2018 to Spring 2020), we compare academic outcomes before and during the transition to online learning. We find that online education led to an average increase of 8 to 11 points in mathematics scores on a 100-point scale during the pandemic. Applying principal component analysis, we identify four key policy measures that capture lockdown stringency: stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, public transportation suspension, and public information campaigns. Stricter stay-at-home orders issued by the government reduce the effectiveness of online learning; however, these negative effects are partially offset by increased parental supervision and reduced external distractions resulting from workplace closures and the suspension of public transportation. Further, online learning is more effective for reasoning-focused courses (e.g., mathematics) than interpretation-focused courses (e.g., English), and the academic benefits of face-to-face peer interactions diminish significantly in online settings relative to offline environments. Our findings offer actionable insights for managing educational delivery during operational disruptions, highlighting the importance of tailoring online curriculum design and support systems to course content and student mobility constraints."}}

We develop and evaluate training interventions to foster internet banking adoption in a field experiment with more than 25,000 elderly clients of a large German savings bank, of whom we randomize 333 into training. Our administrative banking panel data allows us to account for selection on observables and assess the sustainability of treatment effects. After the interventions, the share of clients who use internet banking increases by 26 percentage points in the treatment group relative to a matched control group. In terms of sustainable usage, the share of online transactions increases by 13 percentage points and remains elevated four months later. An extensive placebo analysis suggests that as much as 85% of the effect can be causally attributed to the training interventions. We find that training boosts non-technical adoption skills and reduces key adoption barriers. Treatment effects are larger for women and those not in charge of household finances. We further estimate intent-to-treat effects and predict dropout along the entire multi-stage adoption process to shed light on practical considerations when rolling out large-scale technology adoption interventions in this age group. Specifically, we show that the type of training (self-guided versus social learning) impacts dropout differentially despite similar treatment effects overall, with the social learning treatment being more inclusive.&nbsp;"}}

We identify nine essential leadership competencies for the digital age: fostering agility, championing an ethical culture, pursuing purpose-driven goals, maintaining technological competency, genuinely understanding diversity, demonstrating humility, exhibiting empathy, cultivating active listening, and creating cultures of appreciation and recognition. These qualities empower leaders to transform rigid organizations into adaptable powerhouses ready for anything. The paper argues that \"visionary myopia\"-a leader's failure to see threats and opportunities outside their traditional industry-is especially crucial."}}

The framework formalizes the role of AI as an integral part of creative processes, reflecting the natural tendency to incorporate new technologies into human activities. By introducing a cost minimization perspective, the model captures the transition of AI's role from generator to tool as complexity increases. Knowledge integration is quantified using Rényi entropy to assess diversity and structure. Experimental findings suggest that while AI extends the capacity to generate output, human involvement remains important in the critic process, particularly in evaluating creativity and innovation. This supports the view that AI complements, rather than replaces, human judgment in creative work."}}

This quantitative study was conducted on 404 respondents from a robotics marketing foundation using a structured questionnaire and examined through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings indicate that anthropomorphism and subcultural appeal significantly influence increasing utilitarian attitudes, while modification resistance and robot quality influence technological interaction.

Due to the intimate nature of the arrangements offered (home stay, car share), these markets critically depend on trust.

The positively skewed distributions put accuracy into question and consequently undermine the credibility of feedback. As social interactions are a key characteristic of sharing economy transactions, we examine whether the exchange of personal information between transaction partners influences customer feedback and whether this effect is conditional on interpersonal liking. Since the frequency and intensity of these social interactions cannot be directly observed in field settings, we designed a laboratory experiment that simulates a sharing economy market. This setting allows us to vary the availability of personal information and thus to directly compare the feedback behavior of participants who have access to that personal information with those who do not. Our results confirm the existence of a social premium: customers rate providers significantly higher when provided with personal information, regardless of whether their performance expectations are met. Furthermore, we find that interpersonal liking positively influences rating scores, revealing a mechanism through which social information affects feedback provision. We offer specific proposals that account for these social information effects, and which, by generating more dispersed and differentiated feedback, would benefit platform providers and market participants alike."}}

Following a PRISMAcompliant process, we classified cryptographic techniques, analyzed their reported privacy guarantees, computational and communication overheads, and identified practical implementation challenges.

Automation bias, defined as the tendency to excessively trust AI outputs while ignoring contradictory evidence or personal judgment, drives a three-phase cycle: (1) initial dependency development, fueled by perceived AI efficiency; (2) critical thinking atrophy via cognitive offloading; and (3) bias internalization and propagation, where AI biases are inherited and reproduced in human decisions, even without AI support (Kosmyna et al., 2025). Drawing on evidence such as the impact of AI on 40% of global jobs (Georgieva, 2024) and cognitive offloading in education (Kosmyna et al., 2025), we challenge the notion that technical fixes alone can mitigate these effects. We propose Wisdom as a Service (WaaS), a preliminary framework that integrates non-European wisdom traditions… This theoretical approach prioritizes epistemic pluralism and community validation as potential pathways to address the long-term societal consequences of AI over-reliance (inspired by Cleverly (2025), integrating non-European wisdom traditions (e.g., Ubuntu, Nyāya) and decolonized AI architectures to disrupt bias amplification). Automation bias is not just a human-AI interaction problem but a sociocognitive epidemic. Without systemic intervention (e.g., WaaS, decolonized AI), AI biases will become permanent fixtures of human reasoning. This framework prioritizes epistemic multiplicity, community validation, and culturally grounded reasoning to address the long-term societal consequences of AI over-reliance."}}

Moreover, the directionality of relations is frequently overlooked, thereby limiting the expressive power of models in capturing complex relational directions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel entity alignment framework named Directed Relation-Aware Representation Learning for Entity Alignment (DRAEA). Specifically, as a dual-module learning framework, DRAEA enables simultaneous and decoupled modeling of the entity structure and directed relational features. Furthermore, a direction-enhanced relation representation module is designed that constructs a line graph based on the directed relations in KG. This enables the model to learn the directional relational features explicitly. DRAEA achieves an end-to-end fusion of structural learning and relation modeling in a novel and effective method. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the best baseline by up to 1.69% in H@1 on DBP15K."}}

Results showed that as AI-human interaction fluidity was positively related to AI-use knowledge and humanoid robot acceptance, while mistrust and fear positively predicted perceived future AI displacement of human workforce.

Capturing the complex spatiotemporal atmosphere–land–hydrology interactions using deep learning remains challenging for accurate rainfall–runoff forecasting. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning framework, Runoff Forecasting Model Integrating Spatiotemporal Features (RFMISF), which leverages the complementary strengths of multiple deep learning architectures to construct five modules, thereby fusing multi-source data. Specifically, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks for extracting spatial features of underlying surface, LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies in rainfall and runoff, and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for learning spatiotemporal features of meteorological inputs. The proposed model was applied to daily runoff forecasting at BHT and SBY hydrological stations with distinct hydrological regimes. At BHT, RFMISF reduced RMSE by 13.7% and MAE by 24.7% compared to the LSTM baseline. At SBY, it improved NSE by 13.63% and decreased MAE by 16.19%. Ablation experiments further demonstrated the importance of multi-source data. The exclusion of station rainfall, underlying surface, and meteorological data led to RMSE increases of 9.29%, 4.69%, and 5.59% at BHT during flood season, respectively. At SBY, the corresponding reductions in NSE were 15.08%, 4.46%, and 12.94%. Additionally, model performance varies with rainfall intensity, indicating the differentiated contributions of multi-source data in complex runoff responses. Although reanalysis data enhance spatial representativeness, their systematic errors require careful treatment. Overall, this study introduces a novel, robust framework for enhancing runoff prediction and improving water resource management in hydrologically complex environments."}}

Many of these economically driven provisions and the changes that they trigger in domestic regulatory regimes have serious human rights implications. Some of the tensions, in particular around personal data protection, have found reflection in policy and academic discussions. The implications for other human rights have been however often ignored. It is the article’s objective to address this gap. First, by providing a detailed analysis of the current digital trade law framework, advanced through far-reaching treaties, such as the CPTPP and the USMCA and the new generation of Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs). Second, by exploring the human rights implications of selected provisions in more detail, starting with the more conventional discussion of privacy and then freedom of speech, and moving towards the less explored interfaces with development. The article’s overall enquiry seeks to feed into a more nuanced discussion of digital trade regulation and towards better interfacing of digital trade law with human rights.</p>"}}

In equilibrium, Discovery Mode can either benefit or harm the provider of the cheapest content to stream, with the harm arising whenever Discovery Mode threatens to revert preexisting bias against said provider.

In this study, we examine the optimal ratio of R&amp;D investment for economic growth, using panel time-series data spanning 33 years (1985-2017) for 72 countries, including both OECD member and non-member countries.

Previous attempts to measure the impact of a specific DMU involved evaluating overall system efficiency after removing that DMU. However, challenges arise in accurately assessing post-removal system efficiency primarily because the aggregate unit fails to represent the transformed system adequately. The lack of modification to the remaining DMUs results in a disparity between the average of the remaining DMUs and the previous aggregate unit. Consequently, calculating the overall efficiency of the new system using the previous aggregate unit becomes imprecise and lacks meaningful insight. We develop a new incentivization method involving the redistribution of the DMU under evaluation among the remaining units to maintain the representativeness of the aggregate DMU before and after the removal of the DMU under evaluation. We propose two models to calculate the maximum loss and gain for each inefficient and efficient DMU during this redistribution, respectively. Our method also demonstrates robustness when assessing the contributions of efficient DMUs in the presence of nearby masked units. We provide adaptations for inefficient DMUs near efficient ones but significantly distant from other groups of inefficient units, ensuring precise scoring. Our approach is demonstrated using a real dataset."}}

This study aims to analyze the influence of learning concentration on improving the quality of student human resources in the digital era, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and professional aspects. The research method used is a quantitative approach with a simple linear regression analysis technique to determine the relationship between variables. The results of the study show that learning concentration has a significant influence on the quality of student human resources, shown through improving critical thinking skills, good time management, academic discipline, and readiness to face the world of work. This study concludes that learning concentration is not only an important element in academic success, but also contributes to the formation of students' character, integrity, and competence holistically. Therefore, universities need to design learning strategies and academic support that can strengthen students' concentration skills in order to produce a generation of human resources who are ready to compete in the digital era."}}

However, this digital transformation is accompanied by complex policy challenges, particularly in regard to the taxation of corporate entities. It is evident that establishing a stable and well-organized international tax framework is essential to address the issues associated with taxing this digital economy and to earn the trust of all stakeholders involved. In response to these issues, the global tax community has initiated collective efforts to create a robust tax framework. This effort is reflected in the agreement reached by 138 countries on a two-pillar approach. Pillar One concentrates on establishing rules for nexus and profit allocation, while Pillar Two introduces a global minimum tax designed to mitigate the unresolved issues related to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). This approach is anticipated to foster equity and fairness in taxation and also empower international economies to adapt to evolving business models and profit realization tactics employed by multinational enterprises. Many of these entities have resorted to aggressive tax strategies and profit-shifting techniques in order to navigate the challenging financial eceonomy exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of the taxation frameworks for digital entities as outlined in the OECD Model Tax Convention. It also examines the design of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLC).

Among others, we examine how preferences relate across domains, map them onto socio-demographic characteristics, politics, support for policies, and gender wage gaps, and study underlying redistributive principles and effects of wage transparency."}}

It explores why firms restructure, highlighting triggers such as unsustainable debt, regulatory shifts, strategic refocusing, and pressures to unlock shareholder value. The study examines how firms execute these transformations through mergers, demergers, asset divestitures, debt refinancing, and organizational realignments. Covering ten prominent Indian cases (including Reliance Industries, Tata Group, Adani Group, HDFC-HDFC Bank, and JSW Steel) and five global counterparts (General Electric, Siemens, Vodafone, IBM, and Volkswagen), it assesses the restructuring processes and outcomes. Key insights reveal that high debt levels often precipitated asset sales and equity infusions, while conglomerate discounts led firms to spin off focused entities, enhancing valuations. Regulatory frameworks like India's Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) catalysed distress resolutions, as seen in steel and power sector turnarounds. Successful restructurings typically featured robust due diligence, clear communication, and meticulous post-deal integration. Conversely, weak governance and legal entanglements, exemplified by the Future Group's collapse, underscore potential pitfalls. Financially, many firms emerged leaner and more profitable. Reliance became net debt-free and diversified into digital and retail, while HDFC Bank's merger positioned it among the world's top banks by market cap. Yet, cases like Vodafone highlight that restructuring is not universally successful without sustained strategic and financial discipline. The study also underscores future research avenues, including long-term performance of spun-off entities and the growing role of ESG considerations in restructuring decisions. Recommendations are offered for corporates, finance practitioners, and policymakers to approach restructuring as a proactive strategic renewal tool, supported by rigorous financial modeling, transparent communication, and regulatory fine-tuning to protect stakeholder interests."}}

This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning-based method that combines a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and two consecutive transformer encoders for RUL prediction. The use of 1D CNN is to extract spatial features, while the transformer encoders are for capturing long-term dependencies from input sequences. A Fourier transform is integrated into the second transformer encoder to increase training speed and model lightness. In addition, a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is applied to find out the optimal hyperparameters of the model. Several experiments have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of BO and evaluate the performance of the proposed model based on two well-known turbofan engine datasets, namely the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System (C-MAPSS) benchmark dataset and its new version (N-CMAPSS). The results show that the proposed model performs better on accuracy and lightness than the current state-of-the-art RUL prediction methods."}}

SAPPO integrates these signals into the PPO advantage function via a sentiment-weighted term, enabling allocation strategies that respond to both price movements and market sentiment. Experiments on a three-asset portfolio demonstrate that SAPPO increases the Sharpe ratio from 1.55 to 1.90 and reduces drawdowns relative to PPO.

While commingling improves efficiency for both the platform and the sellers, it creates quality risks when sellers differ in product quality and this information is privately held. We develop a game-theoretic model of a platform that sets its fulfillment fee while sellers, differentiated by quality, decide whether to participate in commingling. We characterize the resulting equilibrium outcomes and uncover a form of market stratification: lower-quality sellers either avoid the platform entirely or join only by commingling, whereas higher-quality sellers always remain but in some cases may opt out of commingling to shield their customers from quality spillovers. We show that commingling consistently improves the profits of the platform and lower-quality sellers. However, it may hurt higher-quality sellers, even if they opt out: not through quality risk, but via the platform's endogenous increase of the fulfillment fee. Importantly, we identify market conditions where commingling improves outcomes for all parties. Our paper provides platform managers with a framework to evaluate when and how to offer inventory commingling. By pinpointing market conditions where commingling boosts profits, expands seller participation, or threatens product quality, we offer actionable guidance for aligning fulfillment design with strategic objectives."}}

Capturing the complex spatiotemporal atmosphere–land–hydrology interactions using deep learning remains challenging for accurate rainfall–runoff forecasting. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning framework, Runoff Forecasting Model Integrating Spatiotemporal Features (RFMISF), which leverages the complementary strengths of multiple deep learning architectures to construct five modules, thereby fusing multi-source data. Specifically, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks for extracting spatial features of underlying surface, LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies in rainfall and runoff, and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for learning spatiotemporal features of meteorological inputs. The proposed model was applied to daily runoff forecasting at BHT and SBY hydrological stations with distinct hydrological regimes. At BHT, RFMISF reduced RMSE by 13.7% and MAE by 24.7% compared to the LSTM baseline. At SBY, it improved NSE by 13.63% and decreased MAE by 16.19%. Ablation experiments further demonstrated the importance of multi-source data. The exclusion of station rainfall, underlying surface, and meteorological data led to RMSE increases of 9.29%, 4.69%, and 5.59% at BHT during flood season, respectively. At SBY, the corresponding reductions in NSE were 15.08%, 4.46%, and 12.94%. Additionally, model performance varies with rainfall intensity, indicating the differentiated contributions of multi-source data in complex runoff responses. Although reanalysis data enhance spatial representativeness, their systematic errors require careful treatment. Overall, this study introduces a novel, robust framework for enhancing runoff prediction and improving water resource management in hydrologically complex environments."}}

Our empirical analysis finds support for the latter. While we do uncover a strong direct effect of bribe payment on lowering the tax and fees by 27%, we find that payment of bribes also reduces the number of inspections and leads to indirect benefits of tax and fees reduction.

The impact of mismatch of current sources is reduced by introducing a dual segmentation strategy and local dynamic element matching (DEM). An 8:1 multiplexer (MUX) with edge-enhanced 1-UI pulse generator is proposed for high-speed data serialization, simplifying the clock generation circuit. In addition, the influence of the output network on the dynamic performance of the DAC is also analyzed. The proposed DAC prototype is designed based on the 28nm CMOS process. The post simulation results show that the proposed DAC achieves spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 37.20-dB and signal-to-noise and distortion (SNDR) of 30.91-dB at 96 GS/s sampling rate under the Nyquist output frequency. For eight level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-8) encoding, the 288-Gb/s eye diagram demonstrates 78-mV vertical eye opening and 0.253-UI horizontal eye width, achieving 0.52 pJ/bit energy efficiency of DAC core."}}

Meanwhile, autonomous agency has had an impact on human psychology and behavior. The aim of this research was to identify and evaluate the factors influencing the collaborative performance of human-automation teams (HAT) from a socio-technical systems perspective. Based on the results of the systematic review and meta-analysis, the study found medium effect sizes of automation design factors on collaboration task performance (hit rates). These factors included automation transparency, automation reliability, and autonomy level. They also had an impact on workload. Additionally, subgroup analyses showed that these design factors had differential effects on automation trust as well as situation awareness. The study also used a Bayesian network meta-analysis to demonstrate the influence of a wider range of design factors for HAT systems, highlighting the importance of automation transparency as well as automation reliability, and simultaneously indicating that integrating the multiple factors is necessary to improve HAT performance. The research identifies and evaluates the influencing factors of cyber-physical human systems, especially human-centered design factors in the systems, and provides theoretical support for the development of future intelligent industrial systems."}}

FGF machines face the challenge of inconsistent molten polymer flow due to feedstock clogging before the screw extruder. An automated system was developed to regularly break up feed line clogs using compressed air. Prolonged fluidization of particles in the feed line also causes failure to feed the extruder, so an approach of intermittent, or pulsed, fluidization was developed with most feeding by gravity between pulses. System operation is parametrized by air pressure, airflow, duty cycle, and pulse width. System performance was evaluated on a GigabotX 2 XLT Beta FGF machine for two feeding conditions with recycled poly(lactic acid) (PLA): 1) granules and 2) mixed granules with flakes. Using a fixed pulse width of 2 seconds, a full factorial experimental design was used to investigate the effect of three parameters (air pressure, airflow, and duty cycle) on polymer flow. The pressure and airflow settings that give stable fluidization differed little for the two feedstocks. For the mixed feedstock, a response model captured factor interactions with an R-squared value of 92%. Using optimized operating parameters of 30 psi (210 kilopascals), 3.5 CFM (5.9 cubic meters per hour), and 28.5% duty cycle, the FGF system operated for over 60 hours using mixed granule and flake feedstock without polymer flow discontinuities."}}

The prevalence of hallucinations in AI-assisted legal reasoning and the existed climate misinformation absorbed by large language models add to the uniqueness of this question. As AI-generated materials increasingly shape legal decision-making and knowledge acquisition, this issue becomes closely intertwined with the social construction of truth regarding what energy transition means in climate change mitigation. This Article sheds new empirical and theoretical light on this issue through an original study on fossil fuel corporate speech. We tested a controversial topic in energy practice: is the climate denialism from fossil fuels protected free speech or fraudulent advertising? Current large language models can distinguish honest speech from heavily advertised materials in knowledge-based law school teaching style questions. However, even prompted properly and inputted with abundant First Amendment Jurisprudence knowledge, current large language models showed low performance in (1) identifying well-known fossil fuel industry climate denial strategies; (2) choosing the proper test to scrutiny and reasoning in climate change denial scenarios. We argue that, outside the basic law school training, heavily relying on AI in fossil fuel corporate speech analysis is both doctrinally unreliable and impractical. When presented in polished legal language, these errors risk misleading non-specialist audiences and embedding biased assumptions into the shared doctrinal framework of climate law and attribution science. We further use these results to develop a theory of AI-assisted corporate speech analysis, which firstly calls for vigilance against AI-generated contents and assets that in the initial stage, the application of AI is likely to remain limited and segregated in separated and sequenced scenarios. We conclude reliable AI-enabled corporate speech analysis in energy sector will take time, as current models upgrade into a stage where AI could hold consistent values and the models themselves process findings from attribution science as well as legal research. Finally we offer a pragmatic method to develop curated legal analysis on this issue and a typology for potential AI-lead misunderstanding and deviations for future research."}}

Interestingly, the best-fitting model for South Carolina focused on a single subsequent year, suggesting the importance of timely, year-specific intervention strategies. Differences between observed and predicted vaccination rates were most evident in the counties of Charleston, Greenville, and Richland. These differences indicated the need for targeted strategies to address large discrepancies between predicted and observed vaccination coverage.Conclusions: Local-level predictive modeling can highlight county specific disparities missed by state or national data. By pinpointing areas with substantial gaps, public health officials and primary care providers can tailor interventions to improve vaccination coverage. This predictive modeling method can be replicated in areas with low vaccination coverage and limited data to enhance immunization efforts and ultimately strengthen public health outcomes and cancer prevention."}}

The review synthesizes current methodologies, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and interdisciplinary applications in multi-energy forecasting, while identifying gaps that hinder precision and adaptability in dynamic environments. Addressing these deficiencies, an innovative and versatile forecasting framework is proposed and designed to accommodate the diverse energy sources prevalent in building energy supply systems, such as electrical and thermal inputs. Central to this framework is the introduction of a novel hybrid machine learning model, specifically tailored for short-term energy consumption forecasting. This model integrates advanced deep learning techniques, combining Long Short-Term Memory networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Transformers with a broad spectrum of data inputs, including historical consumption patterns, weather forecasts, air quality metrics, indoor conditions, and newly proposed indicators like traffic load and transport speed as hypothetical influence factors. By prioritizing adaptability in the training process through a dynamic, iterative pipeline, the model ensures responsiveness to evolving energy use patterns, surpassing the limitations of traditional static approaches. Results from the systematic analysis and model implementation can demonstrate significant potential of improvements in forecasting accuracy and flexibility, enabling precise predictions for both electrical energy usage and thermal comfort requirements across various building types. This research introduces a practical, scalable solution for real-world energy management challenges, contributing to the broader goals of resource efficiency and sustainable development in urban settings."}}

An XGBoost regression framework is employed to predict rutting, texture depth, and longitudinal profile variance, demonstrating superior performance over a linear baseline for all deterioration metrics. Key findings are that the model accuracy approaches or exceeds the calibration sensitivity of the survey equipment, and that model training data and configurations are largely transferrable between failure modes. Shapely Additive Explanation analysis reveals the dominance of historic condition values for informing future predictions, whilst providing engineering aligned insights into the influence of subtle contextual factors, such as crossfall and traffic flows.

Despite tax reduction policies in China, many enterprises perceive a heavy tax burden, primarily due to tax stickiness—a phenomenon where taxes do not decrease proportionally with declining profits. This study examines the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance on corporate tax stickiness using data from Chinese A-share listed companies between 2009 and 2022. Our analysis reveals that enhanced ESG performance significantly reduces tax stickiness. Robustness checks and treatments for endogeneity confirm these findings. Additionally, the mitigating effect of ESG is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises, firms with strong internal controls, and technologically advanced companies. We identify three mechanisms through which ESG alleviates tax stickiness: enhancing bargaining power, reducing agency problems, and alleviating financing constraints. Importantly, improvements in ESG that reduce tax stickiness are associated with increased firm profitability. These findings offer valuable insights into mitigating the perceived tax burden for corporations and guiding national tax administration, while highlighting the broader benefits of ESG engagement."}}

We verify that setting targets to constrain the amount of derivative innovation in the portfolio may increase the rate of novel innovation and reduce the likelihood that projects are terminated.

While greater transparency can reduce information asymmetry and lower financing costs, negative disclosures may increase perceived risk and, consequently, firms' COE. We examine this trade-off using the adoption of U.S. state anti-SLAPP laws, which provide speech protections to corporate critics, thereby promoting the freer flow of information and negative disclosures. Employing an imputation-based difference-indifferences approach, we find that anti-SLAPP laws reduce firms' COE, especially for those in opaque information environments or with better-informed employees. Further analysis suggests that this effect operates through declines in information asymmetry, return volatility, and systematic and stock price crash risk. Our findings highlight how legal institutions that encourage free speech can lower financing costs by enhancing transparency and reducing uncertainty in capital markets."}}

However, in real-world contexts, variables are rarely operated in isolation. Their interdependence introduces a range of complexities that challenge the validity, robustness, and practical applicability of conventional decision-making tools. The objective of this research is to address the problem of interdependence among WSJF variables. To achieve this, Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) will be applied to solve and evaluate the impact and influence of this interdependence during the decision-making process. A relevant finding is that the effectiveness of the decision-making process improves when the interdependence between variables is determined."}}

To streamline the time-intensive building performance simulation process, heuristic algorithms and machine learning techniques are increasingly being adopted. While several methodologies have been proposed to optimize building envelope (BE) design, a lack of research remains in evaluating the effectiveness of different tools, algorithms and approaches across various design stages or circumstances. This study systematically reviews the different methods and workflows followed by 165 publications. The reviewed papers are disaggregated into design tasks and classified by the stages of the optimization process, the scale of work, the type of variables concerned, the simulation engines used, or the performance analysis accelerators employed, among others. The aim of the research is to understand the logic behind the optimization parameters, objectives or algorithms to frame them in a design methodology. Alternative decision-making processes, types of graphs, or process outputs are also reviewed, considering interaction and real impact on the decision maker or designer. The analysis leads to a specialized matrix that integrates design parameters, data generation and decision making processes, leveraging various AI tools to enhance optimization tasks. The combination of elements within the matrix defines the sequential steps of an optimization problem. This framework establishes a foundation for flexible, user-centered digital workflows that drive improvements in building efficiency and occupant comfort."}}

The portfolio optimisation problem is an asset allocation problem with a trade-off between return and financial risk that becomes NP-hard when cardinality constraints are introduced, i.e., limiting the number of assets or securities in the portfolio. A selection hyper-heuristic is a learning mechanism that functions as a high-level search strategy for selecting predefined low-level heuristics to apply iteratively during the optimisation process. Our methodology combines a low-level heuristic selection strategy, driven by a variant of a choice function algorithm, with the solution selection process employed in NSGA-II. This approach enhances our ability to efficiently choose and apply heuristics for optimisation. In this study, we explain the functionality and behaviour of the hyper-heuristic. Selecting from five mutation heuristics, the algorithm dynamically adapts to the search space to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. We conducted experiments on five financial portfolio benchmark datasets, including the UK FTSE100, using cardinalities K = 2 and K = 5 on a range of numbers of function evaluations. Based on the empirical results, the algorithm appears to perform well and provides insight into selecting a particular heuristic. This approach also indicates the potential for extensive exploration of the solution selection process."}}

The Note begins by exploring the rationale behind the idea, drawing on political science, economic, and legal literature to argue that subsidizing the franchise could help rebalance elected officials' perception of the \"median voter\" away from the wealthy. The Note hypothesizes that a small dollar incentive, perhaps no more than $20, paid in a municipal election would have a greater incentivizing effect on low-propensity, low-income voters than it would on higher-income voters. Next, the Note explores the legality and constitutionality of paying the voter. When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, vote buying became illegal across the United States. Nevertheless, this Note argues that, based on the legislative history of the Act, a government program to incentivize voting would be legal under federal law. Further, neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment poses a barrier to such a program, and a local government in California could enact such a program without violating state law. Finally, the Note explores policy design, proposing that policymakers should begin in a local government, provide direct and highly visible subsidies, and allow voters who cast blank ballots to collect a subsidy."}}

Royalty determination and distribution proceedings conducted by rate-setting bodies in a range of industries share similarities with the types of determinations that would be required of a FRAND rate-setting tribunal for SEPs. Namely, multiple parties with divergent interests are involved; the parties are initially permitted to work out an arrangement amongst themselves, but if they cannot, the tribunal’s procedures are activated; and the tribunal is empowered to compel discovery, conduct hearings, and otherwise adduce all relevant evidence. Accordingly, this Report first summarizes, in Part II, the historical and theoretical basis for governmental rate-setting. It then describes in some detail rate-setting procedures in other fields that can offer instructive models for a potential FRAND rate-setting body. These include rate-setting for US interstate transport, one of the first regulated industries and, at certain points in its history, one of the largest; public utilities such as gas, water and electricity; copyrighted works in the UK and US that are subject to compulsory licensing schemes; pharmaceutical products in the UK and US that are subject to price control and regulation, and the statutory interpleader cause of action in the US that enables multiple parties having claims on a single asset pool to petition a court to assess their claims in a single action to divide those assets equitably.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Report then turns in Part III to current methods of rate-setting for SEPs, including the private setting of aggregate royalty rates by patent pools, and judicial FRAND rate setting in and non-judicial alternative dispute resolution (arbitration and mediation). Part IV then summarizes recent proposals that have been made to establish FRAND rates for SEPs by other means. This includes the European Commission’s proposed EUIPO SEP Competence Centre, which is intended to maintain a database of European SEPs, to check the essentiality of SEPs to the standards under which they are declared on a sampled basis, and to determine, on a non-binding basis, aggregate FRAND royalty rates for all SEPs covering a particular standard, and rates for particular SEPs and SEP portfolios. This section then describes the proposed US Standard Essential Royalty Act (SERA), which would limit the ability of non-US courts from establishing FRAND royalty rates for US SEPs by creating a new US judicial body having the exclusive authority to determine FRAND rates for US SEPs. Next, it addresses a series of SDO and academic proposals concerning group negotiation of aggregate SEP royalty rates and caps, and an academic proposal for an international, non-governmental tribunal for setting aggregate SEP FRAND rates and allocations. This section then summarizes related proposals that may affect FRAND rate-setting, such as ex ante rate disclosure prior to the publication of a final standard, systems for “checking” the essentiality of declared SEPs and systems for checking the validity of declared SEPs. Finally, Part V applies the evidence presented in Parts II, III and IV to the specific features of a FRAND rate-setting system that are the subject of IPO’s inquiry, including its legal and institutional setting, decisional scope, and procedural design aspects.</span></p>"}}

The framework integrates a transformer-based LLM with symbolic policy enforcement, constraint-aware safety verification, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-optimized edge deployment. Unlike prior models that separate perception from control or rely solely on centralized inference, emergency LLM enables seamless interpretation of unstructured incident data, real-time policy validation, and decentralized execution via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) messaging. The model processes emergency reports into structured semantic representations, verifies outputs against expert-defined rules, and deploys validated decisions at the edge to ensure rapid, policy-compliant interventions. Extensive simulations on urban traffic scenarios demonstrate substantial performance gains: incident classification F1-scores exceed 95%, average emergency response times are reduced by up to 39.1%, and congestion levels drop by over 70% post-intervention. Moreover, the system achieves a 98.6% policy compliance rate while maintaining low latency and communication overhead.

However, these methods are limited by prime-numbered blades and restricted angular position exploration. This study addresses these limitations by improving the modulation method based on prime-numbered blade phase angles and introducing the cosecant function as an alternative to sine and cosine functions. Two types of squirrel-cage fans with different blade numbers, modulation functions, amounts, and periods are designed, and their unsteady noise spectra are analyzed. Results indicate that the improved method successfully applies to prime-numbered blades and various modulation functions, reducing constraints on phase angle offsets and enhancing design efficiency. The cosecant function expands the angular position exploration space. In an 11-blade fan, the preferred cosecant modulation scheme reduces sound pressure levels at the fundamental frequency by 2.89 dB and 5.19 dB compared to evenly spaced blades, by 2.16 dB and 3.87 dB compared to sine modulation, and by 1.89 dB and 4.09 dB compared to cosine modulation. Additionally, the second-order harmonic peak is reduced by 16.31% for 11-blade compared to the sine modulation and 23.36% for 13-blade compared to the cosine modulation. This study provides valuable insights for the broader application of uneven modulation technology in noise reduction and engineering."}}

While the transition to photovoltaic energy is essential to address climate change, conventional installations raise environmental concerns. To address these challenges, we developed a harmonised and flexible framework. First, using Miradi Adaptive Management Software, we built a situation model mapping the environmental threats of photovoltaic farm construction and operation, based on Conservation Standards classifications. Second, a scoping review identified best practices for mitigating these threats; these practices were then integrated into the situation model and translated into result chains. The result chain represents our Theory of Change, providing a structured pathway for photovoltaic farm best practices to address intermediate outcomes, conservation targets, ecosystem services, and societal challenges. A set of indicators was selected by cross-analysing the European Nature-based Solutions impact evaluation handbook and the result chain. The proposed harmonised framework supports tailored strategies and adaptive management and is thus flexible across diverse bioregions and stakeholders. Crucially, it contributes to transformative change by repositioning photovoltaic farms from single-purpose infrastructures to Nature-based Solutions that promote sustainable land use, biodiversity, and human well-being, fostering system-wide shifts in planning, governance, and collaboration."}}

Unlike conventional static hash algorithms, HashCraft supports on-demand, personalized hash function generation, and incorporates its verifier using an avalanche test to ensure the robustness of generated hash functions. Our prototype shows that HashCraft can produce secure hash functions within 20–40 sec, achieving attack resistance comparable to SHA-2/3. Also, we demonstrate its applicability in HMAC, where per-session hash diversification mitigates replay attacks with minimal overhead."}}

Despite its widespread use, the specific influence of pH on the flocculation of slurry remains inadequately understood. This study delves into the impact of pH values on the flocculation effectiveness of guar gum-treated bauxite mine slurry through comprehensive flocculation tests. Concurrently, zeta potential measurements, Fourier transform infrared analysis, and scanning electron microscopy analyses were conducted to elucidate the underlying micro-mechanisms of flocculation. The findings indicate that the guar gum significantly enhances the sedimentation rate of mine slurry particles at pH values of 9 or below. Conversely, at the pH of 11, sedimentation rate is markedly reduced, resulting in the persistence of suspended slurry particles. The optimal sedimentation rate was recorded at a neutral pH of 7. Insights from zeta potential data and SEM imagery suggest that the flocculation process is predominantly governed by the formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups in guar gum molecules and the particle surfaces of the mine slurry. This study provides a crucial understanding of the pH-dependent behavior of guar gum in slurry flocculation, offering valuable insights for optimizing industrial separation processes."}}

The methods used included Gerlach assessment through field measurements, RUSLE mapping, and interview data on household experiences with erosion in the study communities. The Gerlach assessment showed that erosion rates were approximately four times higher on high grounds (95 t ha-1 yr-1), compared to lowlands (25 t ha-1 yr-1). In terms of land use land cover (LULC) systems, erosion rates followed the pattern: bare lands (169.8) > grasslands (4.6) > forests/woodlands (0.003 t ha-1 yr-1). The RUSLE erosion mapping model showed that 69% of the GAMA had values that were higher than the international tolerant threshold of 5.0 t ha-1 yr-1. Soil quality trends, including properties such as organic matter, structure, and bulk density, were generally inversely correlated with vegetative cover and erosion rates. The study also showed that more than 95% of the households with untarred roads leading to them were affected by erosion. However, the drainage systems in Santa Maria mitigated the impact of erosion in the area."}}

Applying our method to popular monetary policy shocks, we learn that they do not represent textbook surprises Instead, they mix information about policy at many horizons, and this mix varies depending on how the EMPS is identified. We can use the estimated term structures to construct synthetic shocks with arbitrary term structures and assess their macroeconomic effects. Synthetic surprise interest rate hikes are contractionary with little effect on prices, while long-term forward guidance is deflationary."}}

In the non-linear model, we find that when labor markets are not tight, a contractionary monetary policy shock significantly increases inequality. However, when labor markets are tight, the sign is reversed.

First, company age consistently dampens market exposure: tripling a firm’s age lowers the five-year beta by roughly 0.10, a result confirmed by 2SLS. Second, this effect is asymmetric, reducing upside sensitivity (β+) about three times more than downside sensitivity (β−), implying that investor learning tempers reactions to favorable news while leaving vulnerability to broad market declines largely intact. Third, analyst coverage is state-dependent: it attenuates beta in calm periods but amplifies it during crises, when heightened uncertainty induces herding around widely disseminated signals. In sum, age-based familiarity offers a persistent hedge against systematic shocks, whereas signal-based familiarity interacts with macro conditions, producing horizon-contingent risk profiles."}}

Using National Accounts (NA) and Distributional Wealth Accounts (DWA) data from 2013 to 2022, we apply a synthetic differences-in-differences method to assess aggregate-level impacts. We explore the micro-foundation behind the results by applying the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) data. The reform led to a rise in deposits alongside a reduction in consumer debt balances. However, there was also a strong response in consumption. The household balance sheet effects declined over a year, while consumption stayed elevated, keeping quarterly inflation 1–2 percentage points higher than it would otherwise have been. Withdrawals were concentrated among contributors with little liquidity, a large outstanding balance of consumer debt and a high MPC, amplifying the reform’s impact on consumption."}}

At the provincial level, although China is still dominated by provinces with positive allometric growth, the number of provinces with negative allometric growth has gradually increased, and the provinces&apos; awareness of protecting electricity resources has been continuously improving. (2) In terms of spatial distribution, the new urbanization index and electricity consumption show an overall positive correlation, and the strength of the relationship first increases and then decreases, indicating that the electricity consumption structure has gradually begun to transform towards a green and low-carbon direction."}}

To analyze the effectiveness of Turkish monetary policy quantitatively, a structural model of the Turkish economy that allows for structural breaks is estimated under the alternative assumptions of rational expectations and adaptive learning. Using these estimates, counterfactual experiments are conducted to obtain ex-ante and ex-post inflation pressure measures that characterize, respectively, the pre-policy and post-policy inflationary environment. The inflation pressure indices indicate that there was no significant difference between the inflationary environments in the 2002-2005 period compared to the 1996-2001 period.

Calibrated to capture emerging market features, the model successfully generates greater aggregate consumption volatility compared to aggregate income even when the only source of fluctuations is a transitory productivity shock.

Treated municipalities cut capital expenditures, rather than decreasing current expenditures or raising taxes. The estimated local fiscal multiplier is not statistically different from zero and significantly lower than 1.5, even after accounting for spatial and public procurement network spillovers.

Using a dataset of observed charging sessions at public charging stations in Germany, the model identifies accurate utility functions, uncovers charging preferences, and simulates station segment viability.The results suggest that charging utility is non-linear: marginal utility decreases with charged energy and marginal disutility increases with charging duration. An interaction between energy and duration leads to higher marginal valuation of energy for longer charging durations.  Stations profit from inelastic demand driven by users who highly value energy content, are less price sensitive, and engage in high-value activities at the charging location, such as in urban areas or traffic hubs."}}

Study conclusion and policy recommendations: The study concluded and established, provided evidence that organizational success depends upon the interdependence recognized within teams and how vital it is for team members to understand their roles and work to achieve corporate goals thus having a positive influence on organizational performance. Finally the study recommends: that the management of financial institutions should promote shared values in the organization through allowing employees to have their expressions and view listened to, this allows the organization to develop a good culture which can be transformed into organizational values and norms. Leaders should trust their subordinated and assign them responsibilities and the subordinates should also trust their superiors.

This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the Act’s origins, implementation, and enduring legacy. It begins by contextualizing the Act within India’s caste system, tracing how ancient religious codifications – from the Rigveda to the Manusmriti – established and justified a rigid hierarchy that colonial policies later exploited. We analyze the language and intent of the Act, illustrating how the British administration wielded it as an instrument to control nomadic and marginalized groups by presuming criminality by birth. The short-term impacts on Dalits (formerly “Untouchables”), Adivasis (indigenous tribes), and other minorities were severe: communities faced loss of land, curtailed freedoms, and state-sanctioned stigma, with an estimated thirteen million people across 127 communities directly affected by Independence. The Act’s long-term repercussions persisted well beyond its repeal in 1949, as independent India’s Habitual Offenders Act (1952) continued to profile and police these denotified tribes, entrenching cycles of poverty and prejudice.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Crucially, this paper situates the Criminal Tribes Act in a comparative global context. Parallels are drawn to other systems of institutionalized oppression: the Jim Crow laws in the United States, which enforced a codified racial apartheid and denied African Americans basic rights; the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, whereby ~120,000 people (two-thirds U.S. citizens) were incarcerated without cause; and South Africa’s apartheid regime, which legally classified citizens by race to maintain white supremacy. These comparisons reveal common patterns of using the law to strip targeted groups of rights under the guise of “social order” or “national security.” The paper also examines modern surveillance measures – from preventive detention of Muslims under anti-terror laws to predictive policing technologies – arguing that the underlying logic of collective suspicion echoes the legacy of the 1871 Act in contemporary forms.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Through extensive use of scholarly sources, including archival colonial reports and the writings of historians and anthropologists, as well as eyewitness accounts and recent news reports, we highlight how the narrative of “born criminals” created by the Act remains etched in societal attitudes. We incorporate historical data (caste-based census records, crime statistics) and present-day metrics (crime rates against Dalits, wealth and education disparities by caste) to visualize the enduring impact. Graphs and charts are used to illustrate trends such as the economic marginalization of Dalits and the racial disparities in incarceration that mirror caste inequalities. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that while the Criminal Tribes Act was repealed, its spirit survives in prejudices and legal practices worldwide. It calls for a critical re-examination of laws and social structures that continue to otherize and criminalize marginalized communities, advocating for reforms grounded in equality, restorative justice, and the protection of fundamental rights. The global legacy of the Criminal Tribes Act serves as a cautionary tale of how state power can perpetuate social stratification – and a reminder of the ongoing struggle to dismantle such oppressive systems.\n</div>"}}

In line with the European Green Deal’s farm-to-fork strategy, maximizing fodder production from existing grasslands is more sustainable than relying on high-intensive cropland feed. Reducing imports and dependency on cropland feed is a global environmental goal. However, it remains unclear whether current grassland resources can sufficiently meet livestock’s energy needs.Objective This study assesses the balance of metabolizable energy (ME) from grasslands in two contrasting regions of Bavaria, Germany.Methods We estimate the ME balance per farm and year using data from the Integrated Administration Control System (IACS), including field usage, livestock information, and modeled yield data. We analyze variations between a dry year (2018) and a typical year (2020) under conventional and organic farming.Results and Discussions Results show an average ME deficit of ~1,000 GJ per farm (equivalent to 17 dairy cows) in northern Bavaria, whereas the (pre-)Alpine region in southern Bavaria generally shows surpluses, roughly one potential additional dairy cow per farm (~60 GJ surplus). Within the southern region, a north-south trend appears, with deficits in the north and surpluses in the south. No clear pattern emerges in northern Bavaria. Organic farms tend to exhibit higher ME surpluses than conventional farms. A geographically weighted regression reveals that elevation, precipitation, agri-environmental schemes, and farming practices significantly influence ME balances, with effects varying spatially.Significance These findings underscore the need of region-specific strategies to optimize grassland fodder production and enhance the resilience of livestock farming in a changing climate."}}

Employing the LangChain framework, we simulate eight GPT-based agents interacting over 20 rounds under four conditions-baseline (no communication, no sanctions), communication only, sanctions only, and communication with sanction sacross high and low endowment scenarios. Results show that LLM agents achieve near-optimal efficiency (100% by Round 20) when communication and sanctions are combined, mirroring human outcomes in Ostrom et al.'s work. LLM agents also consistently vote to implement sanctions, reinforcing self-governance principles. However, significant deviations emerge: in baseline conditions, LLM agents rapidly adjust to high efficiency (60-89% in high endowment, and 95-100% in low endowment), outperforming humans who struggle with persistent over-allocation (32% and ∼35%, respectively). In communication-only scenarios, LLM agents falter, settling on suboptimal strategies (e.g.,-33.2% efficiency in high endowment) due to an overly prosocial bias, unlike humans who achieve temporary gains (74.1%). Sanctions alone yield variable but improved outcomes (95.2% in high endowment), though agents overuse maximal penalties, lacking the graduated enforcement seen in human subjects. This replication underscores LLM agents' potential as a powerful tool for experimental economics, enabling rapid, scalable simulations, while revealing distinct AI behavioral dynamics-such as rapid learning and excessive agreeableness-that inform AI alignment and autonomous system design."}}

CONTEXTMany farmers face structural constraints and high fixed costs that limit their ability to adopt more extensive milk production strategies or even take land out of production.2. OBJECTIVEThis paper examines the economic trade-offs involved in adopting nature-inclusive farming practices in the Dutch dairy sector by quantifying the opportunity costs associated with implementing measures such as additional grazing days or reductions in external input use, and by examining the circumstances under which these costs arise or vary.3. METHODSUsing data from the Dutch Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and a bio-economic benchmarking model, we quantify these costs.4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONSOur findings suggest potential for increased farm income and improved environmental performance through the adoption of nature-inclusive practices, conditional on the implementation of more efficient management strategies. However, achieving such win-win outcomes generally requires greater reliance on capital and finance. When capital cost constraints were relaxed in the model, it favoured less capital-intensive pathways, including more extensive operations with reduced dependence on external variable inputs. Opportunity costs vary substantially across farms, with the highest costs found among those already farming extensively. The findings underscore a critical challenge for policymakers: facilitating the transition to nature-inclusive farming will likely require public compensation mechanisms or new market arrangements to offset foregone income.5. SIGNIFICANCEBy situating the Dutch dairy farming case within broader European sustainability and policy debates, the paper offers insights that are relevant for international efforts to integrate ecosystem service provision into agricultural systems. As farms reduce reliance on variable external input use and intensive production and diversify income streams, societal support will be essential in reshaping market incentives, policy frameworks, and value chain governance."}}

The intense competition in domestic and international markets fuels the process of industrialization, which raises the question of the extent to which market competition affects climate change. This chapter aims to answer this question by developing a model that explains the relationship between market competition and climate change based on a Cobb-Douglas production function. An empirical study is conducted using a dataset from 2007 to 2019 for a panel of the top 10 manufacturing countries. The feasible generalized least squares method is employed to estimate the proposed model and tackle the problems of cross-sectional dependence, heteroskedasticity, and serial correlation. The climate change performance index is used to assess the performance of countries in terms of climate protection, while market competition is measured by three proxies, namely the import penetration ratio, the extent of market dominance indicator, and the index of economic freedom. The empirical findings provide sufficient evidence of the negative effects of domestic market competition on climate protection in the top 10 manufacturing countries against the positive effects of foreign competition. They also reveal that financial development has a positive effect on climate change mitigation, unlike economic growth and foreign direct investment, which have negative effects. These findings are informative for policymakers to set out competition policies that can help address climate change."}}

Defining an optimal currency denomination structure by policy makers is essential not only for macroeconomic implications but also for reasons such as ease of transactions by citizens, eradicating counterfeiting and influencing people's perceptions about their wealth and purchasing power. Despite the surge in digital payments, cash remains the dominant mode of transactions in India. The RBI press release dated August 2017 2 mentions that optimal currency structure is the one that will minimize the number of denominations and simultaneously increase the probability of obtaining exact change in transactions of any given amount. Like many other countries India has adopted a near variation of the Renard series and has denominations in the series of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2000. There is a significant paucity of research on analyzing the currency denomination structure of India or determining its optimal structure, although a few related studies exist on analyzing factors affecting the structure and demand for currency. There is no research study yet to establish that the prevailing denomination mix satisfies the optimality criteria as described above. This study firstly provides an extensive literature review of the existing associated theories and their applications worldwide. Secondly, the study provides an empirical analysis of the prevailing currency denomination structure in India using the D-Metric Model developed by Dr. L.C. Payne in the late 1980s for determining the coin-tobanknote transition by relating it to the average daily wage level (D) of a country to its currency denomination structure. Most importantly, the study establishes that the prevailing denomination mix of 1:2:2:5 satisfies the first criteria of optimality, i.e. minimizing the token size. Finally, the study shows that a new mix 1:1:3:5 also satisfies the same criteria as defined above."}}

Hence, certain low-lying areas are still exposed and deal with flooding. These flooding situations turned into a significant turning point in the Philippine government's commitment to flood control. The pumping station is one such initiative, aimed at mitigating flooding and managing water waste. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the functionality in reducing the frequency, intensity, and contribution to enhancing urban flood resilience. Moreover, this paper employs a mixed-method approach to gain in-depth understanding, knowledge and strengthen the reliability and validity of the information and data gathered. This approach provides comprehensive data that Local Government Units (LGUs) can use to develop the project further. Based on the study, the researchers found out that the pumping stations are very effective flood control project since they will quickly alleviate flooding in a short period of time and continuously operate even when it is not raining. Additionally, the pumping station has the potential to enhance residence safety, beginning with the local government and continuing up to the national level, as long as it continues to manage solid waste since waste can cause malfunction in the pumping station. Concerning this, it is important to establish a policy and program recommendation designed to strengthen the operations of pumping station projects in Valenzuela City."}}

Built upon ConvNeXt as a backbone, our method captures fine-grained structures and global semantics by strategically injecting context into early layers and refining features at deeper stages. Aggregated intermediate predictions further guide the final mask generation through a unified decoder. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets: RCFD, Crack500, CFD, and Sylvie (zero-shot). Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baselines by up to 3.5% IoU and 2.8% F1-score on supervised datasets, and shows strong generalization with 42.91% F1-score and 63.03% mIoU in zero-shot testing. These results confirm CrackRefineNet’s effectiveness, robustness, and practical readiness for real-world pavement inspection."}}

This study explores the feasibility of implementing a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) mechanism to support the long-term sustainability of the ICRG in Nusa Dua, Bali. Using a mixed-methods approach—combining ecological assessment, economic valuation, and stakeholder analysis—the research calculates a PES value of IDR 35,154 (USD 2.13) per visitor. This value is derived from capital costs, estimated asset lifespan, annual maintenance requirements, and the economic value of ecosystem services utilized by visitors. The study situates its findings within global PES experiences from Costa Rica, Mexico, China, Kenya, and Vietnam, highlighting the importance of legal frameworks, community engagement, and technological integration in successful PES implementation. It emphasizes the need for phased financing strategies—beginning with government or donor support and transitioning to user-based payments through mechanisms such as tourism fees, eco-certification, and digital micro-payments. The findings advocate for a participatory, transparent, and adaptive PES model embedded within Indonesia’s marine spatial planning agenda. Ultimately, this study provides a replicable framework for sustainable reef restoration financing, supporting Indonesia’s commitments to marine conservation, climate resilience, and blue economy development."}}

By contrast, generative models use the underlying data distribution, resulting in more effective anomaly detection. Recent methods have integrated generative components into discriminative models rather than adopting purely generative segmentation models. Therefore, we propose an anomaly detection method on a purely generative semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we employ a vector-quantized variational autoencoder to detect anomalies, which encodes images into a categorical latent space of codevectors. By treating the segmentation class-specific codevectors as in-distribution (ID) representations, we introduce a codevector-wise top‑$K$ criterion. This criterion scores each pixel based on its top‑$K$ nearest codevectors and their associated scores, thereby reflecting relative similarities within the same classes. Furthermore, we implement a codevector-based multi-contrastive learning strategy with specially sampled void labels. This implementation effectively structures the latent space among classes and ensures that anomalies are not aligned with ID codevectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method detects anomalies effectively and performs robustly in single- and cross-domain scenarios."}}

However, recent multimodal pre-trained methods often rely on statistical comparisons between query and reference features, which may lead to overlapping anomaly scores due to neglecting normal region interference and local contextual correlations. To address this, we propose the Feature Discrepancy guided Score Learning (FDSL) method. FDSL explicitly models deviations from normal patterns via a Feature Discrepancy (FD) module that separates patch features into normal and deviation components. An Anomaly Score Learning (ASL) module is then introduced to capture feature correlations and integrate neighboring patch information for more discriminative scores. Additionally, a Local-enhanced Feature Extraction (LFE) mechanism improves detection of small-area anomalies, while an image feature index memory bank reduces redundancy to optimize memory usage. Experimental results on MVTec and VisA datasets show that FDSL achieves state-of-the-art performance in 1-shot, 2-shot, and 4-shot segmentation tasks and is competitive in classification, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in few-sample scenarios.

However, these methods are primarily dedicated to optimizing the rate-distortion (R-D) performance at medium and high bitrates ($>$ 0.1 bits per pixel (bpp)), while research on extremely low bitrates is limited. Besides, existing methods fail to explicitly explore the image structure and texture components crucial for image compression, treating them equally alongside uninformative components in networks. This can cause severe perceptual quality degradation, especially under low-bitrate scenarios. In this work, inspired by the success of pre-trained masked autoencoders (MAE) in many downstream tasks, we propose to rethink its mask sampling strategy from structure and texture perspectives for high redundancy reduction and discriminative feature representation, further unleashing the potential of LIC methods. Therefore, we present a dual-adaptive masking approach (DA-Mask) that samples visible patches based on the structure and texture distributions of original images. We combine DA-Mask and pre-trained MAE in masked image modeling (MIM) as an initial compressor that abstracts informative semantic context and texture representations. Such a pipeline can cooperate well with LIC networks to achieve further secondary compression while preserving promising reconstruction quality. Consequently, we propose a simple yet effective masked compression model (MCM), the first framework that unifies MIM and LIC end-to-end for extremely low-bitrate image compression. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in R-D performance and visual quality at very low bitrates.

Using a difference-in-difference approach, we examine county-level business registrations (2010-2022) and household survey data (2010-2020). The program significantly increased unincorporated business entry by 6.9% at the county level and raised household business ownership by 2.75 percentage points. Three mechanism drive these gains: spillover from large enterprises, expanded access to credit, and infrastructure improvements. Effects concentrate in counties with stable leadership and moderate corruption and are strongest in agriculture and among poor households, showing that well-governed, targeted interventions can redirect business ownership toward disadvantaged groups.

Kar Medical College triggered both public demonstrations for justice and discovered enduring institutional problems and daily unfairness inside medical facilities throughout West Bengal. Abhaya's' demise exposed an institutional environment which combines culture of threat and intimidation with systemic corruption in the medical colleges of the state. During the R.G. Kar uprising junior doctors demanded a transformation of institutional policies as well as workplace safety measures alongside a system of institutional oversight. Based on this evidence the article shows that recurring contentious actions against entrenched power structure show no capability to dismantle deep-rooted everyday injustice. The successful path to substantial change requires combining deliberative and dialogical practices which include dismissing daily injustices. Medical institutions that shift from protest responses toward cultural-functional changes can move toward accountable practices that provide equity. The pursuit of justice involves more than receiving compensation following disasters and punishing the guilty because it requires eradication of daily unjust practices before they turn into a tragedy like Abhaya."}}

Grounded in resource orchestration theory and based on panel data of A-share listed firms in China from 2011 to 2021, along with regional DIF index data, we conduct an empirical analysis. The results show that DIF significantly enhances corporate carbon disclosure. DIF simultaneously exerts a negative effect on firms&apos; technology innovation, revealing a masking mediating effect where DIF promotes disclosure but partially offsets this benefit by suppressing internal technological advancement. In addition, firm size plays a positive moderating role in the relationship between DIF and innovation; larger firms are better able to integrate DIF-related resources and mitigate its inhibitory effect on innovation activities. Regional heterogeneity analysis further indicates that DIF significantly promotes carbon disclosure in eastern China. This study enriches the literature on digital finance and environmental information disclosure and provides theoretical insights and practical implications for improving corporate transparency and designing targeted policy interventions."}}

We further contrast the DEA model with the ongoing WTO negotiations towards an agreement on electronic commerce and examine the legal compatibility of DEAs with WTO law.

Mycorrhizal symbiosis can improve plant resistance against diverse pests and pathogens in different plant species. Yet, the wider adoption of Mycorrhiza-Induced Resistance (MIR) in pest management is hindered by its high context-dependency. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of MIR in tomato against T. urticae performing multiple experiments, ranging from laboratory to real production conditions. We hypothesised that MIR would be functional to protect tomato plants against the mite from the lab to the field. MIR was observed under lab and semi-field conditions in artificial infestation bioassays. A dedicated metabolomic analysis revealed that MIR primed two phenylpropanoids, malic acid and a flavonoid. MIR and chemical treatments were escalated to real tomato production conditions. Plants inoculated with the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis behaved resistant against T. urticae, strongly reducing the natural infestation of the spider mite. Similarly, the identified primed compounds caused a marked reduction in the incidence of the pest. Collectively, we show for the first time that MIR against T. urticae provides a consistent and strong protection in tomato in different culture scenarios, highlighting its context-stability in this pathosystem. MIR primes a specific fingerprint of secondary metabolites which enhance protection of tomato plants under real field conditions. We provide solid evidence supporting that MIR and MIR-related priming compounds could be valuable additions into IPM programs to improve tomato pest control."}}

In this article, I locate the doctrine's theoretical foundations in liquidation protection-the rules that shield corporate assets from unilateral withdrawals, thereby facilitating capital lock-in and long-term investment. Although these rules offer clear benefits, they also carry costs, including the risk of controller opportunism. Drawing on a Law &amp; Economics framework, I argue that, while the question of how best to tailor the rule to manage these trade-offs depends on empirical considerations, the notion that shareholders have voluntarily subordinated their claims to those of the company provides a robust response to these considerations, and in turn offers a strong justification for the existence of the doctrine. Nevertheless, I propose that factors such as the derivative action regime and conflict-of-interest constraints can help refine the rule's application. I also examine whether creditors should face a similar bar on overlapping losses, focusing on whether they voluntarily subordinate their claims in a manner analogous to shareholders. By engaging with recent legal developments, including Sevilleja v Marex Financial Ltd [2020] UKSC 31, I aim to provide a nuanced perspective on how liquidation protection shapes incentives under evolving reflective loss rules."}}

Under a gradual reform, voters first decide on implementing an intermediate policy level, followed by a second decision between maintaining the intermediate level or adopting a higher level. We hypothesize that the gradual reform may increase voter support by shifting norms and correcting misperceptions about the effects of the policy; but it has the disadvantage that the benefits of a high policy level, relative to an intermediate level, can appear (too) small: voters are satisfied with the intermediate policy. Our empirical findings reveal that the gradual reform backfires: fewer voters support the high policy level under the gradual reform than under the one-step reform. This effect appears to stem from voter satisfaction with the intermediate policy level and from adverse responses to subsequent reform steps. Further, while experience indeed reduces misperceptions about the intermediate policy level, there is no spillover of this experience to perceptions of the high level. Information provision about descriptive norms partially alleviates backfiring of the gradual reform."}}

Using a bank-level quarterly panel dataset and an estimated policy rule for the 7-day repo rate, we find that access to wholesale funding amplifies the transmission of monetary policy easing to lending by non-state banks, but also heightens their vulnerability to systemic risk during economic downturns. Since 2018, non-state banks with greater reliance on wholesale funding have experienced larger increases in expected capital shortfalls. To interpret these findings, we develop a structural model that incorporates a dual-track interest rate system and a segmented deposit market. The model quantifies the role of a liquidity reallocation channel from state to non-state banks and reveals a macroprudential trade-off: tighter regulation of wholesale funding weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy but mitigates systemic risk.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34056\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

We use administrative data for the universe of employer-employee matches from 2005-2019 to analyze worker mobility in a general but tractable framework, which allows for firm effects that depend on workers’ job history. Using differences in average pay between origin and destination firms as the treatment intensity of a job move, we analyze transitions up and down the job ladder and estimate race-specific passthrough rates of average firm pay into a mover’s own earnings. First, we find race-specific asymmetry around the direction of the move, whereby losses experienced in downward transitions are meaningfully larger than gains from upward transitions with a similar treatment intensity. For a $1 earnings increase in transitions up the job ladder, earnings passthroughs in transitions down the job ladder impose an earnings loss of $1.25 among White workers and $1.50 among Black workers. Second, we uncover career setbacks as a novel pathway in the evolution of racial earnings gaps. In transitions down the job ladder, Black workers lose an additional $0.24 for every $1 decrease in White workers’ earnings, a finding which prevails across sex and age. This “racial penalty” is not driven by differential pay, as it is completely absent when Black and White workers move between the same firm pairs. Instead, the penalty is due to differential sorting following career setbacks, so that Black workers regain employment in “worse” jobs, with strong evidence for racial differences in access to short-run liquidity as a mechanism. Overall, our findings offer a robust and computationally simple framework for modeling earnings determination processes and have implications for safety-net policies in the American labor market.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34058\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Unlike top managers, frontline leaders are essential for implementing organizational strategies by maintaining team cohesion when shirking is profitable for workers. We study this in the context of the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, using data on 2.2 million soldiers and tracking captains and their 100-soldier companies at weekly frequency throughout the conflict. We estimate leader fixed effects during non-combat weeks to measure leadership quality in a leader value-added framework. We validate this measure by showing that captains were not assigned based on prior unit performance or observable pre-war characteristics. High-quality leaders earned more after the war, but not before, and were more frequently recognized as good leaders in their postwar biographies. Daily event-study estimates around major battles show that better captains significantly reduced desertions in combat. Exploiting quasi-random leader turnover, we find evidence that this effect is causal. Using digitized battle maps, we rule out risk aversion as a mechanism and find instead that better leaders had higher mortality rates, consistent with a leading-by-example explanation. We also document modest learning-by-doing effects. These findings highlight the often-overlooked importance of frontline leadership, where direct supervision and interpersonal influence are strongest.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34057\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

One exercise demonstrates the consistency between retrospective and contemporaneous survey data when the two overlap. Another procedure shows that the retrospective values are similar when generated from individual ISSP surveys for 1991, 1998, 2008, and 2018; that is, there is no clear dependence of memory on the number of years of recall. The new data document a century-long “Great Religious Divergence” between North and South. We use the data to carry out event studies for effects on religious-service attendance of two major events.  Vatican II, in 1962-1965, triggered a decline in worldwide Catholic attendance relative to that in other denominations. In contrast, the endings of Communism in the early 1990s did not systematically affect religious-service attendance.

The authors concluded that imports from China reduced manufacturing employment and lowered wages of workers in non-manufacturing industries. In this article, I argue that the conceptual model used in ADH is misspecified because Chinese imports represent only a fraction of all imports and are correlated with imports from other countries. A correctly specified model would use total imports or imports from all major countries to measure trade exposure and its effects. The misspecification of the model used by ADH results in a violation of the exclusion restriction in their instrumental variables approach. The instrument for Chinese imports is correlated with imports from other countries. The violation of the exclusion restriction renders estimates in ADH, at best, uninformative and more worryingly misleading. I provide substantial evidence to support this conclusion."}}

We leverage quasi-experimental variation in inequity generated by the boundaries of geographic sectors used to compute tax liabilities and a large tax reform in a series of augmented boundary discontinuity designs. We find that inequities significantly reduce tax compliance. The elasticity of compliance with respect to inequity is between 0.12 and 0.25, accounting for half of the overall change in compliance at the boundaries. A simple model of presumptive property taxation shows how mistagging affects the optimal tax schedule, highlighting the opposite implications of responses to the level of taxation and to inequity for optimal tax progressivity. Interpreting our findings through the lens of the model implies that optimal progressivity is around 50% lower than it would be absent inequity responses. These results underscore the importance of inequity for public policy design, especially in contexts with low fiscal capacity.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34062\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

While many policymakers and commentators assume that cutting sovereign debt is always prudent, we argue that any significant reduction under strict limits structurally creates crisis. Traditionally, people believe that debt control and economic crises merely correlate because both appear during downturns-in line with the familiar phrase \"correlation does not imply causation.\" But we show that in this case, there is indeed direct causation: when residual debt must be conserved within a closed system, forcing it out of the public balance sheet simply shifts it onto weaker actors, until defaults cascade. The omitted formal demonstration can be found in [1, 2]. This note illustrates the same mechanism with real-world examples, showing how forced deleveraging has repeatedly amplified systemic risk rather than removing it."}}

Among these, family functioning has emerged as a central determinant, encompassing the quality of interactions, emotional bonds, communication patterns, role fulfillment, and problem-solving capacities within the family unit. This systematic review explores empirical literature on how various dimensions of family functioning influence children's mental health outcomes. The review synthesizes studies from multiple disciplines including psychology, psychiatry, family studies, and social work, focusing on key domains such as family cohesion, adaptability, conflict, parenting practices, and emotional expressiveness. Results indicate that higher levels of family cohesion and adaptability are strongly associated with better emotional regulation, lower levels of anxiety and depression, and fewer behavioral issues among children. Conversely, poor family functioning marked by persistent conflict, emotional disengagement, and inconsistent parenting correlates with increased internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, family functioning acts as both a mediator and moderator of external stressors such as socioeconomic adversity and trauma. The findings underscore the importance of family-based assessments and interventions in both preventive and clinical contexts. Future research should employ longitudinal designs, culturally sensitive measures, and integrative frameworks to deepen understanding and inform targeted support strategies. Enhancing family functioning represents a vital pathway to promoting resilience and psychological well-being in children."}}

This paper introduces a novel tensor decomposition-based model designed to complete missing data in cloud-based EV platforms. The proposed tensor model takes into account the unique characteristics of EV data as well as the specific objectives and constraints of the platform. To improve both accuracy and interpretability, the model incorporates a Bayesian probabilistic framework along with variational inference for optimization. Numerical experiments conducted on real-world EV operational data demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional vector and matrix-based methods in terms of data completion accuracy and generalization."}}

However, there are a variety of illegal activities in online transactions, such as food safety issues, etc. Illegal activities in online transactions have posed a threat to personal safety and market stability. By providing early warnings based on the risk value of illegal activities and implementing corresponding measures, economic losses resulting from illegal activities can be minimized. Furthermore, fine-grained warning signals can effectively prevent market instability caused by excessive measures. However, the diversity of illegal activities and the continuous fluctuation of their risk values, influenced by factors like market conditions, pose challenges to the accuracy of warnings. Given these challenges, traditional early warning techniques that rely on static thresholds often fail to provide effective warnings. To address these issues, this paper proposes a warning algorithm based on reinforcement learning from human feedback. The proposed algorithm adaptively adjusts the warning thresholds based on the type of illegal activities and fluctuating risk values to generate warning levels that align with human expectations. These risk values are calculated by assessing the likelihood that the accumulated occurrence of a particular type of illegal activity within a given period will exceed a threshold in the near future, signaling an abnormal accumulation. Experimental results on real-world data show that our method achieves a macro average accuracy of 92.5% and a macro average precision of 95.5%."}}

To address these challenges, we propose DQNEGHF, a novel dual-timescale hierarchical optimization framework that synergistically integrates Deep Q-Network (DQN) for fast-timescale beam scheduling with evolutionary game theory for slow-timescale strategy optimization. Our mathematical framework rigorously models the coupled interference-queue dynamics in hybrid satellite constellations while adhering to spectrum-sharing requirements. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DQNEGHF achieves 92.9\\% of the throughput performance of centralized global DQN while reducing processing delay by 85\\% and communication complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. The framework exhibits robust convergence properties with theoretical guarantees, as validated through comprehensive sensitivity analysis across key hyperparameters. Our approach provides a scalable and practical solution for next-generation satellite networks, effectively balancing performance optimality with computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments."}}

Despite Nigeria's significant natural gas reserves, deficiencies in infrastructure, regulatory inefficiencies, and sociopolitical instability continue to impede equitable energy access and economic development. Using a mixed-methods approach grounded in institutional theory and the energy trilemma framework, this study integrates quantitative data from national statistics and stakeholder surveys with qualitative insights from industry experts and local communities. This study finds a significant positive correlation between the accessibility of natural gas and prominent economic indicators such as employment, tax collection, and labour earnings. Nonetheless, this study also finds important inhibitions, such as pipeline damage, aged infrastructure, policy inconsistency, and limited access in rural areas. These factors all erode the accessibility, reliability, affordability, and sustainability of natural gas as a strategic energy source. Environmental issues, most notably methane emissions and the persistence of gas flaring, present additional hurdles for Nigeria's climate engagement with the Paris Agreement. The study concludes that a comprehensive approach consisting of infrastructure development, regulatory liberalisation, environmental compliance, and equity-based policy is needed for Nigeria to utilize its gas potential towards sustainable development. International best practices from the United Kingdom and the United States are comparatively utilised for the development of a hybrid framework calibrated according to Nigeria's socioeconomic and institutional environment. This study contributes to the energy policy domain by providing a multidimensional assessment of infrastructure governance and its energy transition implications for resource-based developing nations."}}

Based on a data sample of daily prices for SPX options, VIX futures and VIX options (from January 2007 to May 2022), both pricing kernels imply that the puzzling negative estimates of the volatility risk premiums would have to be associated to negative risk tolerance parameter values as well as to implausible equity risk premium levels. Alternatively, when both pricing kernels are fitted to the proxy proposed by Tetlock et al.

It provides a granular analysis of how India's equity, debt, and derivatives markets evolved into a more robust, transparent, and inclusive financial ecosystem. During this time, market capitalization surged from approximately $1.6 trillion in 2010 to over $5.5 trillion by mid-2025, positioning India among the world's top five markets. The corporate bond segment expanded from around 6% to 18% of GDP, though it still trails advanced economies, indicating considerable room for future growth. Mutual fund assets under management witnessed a tenfold rise, reaching ₹72 trillion, while the retail investor base grew exponentially-from fewer than 20 million demat accounts in 2010 to over 130 million by 2025-signifying profound market democratization. Critical reforms led by SEBI included overhauls of listing and disclosure norms (LODR), facilitation of new instruments such as REITs, InvITs, and SME listings, as well as stringent corporate governance and investor protection frameworks. RBI's monetary policies and debt market innovations, including the Retail Direct G-Sec scheme and liberalized ECB norms, complemented these efforts. The integration of commodity markets under SEBI post-2015 and the introduction of universal exchanges marked another milestone. Technological advancements such as algorithmic trading regulations, T+1 settlement, and distributed ledger tracking of bond covenants enhanced market efficiency and risk oversight. Beyond documenting achievements, the study highlights enduring challenges: a relatively shallow corporate bond market, concentration risks in equity turnover, and the nascent state of ESG integration. By blending empirical market data, regulatory analysis, and global benchmarks, this study offers valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and scholars on how strategic reforms, coupled with macroeconomic dynamics, propelled India's capital markets into a pivotal role in financing the nation's growth and fostering economic resilience."}}

This study quantifies the yield effects of varietal age in Kenya using a three-wave panel survey (2023-2024) of 4,160 smallholder households across Kenya. Using entropy balancing and weighted regression models to isolate the effect of varietal age on maize yield, we find a strong and consistent relationship between varietal age and yield. New varieties yield 147 kg/ha more than old ones in the long rains and 91 kg/ha more in the short rains. Finer age categorization reveals that switching to ultra-new varieties (0-5 years) delivers the highest gains-360 kg/ha over ultra-old varieties (21+ years) in the long rains and 269 kg/ha in the short rains. These findings suggest that slow varietal turnover carries significant opportunity costs in the form of forgone yield gains. While farmers generally perceive new varieties favorably-particularly for yield potential, early maturity and grain quality-concerns around labor intensity and resilience remain, potentially dampening adoption. Providing farmers with clear, locally relevant performance data and opportunities for on-farm experimentation can help shift perceptions and support wider uptake. Policies and programs that expand access to newer, better-performing varieties and strengthen seed quality assurance are essential for translating genetic gains into productivity improvements across Kenya's bimodal maize production systems."}}

Both established and emerging economies exhibit conditional convergence, with the latter exhibiting a greater rate of convergence, according to the data. Furthermore, absolute convergence is noted, suggesting that countries with varying degrees of development have unique convergence trends. One important conclusion is that average CO2 levels grow quickly in developing countries while they decline slowly in wealthier ones, indicating that convergence alone is inadequate to judge climate actions taken in particular countries positively. The study shows that, in contrast to developed countries, stronger environmental rules and growing globalization have a major impact on the CO2 convergence process in emerging countries. It&apos;s interesting to see that GDP has no discernible effect on this process, while industrialization and renewable energy have no effect.

The core idea is simple: a behavior is moral if, when everyone does it, almost everyone benefits; it is immoral if, when everyone does it, almost everyone is harmed. This view is consequentialist in spirit, like utilitarianism, but adds a self-stabilizing condition: the pattern must not depend on hidden net-loss contributors or groups that have a rational incentive to revolt and destroy total well-being. In this sense, fairness is seen as an instrument for stability, not as an absolute principle. The framework does not claim to cover all moral questions. It is intentionally self-constraining: when the condition gives no clear result, it stays silent instead of forcing a moral judgment. This paper highlights how this test differs from traditional moral theories and why respecting real-world group dynamics is essential to keep any claimed benefit stable when scaled up."}}

We find a significant ESG penalty: profiles randomly labeled with ESG attributes receive substantially lower collaboration interest from both founders and VCs. This penalty is primarily driven by negative performance beliefs—ESG-labeled profiles are perceived as less profitable and less accessible. To isolate taste-based preferences, we further implement a willingness-to-pay experiment in which participants may forgo part of a lottery reward to receive additional match recommendations of comparable quality. Participants randomly offered ESG-oriented recommendations are now significantly more likely to pay, revealing a latent preference for ESG once performance concerns are held constant.

In contrast to the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion that requires computing eigenpairs of the autocorrelation function, SAFD directly provides an explicit analytical representation of non-Gaussian processes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SAFD reduces approximation errors by 70-85% compared to KL at low-order expansions (e.g., 2 or 5 terms). These results show that SAFD achieves target covariance approximation with fewer expansion terms and significantly faster convergence."}}

Results are drawn from a Central Bank of Malta survey which analyses companies operating in the highest greenhouse gas intensive emitting sectors. Findings reveal that while 60% of firms do not calculate their carbon footprint, over 80% acknowledged the need for new technologies and investments in existing systems to achieve sustainability goals. As such, 67% of firms reported that they have already started to implement environmentally friendly measures however, only 28% maintain a recurring budget for green initiatives, underscoring gaps in sustainable practices. Key barriers include high upfront costs, regulatory difficulties, and insufficient financial support. The study highlights the need for governmental interventions, such as expanded financial incentives, streamlined application processes, and increased awareness campaigns, to accelerate firms' transition to sustainability. It also stresses the importance of increasing climate awareness to develop clear sustainability strategies, integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, and fostering a collaborative approach between firms and policymakers to achieve climate targets."}}

Can debt-for-nature instruments attract more capital for biodiversity finance? Debt-for-nature instruments first appeared in the market in the 1980s; however, they have seen a recent surge in popularity, with transactions predominantly focused on marine conservation. These transactions have gained attention for their size, innovative nature, and conservation focus. However, they have also faced criticism surrounding sovereignty, effectiveness, and transaction costs. The descriptive qualitative analysis of a comprehensive and global sample of the eight tripartite type debt-for-nature instruments brought to market since 2015, with a detailed case study of the Belize transaction, indicates that such deals may be costly to negotiate, the use of blue bond labeling can be misleading, conservation benefits are limited, and they have limited replicability. On the positive side, these deals have introduced innovative structures to unlock additional funds for conservation. The best examples are structured with a larger financial commitment to nature and strong enforcement mechanisms. In some cases, the transaction laid the groundwork for future marine conservation funding and commitments. Debt-for-nature instruments are not a silver bullet for either environmental impact or debt refinancing; however, the benefits of recent transactions indicate a role for such innovative instruments in conservation finance."}}

We study a democratic socialist setting where we have ample information on such attitudes: the Israeli kibbutzim. Exploiting an economic crisis that hit some kibbutzim more than others, we find that the crisis led to reduced support for leftist political parties. This effect persisted for over 20 years after the crisis had ended. We document that the electoral movement was rooted in a rightward shift in economic attitudes, suggesting that economic crises may undermine socialist regimes by silently changing attitudes toward them. In our unique setting, we can also study recovery mechanisms from the crisis. First, we find that while a sharp debt relief arrangement restored trust in the leadership, it did not reverse the impact of the crisis on economic attitudes. Second, as part of their efforts to recover from the crisis, kibbutzim liberalized their labor markets. Analyzing the staggered shift away from equal sharing to market-based wages, we find that this labor market liberalization led kibbutz members to move further rightward in their political voting and economic attitudes.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34049\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Research grows on a positive correlation between ESG and corporate performance, and 2023 constitutes a turning point marked by a backlash in the U.S. This has prompted a reassessment of sustainability strategies and raised concerns about potential conflicts with the fiduciary duties of directors and portfolio managers. This paper explores the tension between ESG and shareholder primacy under Delaware law, which is home to 66% of Fortune 500 companies. It is a contribution to the theories of shareholder primacy and corporate governance with the most up-to-date evidence, at the intersection of law, economics and finance. Although Delaware courts have not specifically approached the liability extent of directors and asset managers in ESG-related decisions, they have established the elements of the fiduciary duties of care and loyalty, which can be applied to ESGaligned decisions. This paper highlights guidelines for directors, portfolio managers and fiduciaries when making ESG-aligned decisions, in particular the careful documentation of the process followed in reaching a decision. The paper also calls for more rigour in the field of sustainability."}}

We compare and contrast the Covid-Related Financial Crisis (CFC) with previous shocks. Policy responses included the traditional toolkit of lower policy rates, more flexible rules on loan loss provisioning and capital rules, injection of liquidity through direct lending and asset repurchase, and expanding public balance sheets among others. Banks implemented their own response to the crisis, by tapping into funding lines to increase their liquidity cushions, offering loan forbearance, and serving as distribution agents for government subsidies. Capital markets played their role via record-high levels of debt issuance and convertibles. The CFC will accelerate trends that were visible in the financial industry. From branch closures to a rise in contactless payments and the growth of super apps, the health crisis is leading to new practices by financial institutions, being a catalyst for digital banking. Moreover, it is impacting the demand for financial products, with a rise in demand for insurance protection and increased interest in sustainable investment strategies.

We find that parents who were randomly selected to receive a $1,000 per month unconditional cash transfer for three years spent more on their children each month and reported better parenting behaviors (such as supervising their children more closely) compared to those randomized to receive $50 per month over the same period. However, possibly due to this closer monitoring, parents in the treatment group also reported that their child was experiencing more developmental difficulties and stress. Parents with the lowest incomes at baseline experienced the largest improvements in parenting; among these parents, the transfer also increased the use and quality of non-parental child care. The transfer did not have a meaningful effect on most educational outcomes measured in school administrative records, nor did it affect characteristics of the home environment, child food security, exposure to homelessness, or parental satisfaction. Although treated families were more likely to move, we did not detect changes in most measures of neighborhood quality, though proximity to child-focused amenities such as daycares appeared to increase in the treatment group relative to the control group. The transfer did not affect childbearing, pregnancy, or outcomes related to contraception. While the transfer reduced parents&apos; stress and mental distress in the first year of the program, these effects were short-lived and dissipated by the second year of the transfer, analogous to what was documented previously in the full population of participants."}}

We aim to describe and understand international power stemming from trade. Using an illustrative model of trade with possibilities of bilateral disputes and ex-post hold-ups, we highlight that bilateral asymmetry in import dependence can be a source of coercive power towards one another. We construct the model-implied measure of international power—asymmetric bilateral import dependence, weighted inversely by sectoral trade elasticities — across country pairs over the past 20 years. Combining this measure with comprehensive data on bilateral engagement events and a high-frequency measure of bilateral geopolitical relationships, we examine the consequences and strategic causes of international power. We show two main empirical results. First, increases in international power between countries — which raise the credibility of threats of trade disruptions — induce more bilateral engagement and negotiations. Second, worsened geopolitical relationships — in anticipation of future disputes — prompt countries to build up greater international power through adjusting trade activities.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34006\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Scaling coastal wetland restoration as a nature-based solution in Australia hinges on the cooperation of private landholders, who own much of the land with restoration potential. Yet existing incentive-design research has focused on public or corporate holdings, leaving a critical gap in understanding how private landholders weigh monetary versus non-monetary factors when deciding whether to restore wetlands on their properties. To address this gap, we surveyed coastal landholders nation-wide and ran a discrete-choice experiment to quantify the financial incentives and programme features most likely to incentivise wetland restoration and permanent protection. Choice data were analysed with random-parameter logit, latent-class, and hurdle models, while qualitative survey responses corroborated and contextualised model outputs. Our findings show private landholders are generally interested in coastal wetland restoration but reluctant to participate in permanent restoration programs. Many can be enticed provided the payment is sufficiently high in the context of current land values. Non-monetary elements also matter: programmes that minimise transaction costs through administrative assistance and cover ongoing wetland maintenance receive higher stated participation rates, as do publicly funded programs. By quantifying the relative importance of these factors for private landholders, this study offers actionable guidance for designing, funding, and administering blue-carbon incentive programmes in Australia and comparable contexts. It also provides methodological insights for conducting stated-preference research with small, heterogeneous target groups."}}

One such measure – implemented in the early 2000s and made more generous in recent years – allows smaller firms that establish an ESRP to claim a tax credit to offset part of their costs during the initial years. We examine firm take-up of this credit. We find that only 1 percent (pre-policy expansion) to 5.5 percent (post-policy expansion) of apparently eligible firms claim the credit. We document heterogeneity in credit take-up rates by industry, firm owner education, and use of tax preparation services. We also document evidence of “tax preparer learning,” whereby take-up among a tax preparer’s clients increases after that preparer files their first credit. Finally, we document that most firms only claim the credit for one year despite being eligible to do so for up to three years.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34043\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

The key mechanism operates through a ‘green is in the future’ channel: green patents are expected to generate higher profits in the future, making green patenting less sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations. In general equilibrium, this channel is reinforced, making green and non-green innovation effective substitutes.

In absence of cut-money culture, upward distortion in quota under only grand corruption is less (more) than that in case only petty corruption is possible, under certain conditions. Interestingly, in absence of cut-money culture, petty corruption never occurs. However, the threat of petty corruption induces the policymaker to set a higher quota, unless corrupt policymaker sufficiently discounts environmental damage. Grand corruption occurs only in the latter case. In contrast, corruption of at least one type always occurs under cut-money culture. While the presence of cut-money culture reduces quota from the `no-petty-corruption-enforcing&apos; level in some cases, but it results in higher total extraction, greater environmental damage and lower welfare. Our results have important implications for designing corruption control mechanisms and the governance of natural resource extraction."}}

We answer this by developing a model of global sourcing under partial contractibility, where firm-supplier relationships are exposed to a bilateral holdup problem. Sourcing decisions aggregate into a gravity equation for trade flows by organizational mode (intrafirm vs. arm’s length), which we take to structural estimation. We can then evaluate welfare changes with an extended Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) formula that incorporates these contracting frictions. Our counterfactual analysis reveals a sizeable average country welfare gain of 9.2% from eliminating contracting frictions in global sourcing. We further show how accounting for these frictions significantly reshapes quantitative assessments of the welfare gains from trade, including the stakes in a US-China decoupling scenario.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34044\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Does this reflect informed, forward-looking choices or unanticipated constraints? We study this question in Pakistan, where two-thirds of college-educated women remain out of the labor force. Tracking 2,400 students from two major universities, we document labor market expectations before graduation, and realized outcomes in the year that follows. Men and women have similar work aspirations, apply at similar times and rates, and receive comparable numbers of job offers, but women are more likely to reject them. As a result, a 27 pp employment gap emerges within six months. The gap stems largely from timing: for women, there is a critical window, immediately post-graduation, during which job search is associated with much higher chances of employment. There is no such window for men. To test whether this relationship is causal—and anticipated—we randomize a modest incentive to apply early.

In absence of cut-money culture, upward distortion in quota under only grand corruption is less (more) than that in case only petty corruption is possible, under certain conditions. Interestingly, in absence of cut-money culture, petty corruption never occurs. However, the threat of petty corruption induces the policymaker to set a higher quota, unless corrupt policymaker sufficiently discounts environmental damage. Grand corruption occurs only in the latter case. In contrast, corruption of at least one type always occurs under cut-money culture. While the presence of cut-money culture reduces quota from the `no-petty-corruption-enforcing&apos; level in some cases, but it results in higher total extraction, greater environmental damage and lower welfare. Our results have important implications for designing corruption control mechanisms and the governance of natural resource extraction."}}

Utilizing CAISO data from 2018 to 2020, the study assesses whether Bitcoin mining can effectively consume excess renewable energy during low-demand hours, mitigating curtailment and optimizing profitability. By analyzing Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) across different energy sources, the research identifies wind and solar as viable energy inputs for mining operations, particularly during hours with lower or negative prices. Additionally, this study examines how Bitcoin price fluctuations affect optimal mining periods, taking into account the economic feasibility of mining under varying electricity costs. The findings suggest that while Bitcoin mining can potentially absorb surplus renewable power, its environmental and economic viability depends on significantly lower Bitcoin prices than historical averages. This study contributes to the broader discourse on integrating cryptocurrency mining into sustainable energy systems, offering implications for energy policymakers, cryptocurrency stakeholders, and environmental advocates. Bitcoin miners could play a pivotal role in stabilizing power grids and advancing renewable energy adoption by strategically timing their operations to coincide with low-cost, renewable electricity sources."}}

While renewable energy is crucial for climate change mitigation and energy security, traditional forecasting models like ARIMA often struggle with the inherent non-linearity and variability in energy data, especially in developing nations. To address these limitations, the study compares conventional ARIMA models with hybrid Grey-Box models that integrate ARIMA (white-box) and Random Forest (black-box) techniques. The best-fitting ARIMA models: ARIMA (0,2,1) for Angola, Canada, and France, and ARIMA (1,1,1) for Nigeria, were effective in modeling linear trends but failed to fully capture non-linear behaviors. The Grey-Box models, by incorporating machine learning, significantly enhanced forecasting accuracy and model robustness. Performance metrics revealed major improvements: Angola’s MSE dropped from 214.78 to 2.10, and Canada’s from 20.24 to 0.06; similar gains were noted for France and Nigeria. Forecasts suggest increasing renewable energy consumption in Angola, Canada, and France, while Nigeria shows stable but high levels. Overall, the Grey-Box approach outperforms traditional models by better handling non-linear patterns. This highlights the potential of integrating statistical and machine learning methods for more reliable energy demand forecasting, particularly in countries with complex energy systems."}}

By age 25, Black adults, those who grew up in low-income families, and those raised in the Southeast or Appalachia already have significantly lower credit scores than other groups, and these differences persist throughout adulthood. These gaps translate into smaller credit balances, more credit inquiries, higher credit utilization, and greater reliance on high-cost alternative financial services. Evaluating two definitions of algorithmic bias yields opposing results. Scores are miscalibrated against traditionally advantaged groups: conditional on a score, Black and low-parental-income individuals fall delinquent more often. Yet scores are unbalanced against traditionally disadvantaged groups: among borrowers with no future delinquency, Black and low-parental-income individuals receive lower scores. Eliminating both biases and reducing gaps in credit access requires reducing systematic differences in delinquencies, which emerge in one’s twenties through missed payments on credit cards, student loans, and other bills. Comprehensive measures of individuals’ income profiles and observed wealth explain only a small portion of these repayment gaps. In contrast, most geographic variation in repayment reflects the causal effect of childhood exposure to place. Counties that promote upward mobility also promote repayment and expand credit access, suggesting that common place-level factors may drive behaviors in both credit and labor markets. We discuss suggestive evidence for several mechanisms of our results, including the role of social and cultural capital. We conclude that gaps in credit access by race, class, and hometown have roots in childhood environments.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34053\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

We identify a novel failure mode of the widely used First-Order Approach (FOA), which can arise even when the agent’s expected utility is strictly unimodal. This failure arises because, when the outcome support shifts with the agent’s effort, the agent’s utility may not be everywhere differentiable under the optimal contract, causing maximization to occur at a kink point rather than at a stationary point as assumed by the FOA. Motivated by this “kink failure,” we introduce an Implementation Relaxation Approach (IRA) that accommodates such issues. The IRA is simple, broadly applicable to both fixed- and shifting-support settings, and does not require the assumption of a monotonically increasing likelihood ratio. Using the IRA, we derive general conditions for the optimality of quota-bonus contracts. Our conditions not only guarantee the existence of the optimal contract, but, perhaps surprisingly, are even more general than the endogenous FOA-validity assumptions used in the literature. As a result, they are also more general than any exogenous conditions that justify the FOA.\n </div>\n</div>"}}

We propose two algorithms, a constraint-based structure learning method, called PC-stable-transfer learning (PCS-TL), and a score-based method, called hill climbing transfer learning (HC-TL). We also define particular metrics to tackle the negative transfer problem in each of them, a situation in which transfer learning has a negative impact on the model's performance. Then, for the parameters, we propose a log-linear pooling approach. For the evaluation, we learn kernel density estimation Bayesian networks, a type of nonparametric Bayesian network, and compare their transfer learning performance with the models alone. To do so, we sample data from small, medium and large-sized synthetic networks and datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository.&nbsp; Then, we add noise and modifications to these datasets to test their ability to avoid negative transfer. To conclude, we perform a Friedman test with a Bergmann-Hommel <i>post-hoc</i> analysis to show statistical proof of the enhanced experimental behavior of our methods. Thus, PCS-TL and HC-TL demonstrate to be reliable algorithms for improving the learning performance of a nonparametric Bayesian network with scarce data, which in real industrial environments implies a reduction in the required time to deploy the network."}}

As these non-horizontal mergers have become more common, there is increasing interest in evaluating both potential efficiencies such as eliminating double marginalization and potential anticompetitive effects such as foreclosure and recapture. The mergers we study – hospital acquisitions of physician practices – have reshaped the $1 trillion US physician industry, nearly doubling the share of physicians working for hospitals between 2008 and 2016. We combine novel data and machine learning algorithms to identify a large number of integration events, spanning a wide range of markets with different competitive circumstances. We merge the integration events with claims data from a large national insurer to study their effects on prices. Focusing on childbirths, the most ubiquitous admission among the privately insured, we find that, on average, these mergers led to price increases for hospitals and physicians of 3.3% and 15.1%, respectively, with no discernible effects on quality measures. Using demand estimation to characterize substitution patterns for both physicians and hospitals, we construct tests that demonstrate price increases are larger among transactions with greater scope for foreclosure and recapture. Our estimates suggest that the costs of these mergers of hospitals and physicians have been substantial, and our mechanism tests offer guidance in predicting where the anticompetitive effects of non-horizontal mergers are likely to be strongest.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;34039\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>"}}

Moreover, the tax system’s redistributive capacity will be enhanced, with reduced income inequality and lower poverty rates envisaged after the reform. The estimated cost of the reform is significant, with revenue from personal income tax expected to decline by €168 million in 2025, or 0.7% of nominal GDP. This, however, does not take into account certain factors that might dampen this decline. Additionally, simulations using MEDSEA, the Bank’s DSGE model, suggest that a permanent reduction in the effective labour tax rate will boost consumption and hours worked, resulting in a net positive effect on real GDP of up to 0.4%."}}
