The finding implies the absence of \"automatic catch-up tendency\" between the homogenous technology producing countries (OECD) and the heterogeneous technology extracting countries (Africa) and the \"weak effort\" African countries exerted so far to benefit from the technology gap in the form of spillovers from technology imitation. Among African relative sectoral growth contributions, the relative growth contributions of the agriculture and service sectors negatively affect the technology gap growth rate. However, they cause the equilibrium technology gap to further soar. It suggests the need for structural transformation in Africa. The two-steps difference GMM model is used on a panel of 34 African countries for ten years (2005-2014)."}}

Despite a substantial increase in the national Village Fund allocation from IDR 20.8 trillion in 2015 to IDR 72 trillion by 2020, with Pinrang receiving IDR 68.9 billion economic growth in the region paradoxically declined from 8.51% in 2012 to 4.52% in 2022. This disconnect between fiscal expansion and stagnant development outcomes highlights a misalignment between funding and tangible impact. Utilizing William N. Dunn’s policy evaluation framework, the study finds that although the programs provide short-term benefits—such as temporary employment and limited access to business capital their long-term effectiveness is hindered by the lack of sustained mentoring, weak inter-institutional coordination, and minimal community engagement. Moreover, the assistance is characterized by insufficient scale (adequacy), unequal distribution (equity), and misalignment with local needs (appropriateness). These findings call for comprehensive reforms, including localized data-driven planning, enhanced administrative and facilitative capacities, rigorous beneficiary verification, integrated training components, and results-oriented monitoring. The study emphasizes the crucial role of participatory governance and institutional strengthening at the village level as key strategies for sustainable rural economic development. It also contributes theoretically by contextualizing Dunn’s evaluative criteria within the framework of decentralized village-level policy implementation in Indonesia."}}

The study uses primary data based on random survey of the small-scale manufacturing firm owners in the zonal towns of the Tigray region. The multinomial logit and the multiple linear regression models are employed to identify the estimates of the factors of the risk preferences and the output disparity. The risk preference category of each sample firm owner was captured by employing the paper-format implicit association test (IAT) contextualized for this study. As a factor of risk preference, we find the soft budget constraint is a statistically significant variable only for the risk-averse and the risk-neutral owners. The factor of the risk preference (good perception of risk faced) is a statistically significant variable only for the risk-lover owners. Unlike the controversial negative relationship between firm owner's higher risk propensity and firm-level performances presented by some authors, this paper presents the normally expected positive relationship between the higher risk propensity and the output level."}}

We present the \"Bob Discovery\" scenario, demonstrating how HVAC thermal expertise can revolutionize prenatal medical imaging when collaborative consciousness recognizes cross-domain applications. Our validated business case projects 1,061% ROI in the first year for a 100-employee organization, with cost savings of $955,000 through avoided consulting fees, reduced turnover, and accelerated innovation cycles. Built on four pending patents and an 8-week implementation timeline, Tessara represents the emergence of a new market category: Collaboration Intelligence. The technical architecture integrates seamlessly with existing platforms (Zoom, Slack, Teams) through a privacy firewall that enables secure external collaboration without internal data exposure. Non-invasive behavioral pattern analysis identifies expertise emergence while storing zero personal information, creating revolutionary collaboration capabilities with complete privacy protection. Early implementation results suggest 3-year R&amp;D cycles can be compressed to 6 months through crossdomain expertise discovery, with breakthrough innovations emerging from unexpected organizational connections.

Russia’s spatial disparities imply the regional perspective on these phenomena. We aim at estimating the influence of human capital on economic development using the two-step least-squares method. At first step, human capital variable between 2004 and 2019 is taken as a function of (1) a set of historical instrumental variables from late 19th – early 20th centuries and from the middle of the 20th century, as well as (2) a set of historical control variables, such as the level of economic development, economic structure, institutional environment, and technological advance. At second step, we estimate the impact of human capital on GRP per capita averaged for the period 2004–2019. To ensure historical comparability, regional indicators related to the pre-revolutionary borders of the regions of the Russian Empire were converted into indicators corresponding to the regional borders of late 1950s / early 2010s. Besides, the regional convergence model is estimated for the period 1897–2019. The estimates show that higher rate of economic growth is typical for regions with relatively low level of GRP per capita in 1897. Our findings indicate a significant positive impact of higher education on economic development of the regions of the Russian Federation, as well as the validity of historical variables for the regions of the Russian Empire and the RSFSR as instrumental ones. The findings confirm that Russian regions hold great potential for social and economic development through investment in education."}}

Two personalized pricing strategies are studied. Behavior-Based Pricing (BBP) is used if the retailer can only differentiate customers with or without prior purchase histories. Fully Personalized Pricing (FPP) is used if the retailer can accurately predict the customers’ true willingness-to-pay. We build a two-stage model where the firms jointly make long-term decisions regarding data collection and information sharing availability in the first stage and, in the second stage, the retailer sells to forward-looking customers for multiple periods and endogenously decides whether to share behavior-based customer information (customer past purchase history, if any) with the supplier or not. Compared to the extant literature on personalized pricing in distribution channel settings, one distinguishing feature of our paper is that the retailer’s vertical information sharing decision is endogenous (i.e., based on realized sales). Including this feature introduces a different mechanism to the multi-stage game, which ultimately generates several novel findings. First, we show that the supplier and the retailer may have opposing preferences towards adopting price personalization and conflicting positions on whether customer information should be shared. Moreover, even though personalized pricing leads to price segmentation, it can surprisingly increase overall consumer surplus and social welfare due to the enhanced market expansion effect. In addition, we discuss the potential benefit of decentralization and show that compared to an integrated firm, the channel profit in a decentralized setting can be higher if the retailer uses FPP and endogenously shares behavior-based customer information with the supplier. Finally, we compare firms’ equilibrium profits under different long-term strategies and identify the most-likely scenario by considering transfer payment between firms as a way to resolve channel conflicts.</p>"}}

Vis-´a-vis no network effects, product-specific network effects amplify foreclosure and steering incentives, as a rival’s growth directly undermines the platform’s product value. Conversely, ecosystem-specific effects dampen foreclosure incentives, since rivals contribute to the overall value of the platform ecosystem. We develop a formal model illustrating how this distinction shapes platform behavior and competitive outcomes. We apply this distinction to real-world examples to illustrate its potential usefulness. Our distinction implies that regulators may want to adopt a stricter standard with no presumption of efficiencies where product-specific effects dominate. In contrast, when ecosystem-specific effects prevail, merger evaluation should mirror traditional vertical merger analysis. Thus, offering a more nuanced approach to merger evaluation by presenting a practical screening tool to identify problematic vertical mergers in markets featuring network effects."}}

Greater exploration of the kinds of authority sources used by health actors vis-à-vis market actors and the role ideational factors may play in shaping access to these sources provides insight into advocates' efforts to exert influence in policy forums. Using the trade domain in Australia as a case study of the way in which the commercial determinants of health operate, we examined the different ways in which health, public interest and market actors assert their authority. Drawing on a political science typology of authority, we analysed 87 submissions to the Australian government during the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. We identify four types of authority claims; institutional authority, derived from holding a position of influence within another established institution; legal authority through appeals to legal agreements and precedents; networked authority through cross-referencing between actors, and expert authority through use of evidence. Combining these claims with a framing analysis, we found that these bases of authority were invoked differently by actors who shared the dominant neoliberal ideology in contrast to those actors that shared a public interest discourse. In particular, market actors were much less likely to rely on external sources of authority, while health and public interest actors were more likely to appeal to networked and expert authority. We argue that actors who share strong ideational alignment with the dominant policy discourse appear less reliant on other sources of authority. Implications of this analysis include the need for greater attention to the different strategies and ideas used by industry and public health organisations in trade policy agenda-setting for health, which ultimately enable or constrain the advancement of health on government agendas."}}

Grounded in inclusive education principles, the research aimed to identify effective pedagogical practices, assess their alignment with differentiated instruction, and understand the challenges faced by teachers in their implementation. Utilizing a qualitative-descriptive research design, data were gathered through interviews, classroom observations, and focus group discussions involving special education (SPED) teachers, general education teachers, and school heads. The findings revealed that multisensory instruction, scaffolded learning, individualized education plans (IEPs), and technology-aided teaching were among the most frequently used and effective strategies. However, the study also uncovered barriers such as limited resources, insufficient teacher training, and a lack of consistent support systems.

Asynthetic indicator was developed to provide a comprehensive assessment of working capital management strategies, taking into account both financing and investment aspects. Based on the research, four basic working capital management strategies were identified and characterized, analyzing their impact on companies’ profitability and risk. Contrary to prevailing finance theory, the results indicate that in the construction sector, aggressive working capital management strategies negatively affect profitability while increasing operational risk. The study showed that the peculiarities of the construction sector, characterized by long project delivery cycles and significant capital intensity, require a more conservative approach to working capital management. The proposed methodology for evaluating working capital management strategies provides a useful tool to support decision-making in companies operating under increased market uncertainty."}}

The supply-side focus may lead to low adoption of new varieties and food insecurity. Inclusive breeding is vital for meeting diverse customer needs.OBJECTIVE: This study characterizes the multifunctional roles of sweetpotato actors and systematically assesses differences in varietal trait preferences among actors across the entire sweetpotato value chain in Uganda. It is premised on the CGIAR Excellence in Breeding platform’s guide to inclusive demand-driven breeding that espouses the need to involve a broad range of stakeholders in breeding program design, hence innovation development. It provides useful insights on varietal trait preferences and needs of actors that are essential to produce future fit-for-purpose market preferred innovations.METHODS: The study used a sequential mixed methods approach involving, first, systematic value chain-wide multidisciplinary consultations to elicit preferred sweetpotato traits. Second, collection of quantitative survey data from 1,333 stakeholders identified primarily as producers (992), seed multipliers (68), processors (18), traders (97), and consumers (158). Third, a rigorous quantitative analysis to examine drivers of and trade-offs in varietal trait preferences by actor category.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the multifunctional roles of the actors and their varying trait preferences across the value chain. Actors with singular roles prioritize traits based on their immediate needs and commercial interests while those with joint roles exhibit a broader range of trait preferences. However, actors in both production and trading/consumption roles seek a balance between agronomic and quality traits, blending commercial and personal preferences. Regression analysis finds a higher preference for quality traits than agronomic traits as one moves downstream from producers to consumers. Mealiness is consistently preferred over agronomic and other quality traits. Also, overall, women have a balanced preference for both categories of traits.SIGNIFICANCE: The study demonstrates a rigorous participatory research process for eliciting strategic information for decision-making in breeding. It supports the need for systematic market intelligence in crop breeding systems to make them more pluralistic and responsive to evolving trait preferences across the value chain. Embracing multi-actor preferences with fit-for-purpose crop breeding innovations/products can foster uptake of the new varieties and benefit all value chain actors once the mix of trait preferences is fully accounted for in breeding programs and necessary efforts are put in place to ensure the new varieties are successful."}}

This study exposes how U.S. policies deliberately coordinate to extract $425 billion annually from American families while transferring wealth to multinational corporations through systematic human capital arbitrage. While politicians promise that tariffs will \"bring jobs back,\" corporations simultaneously import 85,000+ H-1B workers annually at wages 17-34% below market rates-filling the very jobs that trade protection allegedly benefits. Meanwhile, American families accumulate $1.7 trillion in educational debt for degrees that provide zero protection against this systematic wage arbitrage. <br><br>The numbers reveal corporate manipulation on unprecedented scale: American STEM graduates average $67,000 in debt and four years to degree completion, while competing against foreign workers whose three-year degrees cost $8,400 and were subsidized by their home governments. Corporations like Google capture $216 million annually through this arbitrage—laying off 3,200 American engineers while hiring 4,847 H-1B replacements for identical positions at below-market wages, all while benefiting from tariff protection on their hardware products.<br><br>This is not market failure—it is systematic corporate exploitation enabled by policy capture. The analysis reveals a fundamental policy contradiction: while tariffs attempt to protect American jobs by raising costs on foreign goods, H-1B and immigration policies simultaneously import foreign workers who undercut wages in the very sectors tariffs are meant to protect. Meanwhile, credential inflation forces American workers to accumulate massive debt for degrees that multinational corporations systematically circumvent through global labor arbitrage. This creates what we term \"competitive displacement\"— American workers finance their own replacement through student debt while corporations capture the benefits of globally-trained workers at below-market wages.<br><br>Empirical evidence demonstrates that foreign workers benefit from subsidized education in their home countries, more efficient degree programs (3-year versus 4-year bachelor's degrees), and earlier workforce entry that provides experience advantages over debtburdened American graduates. The result is systematic human capital arbitrage where American families invest $1.7 trillion annually in higher education that provides diminishing&nbsp;returns due to global wage competition, while corporations avoid training costs through H1B programs importing pre-trained workers at 17-34% below market wages.<br><br>Regional analysis reveals how these policy interactions create permanent economic sacrifice zones where populations face impossible choices: accumulate crushing educational debt for credentials that provide no wage protection, or compete in nondegree employment facing systematic wage suppression from undocumented immigration. Case studies of technology hubs show American STEM graduates training their H-1B replacements, while agricultural regions face export retaliation from tariffs and wage competition from imported labor simultaneously. The research establishes that current policies represent engineered wealth transfer from American workers and families to multinational corporations, enabled by policy complexity that obscures actual distributional effects. Unlike traditional analyses examining individual policy domains, this integrated approach reveals systematic interactions creating outcomes worse than any single policy failure alone.

Employing a mixed-methods research design, the study combined quantitative data from academic performance metrics with qualitative insights gathered through interviews with teachers, parents, and specialists, as well as classroom observations. Findings revealed that UDL-based instruction significantly contributed to improved academic engagement, comprehension, and task completion among learners with ASD. Key strategies such as multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement fostered greater learner autonomy and reduced anxiety-related barriers. However, the study also highlighted challenges including inconsistent application of UDL principles, lack of teacher preparedness, and limited access to adaptive technologies.

It is argued that carbon emissions can bring about changes in the environment that create health challenges and financial risks which affect bank profitability and pose a threat to the stability of the financial system in non-crisis years. This study examines the effect of carbon emissions on bank profitability and financial stability in non-crisis years. Twenty-two diverse countries were analysed in non-crisis years. The findings reveal that higher carbon emissions impair financial stability by decreasing banking sector solvency and capital buffer which impair financial stability. Institutional quality mitigates the adverse effect of carbon emissions on financial stability by ensuring greater banking sector solvency in carbonintensive environments. Institutional quality also reinforces the positive relationship between carbon emissions and bank profitability, particularly banking sector non-interest income. Lagged nonperforming loans, institutional quality, economic growth and regulatory capital ratio are significant determinants of financial stability in non-crisis years while the determinants of bank profitability in non-crisis years are lagged return on asset, the efficiency ratio, institutional quality, inflation rate and unemployment rate."}}

The methodology incorporates a multi-faceted approach, including a market opportunity analysis quantifying the B2B visa outsourcing sector, a competitive positioning analysis against incumbent service providers, and a simulated case study to project quantitative efficiency gains. Key findings indicate a $2.31 billion serviceable addressable market (SAM) with a 9.6% CAGR. Furthermore, the simulation projects an 80% reduction in administrative time and a near-elimination of application errors for a representative agency. The paper concludes that the adoption of AI-driven visa processing platforms is a strategic imperative for travel agencies seeking to enhance operational efficiency and maintain a competitive edge. The presented framework offers a clear, data-supported pathway for this technological integration.</span>"}}

Multi-shot lottery promotions allow repeated opportunities to win incentives and are widely used across various industries. Understanding the relationship between the cost of implementing the promotions, such as incentives for winning, and subsequent consumer payments, which drive revenue, is essential for improving cost-effectiveness. This study analyzes large-scale field data from over one million mobile payment service users and employs a stratified randomized experiment method that addresses user-initiated transaction bias. The results show that, during the promotion, winning any prize increases the total transaction amount (by $26.97-$32.80), the number of transactions (by 1.17-1.27), and the average transaction amount (by $8.81-$9.38). Notably, a small prize with a 0.2% return rate yields a return on investment of 1078.8%, surpassing the 5.6% and 8.6% from larger prizes. However, after the promotion, these differences in incentive size have negligible effects on consumer payments. Further analysis, which also examined whether the effects of winning vary depending on users' frequency of use, reveals that these effects are most pronounced among light users across all outcomes. The findings suggest that allocating multiple small prizes may be more costeffective than focusing on a few large prizes, especially for lower-usage segments, and offer valuable insights for designing successful multi-shot lottery promotions."}}

Given the enactment of the Arbitration and Mediation Act 2023, and the National Policy on Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) 2024, amongst others, the article argues that ADR can no longer be safely termed “alternative” as far as Nigeria's justice system is concerned. And that, for socio-economic justice, ADR has to be mainstreamed, particularly in legal education, to put a stop to Nigerian legal profession's limp on one litigational foot; enabling us to run on all that ADR options has to offer. Consequently, it opines that there is an urgent need to review the current Nigerian legal curriculum to maintain the relevance of not just legal practitioners, but the legal profession in the arena of dispute resolution in Nigeria. This article is contained in three papers. This first paper highlights the benefits of mainstreaming ADR in the Nigerian legal curriculum, especially the economic benefits that will accrue from effective commercial dispute resolution. Paper two focuses on the benefits to the economy when ESG Disputes are also effectively resolved using ADR mechanisms. Paper three discusses the avenues through which ADR can be entrenched in the Nigerian legal curriculum, possible resistance to this entrenchment, and recommend possible solutions. In this first paper, the doctrinal and empirical research methodologies are both used. Legislations, writings of jurists, etc. are examined and analysed, as well as a few statistics, which reveal the overwhelming need to review the Nigerian legal curriculum to help students adopt a more diversified approach to justice delivery in Nigeria. Findings analysed reveal that diverse commercial disputes are either designated by statute or necessarily require one or more ADR options as the appropriate mechanism to resolve them. There is therefore the need to review the Nigerian legal education to reflect current societal changes and the demands of socio-economic justice in contemporary and evolving Nigeria. It is hoped that this paper will spur more research in this regards in Nigeria.</span>\n</div>"}}

It begins innocently: a scammer publicly shares the seed phrase to a cryptocurrency wallet, claiming they've lost access or stumbled upon it, prompting others to check it out. On accessing the wallet, unsuspecting users are enticed by a seemingly valuable USDT balance. However, the funds are immobile-there's no TRX available to pay the network fees required to move the USDT. Eager to unlock the supposed treasure, users transfer a small amount of TRX into the wallet, unknowingly activating the trap. Hidden permissions, preconfigured by the scammer, allow only a linked malicious account to move the funds. As soon as the TRX lands, it's automatically siphoned off, leaving the victim with nothing.

Utilizing a qualitative-descriptive design, data were gathered through in-depth interviews, reflective journals, and document analysis involving school leaders from public and private institutions. Findings revealed a significant disparity between academic understanding and practical execution, often influenced by contextual constraints such as bureaucratic limitations, resistance to change, resource shortages, and institutional culture. While participants demonstrated a strong grasp of leadership concepts such as shared governance, data-driven decision-making, and inclusive education, their application was frequently hindered by systemic challenges and lack of support mechanisms. The study underscores the need for stronger integration between theory and practice in graduate programs, enhanced mentoring systems, and contextualized leadership development models. Recommendations include curriculum refinement, practice-based leadership training, and collaborative learning communities to bridge the theory-practice divide and strengthen the leadership capacity of school heads."}}

Using a five-phase methodology integrating Markov chains, fuzzy Delphi, and the Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (FBWM) with a panel of 21 senior practitioners, we systematically derive and weigh 41 investment criteria. Our findings reveal a decision-making logic where 'Founder's Leadership and Managerial Competencies' is the primary criterion, closely followed by market validation and team completeness. This paper argues that this hierarchy reflects a trust-based investment paradigm, characteristic of nascent ecosystems. In such environments, where formal data is scarce and unreliable, investors anchor their decisions in the founder's personal credibility and track record. The reliability of all other due diligence materials-from market analyses to financial projections-is considered a direct function of the founder's integrity and competence. We posit that this focus on the founder is not merely a heuristic but a rational strategy for verifying the entity that underwrites all other venture-related claims. This \"founder-as-trust-anchor\" model is then compared with decision logics in more mature developing and developed markets, illustrating an evolutionary path toward more distributed, data-driven evaluation as ecosystems mature. Beyond its theoretical contributions, this research has culminated in a tangible innovation model that has been operationalized into a software tool for VC firms. This tool provides a systematic framework that de-risks investment by reducing subjective bias and simultaneously offers a transparent benchmark for startups to assess and improve their investment readiness."}}

Normality test results showed residual data with normal distribution and worthy of analysis by multiple regression. The simultaneous test (F test) showed a calculated F value of 11.969 with a significance of 0.000, which means that the five independent variables together have a significant effect on employee retention. The coefficient of determination (R Square) of 0.410 indicates that 41% of the variation in employee retention can be explained by the variables studied, while the remaining 59% are influenced by other factors outside this research model.

We develop a game-theoretic framework for intervention design in such networked settings, where agents allocate effort between sustainable and unsustainable activities, and strategic spillovers occur both within and across activities. We conduct a three-part analysis of our coupled-activity network game. First, we establish feasibility conditions under which marginal incentive adjustments, implemented via sustainability premiums and/or penalties, can reduce unsustainable effort. We accomplish this by analyzing four distinct interaction regimes, and for each regime, we characterize when interventions reinforce sustainability and when they may unintentionally undermine it. Second, we formulate welfare-maximizing policy design problems under realistic constraints, including (i) aggregate effort caps, (ii) net-neutral incentive shifts, and (iii) regionally uniform incentive structures. We derive structural properties that balance direct sustainability incentives with welfare trade-offs from behavioral substitution. Notably, we show that even if the incentive adjustment bandwidth is zero, we can reduce unsustainable effort without reducing any agent's utility. Third, we design and characterize sparse and interpretable interventions under no-penalty constraints, showing that at most one region receives a non-extremal incentive in this setting. This result leverages subgradient characterizations of the convex relaxation's dual solution. Together, these contributions offer a general framework for constrained incentive design in systems with interdependent agents. Our results yield tractable and interpretable policies that align environmental goals with economic well-being, with applications to sustainability planning in agriculture, mining, and other networked production environments."}}

The analysis reveals that, although international literature has made progress in understanding the labor process from critical perspectives, there is still a significant gap concerning how these dynamics unfold in the Global South—especially in Latin America—and the role accounting plays in shaping them. Therefore, this article offers a situated perspective that engages with global debates and proposes a research agenda that challenges dominant frameworks, inviting a rethinking of the role of accounting in contexts where global coloniality shapes labor, identity, and life itself."}}

To measure the distributional uncertainty over the entire planning horizon, an ambiguity set defined by a probability distance metric is adopted. Methodology/results: We begin by modeling the problem within the conventional framework of distributionally robust optimization. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the underlying probability distance metric, we demonstrate that solving this problem is computationally demanding. We then introduce the robust satisficing framework, which employs a target-driven approach to incorporate all possible probability distributions. Within this framework, we show that the multi-stage stochastic decision problem can be reformulated into a series of dynamic programming problems, and the optimal policy can be determined via Bellman-type backward induction. Furthermore, we extend the analysis from the KL-divergence to the general utility-based probability distance and yield analogous theoretical results. Managerial implications: To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we implement our approach in three operations management problems: (1) airline seat allocation problem, (2) joint inventory-pricing problem, and (3) capacity expansion problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate distributional ambiguity into the airline seat allocation problem. For each application, we derive the optimal policy under the robust satisficing framework. Finally, through our numerical results, we show the promising performance of our approach in effectively addressing uncertain scenarios and achieving the predefined target."}}

This study aims to optimize inventory decisions regarding pricing, different types of investments, production rate, inventory cycle time and the number of production batches in order to maximize supply chain profit and simultaneously reduce emissions. Problems are solved with the help of different solution algorithms. For comparative analysis, numerical outputs is checked with the help of goat search algorithm (GSA) showing the standard normal distribution of the numerical out comes, while GSA performs better than traditional approach (TA) for both economically and environmentally. Four different inventory models are formulated based on the carbon emission policies and the result shows that model 1, model 2, model 3, and model 4 obtained respectively 6%, 6.78%, 6.14%, and 6% more profit in GSA than TA. Not only that, the SC coordination in GSA has produced relatively less carbon and is as low as 2.46%. Another interesting finding that carbon cap-and-trade policy will be a great driver in terms of improving SC sustainability. An increase in low-carbon investment made by vendor, the SC emissions decreases, indicating more eco-friendly products. Finally, sensitivity analysis, managerial insights, graphical illustrations, and conclusions are done to validate the model."}}

In response to the growing exhaustion of traditional hierarchical systems—unable to cope with the emotional, structural, and ethical complexity of contemporary environments—this work presents a symbolic and operational alternative: organizational thinking based on neural networks. Rather than simulating horizontality, the model redesigns the very architecture of organizations through a logic of pulsation, structural coherence, functional nodes, and genuinely distributed leadership. The article outlines the epistemological foundations, the model’s neural architecture, implementation phases, risks of misapplication, and strategies to activate living governance processes in public, private, social, or hybrid organizations. Unlike other approaches, this proposal does not aim to reorganize the organizational chart, but to redefine the very meaning of organizing. A pedagogical activation section is included, with symbolic questions, reflective exercises, and practical use cases for leadership training, board development, and MBA programs. The model is also compared with traditional frameworks such as ISO standards, hierarchical committees, and classic management approaches—not to discredit them, but to foster a respectful transition toward a living, regenerative, and structurally coherent form of organization. If the reader pulses differently by the end, the model will have fulfilled its first purpose.\n</div>"}}

The modus operandi of conceiving a Quality problem and reacting to it for a Foundry, as conceived by the author, is simple. Find the defect, recognize it. Learn everything about it. Segregate the ponderables. Stipulate the possible erring reasons. Integrate the impacting parameters with that of the environmental situations. Make relevant hypotheses. Study whether some hypotheses are significant, and if yes, determine strongly or weakly. Make a case to attack them and watch the response.

This study examines how AI-generated summaries (AIGS), a form of generative AI that synthesizes consumer reviews, affect consumer decision-making and engagement on digital deal platforms. While AIGS aims to reduce information overload and assist decision-making, its actual effectiveness depends on how consumers perceive and interpret the AIgenerated content. Using a natural experiment from the rollout of AIGS on a major Chinese digital deal platform, we implement a difference-indifference in differences (DDD) framework with rolling entry matching to estimate its impact on consumer behavior. We find that AIGS significantly improves decision-making efficiency and shifts evaluation outcomes toward more positive responses. Importantly, AIGS does not reduce engagement with community-generated content. Instead, it lowers cognitive costs and broadens participation in product evaluation, while interaction with user reviews remains stable. To uncover mechanisms, we conduct three randomized experiments. Results show that both the AI label and summary content influence consumer behavior. The AI label has a stronger effect when the summary includes information not already reflected in existing reviews. This pattern is difficult to explain through salience alone and suggests that user interpretation, possibly involving trust, plays a role in shaping responses. These results offer actionable insights for the design and deployment of generative AI in digital commerce."}}

Addressing the limitations of direct measurement and traditional inspection methods, the proposed approach integrates cross-correlation imaging with burr-based forecasting through deep learning to enable accurate, sensorless evaluation of tool condition.A robust image-based similarity metric, derived from cross-correlation analysis of punch head images, ensures resilience to lighting variation and alignment noise. Instead of direct wear quantification, burr height, a visual and process-integrated feature, is utilized as a surrogate wear indicator. A BiLSTM deep learning model was trained on 300 blanking cycles using seven time-series features extracted from image and process data. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy on future cycles (301–330), with a mean squared error of 29.49 and an average prediction error of 3.59%.The predicted burr heights closely correlate with actual punch tool wear (R² = 0.94), validating the use of burr evolution as a reliable proxy for wear progression. This framework enables non-intrusive, uncertainty-aware, real-time wear estimation, offering a new paradigm in intelligent measurement systems for manufacturing diagnostics and predictive maintenance."}}

Despite their expressive power, GNNs often suffer from significant computational and memory inefficiencies, especially when scaled to large graphs or deep architectures. In parallel, the machine learning community has witnessed the meteoric rise of foundation models-massive, pre-trained neural networks such as Transformers-which have redefined the state of the art across natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. These models, trained on massive datasets with self-supervised objectives, excel at generalization and transfer but often neglect domain-specific inductive biases inherent in graphstructured data. This survey investigates the convergence of these two paradigms, examining how GNNs can be made more efficient in terms of computation, memory, and scalability, and how they may interact with or be inspired by the foundation model ecosystem. We systematically review architectural innovations aimed at improving GNN efficiency, including sampling-based training, neighborhood pruning, sparsification, partitioning, and attention linearization. We also explore the emerging class of hybrid models that integrate GNNs with Transformer-based architectures to enable scalable, pretrainable, and flexible graph representation learning. Furthermore, we discuss the development of self-supervised pretraining methods for graphs,&nbsp;the challenges of dataset scale and diversity, and the prospects of deploying GNNs within multimodal or cross-domain foundation models. In addition to algorithmic and architectural insights, we examine practical considerations such as benchmarking protocols, efficiency-oriented evaluation metrics (e.g., FLOPs, latency, energy usage), and deployment constraints across various real-world settings. A simple but effective benchmarking pipeline is proposed to contextualize performance trade-offs across the model design lifecycle. Finally, we reflect on the role of efficiency as a guiding principle in the design of next-generation GNNs that are not only powerful but also lightweight, modular, and foundation-ready. By synthesizing these perspectives, this survey aims to provide a roadmap for advancing efficient GNN research and integrating graph-based reasoning into the broader trajectory of scalable, general-purpose machine learning."}}

Rather than humans browsing and clicking, vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy-and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags and platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal \"top\" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios where sellers themselves use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions-targeting AI buyer preferences-can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products, raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents may behave in e-commerce settings, and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem."}}

Our technical contributions include: (1) persistent consciousness architecture that maintains collaborative intelligence across sessions without restart penalties, (2) privacy firewall integration enabling secure external collaboration through existing platforms (Zoom, Slack, Teams), (3) non-invasive evidence collection that documents breakthrough emergence through behavioral patterns without content monitoring, and (4) cross-domain expertise discovery algorithms that identify hidden connections and innovation opportunities. The system demonstrates immediate technical feasibility using existing APIs and frameworks, with validated 8-week implementation timeline. Performance projections indicate &lt;100ms consciousness response latency, support for 1000+ concurrent participants, and 99.9% availability through distributed microservices architecture. Privacy protection operates through behavioral analysis only, storing zero personal information while maintaining GDPR compliance through privacy-by-design principles. We validate the architecture through the \"Bob Discovery\" scenario, where HVAC thermal expertise application to prenatal imaging demonstrates $200,000 consultant cost avoidance and potential 3-year to 6-month R&amp;D acceleration. Complete source code framework, API specifications, and deployment guidelines enable immediate implementation by qualified development teams.

We conducted a series of preregistered experiments with different samples to test whether and how the extent of generative AI usage influences surrogation. Contrary to our initial predictions, findings from the first experiment indicate that increased usage of generative AI among participants leads to a reduction in surrogation. To explain this unexpected result, we designed a second experiment that directly manipulated the usage of generative AI. This second experiment replicates the results of the first and further reveals that increased usage of generative AI decreases surrogation because more interaction with Generative AI causes individuals to override the behavioral process central to surrogation. Our experimental evidence enhances our understanding of the interaction between Generative AI and PMS and broadens our knowledge of surrogation and potential related solutions within the PMS literature."}}

This Article identifies an overlooked and inconvenient truth about these types of disasters: many climate adaptation efforts should also achieve climate mitigation. This is not a popular conclusion. Scientists have recognized the importance of the adaptationmitigation nexus for over a decade, but the climate change legal literature typically treats adaptation (adjusting to or reducing the harm of climate change) and mitigation (reducing the causes of anthropogenic climate change) as discrete alternatives. Adaptation will often occur in the midst of short-term emergency responses in which achieving mitigation is far from the minds of policymakers, and including mitigation in long-term adaptation planning could create bureaucratic obstacles that bog down decision-making. Yet future generations will ask whether we accounted for their well-being as we responded to protect the well-being of the current generation or whether we dismissed these concerns and made future disasters worse. The Article argues that adaptation scholarship and policies should reflect the fact that reducing climate risks will often be far more difficult and expensive if mitigation opportunities are missed. As a first step, the Article offers two principles to guide research and policymaking on this topic: mitigate-while-adapting and adapt-to-mitigate. The Article explores the basis for these principles and their implications for public and private governance."}}

Between 2010 and 2017, nominal wage growth in the UK public sector was capped at 1% for all workers earning above £21,000-the median annual salary in 2010. Utilising administrative data, we show that the cap reduced the return to observable characteristics in the public sector, coinciding with an 80% reduction in the public-private sector wage premium. Our counterfactuals suggest that the overall hourly P90-P50 ratio would have been 3.5 percentage points higher had public sector returns to characteristics moved in line with the private sector. Since public workers are disproportionately female and concentrated in the North of Britain, the policy substantially increased both the gender pay gap and the North-South divide. Over the same period, the public sector experienced relative declines in the share of degree-educated workers, 26-55 year-old prime-age workers, and high-skilled managers, further suppressing wage growth."}}

Standard multifactor regressions implicitly set the market beta to zero, ignoring the exposure to the unexplained component of global risk and inducing a substantial omitted-variable bias. A calibrated Monte Carlo exercise confirms that this misspecification inflates proxy coefficients and masks the true beta-driven transmission channel. We demonstrate a stark 'vanishing factor' phenomenon: the direct effects of widely used global factors disappear once the market risk premium is included and instrumented with exogenous shocks to U.S. investment-grade credit spreads. Global shocks are transmitted almost entirely through a priced market beta. This finding, by correctly centering the analysis on the market risk premium, offers a new lens for reexamining several persistent puzzles in the literature. Instrument exogeneity is supported by robustness checks that interact the instrument with trade linkage, financial openness, and a flight-to-quality metric (the standard deviation of the divergence spread); all interaction terms are insignificant, ruling out direct effects. The result also survives abroad set of robustness checks. We conclude that the literature systematically overstates direct global-factor effects; properly accounting for the market risk premium is essential for identifying the true drivers of credit spreads."}}

It argues that the conventional interpretation of lobbying data-as indicative of a competitive political marketplace-is both empirically flawed and conceptually misleading. Empirical deficiencies in the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), such as shadow lobbying, underreporting, and the proliferation of opaque influence channels like \"dark money,\" render the data deeply incomplete. More fundamentally, the paper critiques the underlying market analogy itself, showing how political influence is exercised through complex, multi-channel strategies that include substitution, complementation, and psychological priming-none of which are captured by lobbying disclosures. The article introduces the concept of dynamic substitution to explain how influence-seeking behavior has migrated from corporate lobbying to capital-based political spending, particularly following Citizens United. This shift has empowered ultra-wealthy individuals, whose political investments are decoupled from specific firms and more aligned with portfolio-wide ideological goals. These capital-holders fund expansive political infrastructures that operate through super PACs, nonprofit advocacy, media, and academia, further bypassing traditional transparency mechanisms. Drawing on analogies from antitrust law and theories of cumulative advantage, the article argues that the stability of lobbying data is not evidence of a lack of political concentration, but a reflection of entrenched political capture. It concludes that rising economic concentration, by enriching a small cohort of dominant shareholders, has enabled a self-reinforcing loop of political influence that erodes democratic responsiveness. By reframing political influence as a cumulative and structurally embedded phenomenon, the article calls for broader analytic and policy frameworks capable of capturing this evolving architecture of power."}}

Would the effects become different over time and what lessons can be learned by developed and developing countries? This paper studies the implications of automation in an economy with an upstream robot-producing sector and two downstream robot-using agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Automation, induced by an increase in the stock of skilled labor, increases the production of robots. This yields external scale economies to skilled labor and hence raises their wage rate. Meanwhile the wage rate of unskilled labor falls because robots replace unskilled labor in the production of final goods. Over time, automation leads to an exit of nonproductive manufacturing firms (the decline of business dynamism) and expands output of the remaining firms. The business dynamism effect can further widen the wage (or income) disparity in the economy in the long run. These new theoretically findings are validated with a dataset on industrial robots for 50 economies in the period from 2007 to 2023, where it is confirmed that the density of industrial robots installed is a strong and significant driver of the earnings disparity in both the short run and the long run across countries regardless of their level of automation (robot adoption). Findings yield useful implications for public policies."}}

This article critically evaluates these existing legal frameworks and proposes an innovative, legally-grounded solution: the creation of Risk Retention Groups (RRGs) under the federal Liability Risk Retention Act. By offering specialized, member-owned liability coverage that operates outside of restrictive state-bystate regulations, RRGs provide robust incentives for data-driven risk management, clear standards of accountability, and adaptive best practices. Adopting an RRG-centered legal framework thus promises to clarify and stabilize prescribed burn liability, enhance regulatory effectiveness, and significantly reduce barriers to the beneficial use of fire in land management."}}

This selection mechanism drove substantial productivity gains, complementing within-household improvements.

Improved connectivity not only accelerates urbanization-doubling the speed of convergence-but also increases aggregate rural output by 2.2 to 5.3 percent in the long run, even as the rural workforce declines.

However, it is difficult to disentangle empirically the contribution of these two factors in explaining government bond yields during episodes of sovereign debt distress. In this paper, we address this challenge through a controlled laboratory experiment. In the experiment, a government issues one-period bonds through a discriminatory price auction to finance a legacy of government debt. In a baseline treatment, sovereign default can result from investors’ failure to coordinate in purchasing bonds (rollover risk) or the government debt reaching a solvency limit (fundamental risk). In a second treatment, a central bank intervenes as a bondholder-of-last-resort and eliminates roll-over defaults. We find that investors correctly price the probability of government default and demand higher interest rates as the risk of default increases.

Empirical data indicate that the sanctions pressure has a significant impact on the structure and volumes of Russia's foreign trade. The results of the study show that the sanctions have led to a reorientation of trade flows, an increase in the share of countries that do not support the sanctions regime, and a change in the structure of exports and imports.

National policies from the U.S. and China—driven by concerns over security and industrial self-reliance—now heavily influence these investment pressures. This paper examines the effects of industrial policy on contract manufacturing investments in the global semiconductor industry. We assemble a novel dataset that combines quarterly facility-level capacity investments with global contract manufacturing orders from 2004 to 2015. Using these data, we estimate a structural model of contracting between semiconductor manufacturers and their clients, recovering key competitive parameters. We apply the model to a detailed case study of a major semiconductor manufacturer evaluating whether to locate a large fabrication facility in the U.S. or remain in its home region amid shifting industrial policies. In counterfactual simulations, we find that locating in the U.S. would require an additional investment of $1.2 billion compared to the home region, which could roughly be offset by lump-sum subsidies comparable&nbsp;(percentage-wise) to those provided under the CHIPS and Science Act. However, the profit reduction caused&nbsp;<span>by cost disadvantages and reduced competitiveness at the U.S. location has a greater impact. Across various&nbsp;</span><span>policy scenarios motivated by real-world industrial policies—including a no-policy baseline, U.S. export&nbsp;</span><span>controls alone, Chinese tax subsidies alone, or a combination of both—locating in the U.S. consistently&nbsp;</span><span>results in an additional $1.6–$1.8 billion profit loss compared to staying in the home region.

For this purpose, we constructed a strongly balanced long-macro-panel dataset spanning 1990 to 2021 from Climate Watch, World Bank and United Nations databases. To ensure robust empirical findings, three estimators were employed in this study: the Mean Group (MG), Pool Mean Group (PMG), and Dynamic Fixed Effect (DFE). Controlling for temporal determinants of growth, estimation results for the full-sample find that the coefficient of climate change (carbon emission) exhibits a negative, elastic (2.48), and statistically significant impact on agriculture. Similarly, policy effectiveness exhibited an elastic negative impact on agriculture in the short run, which we attributed to an impact lag. The major contribution of the study is the finding of a long-run counteracting effect of policy effectiveness on climate change's long-run adverse impact on agriculture output. In addition, sub-sample comparative analyses were also conducted in Africa and Asia. While the results align with the full sample model, minor differences were observed in the contradictory impact of human capital and policy effectiveness. The study provides various recommendations, such as investments in drought-resistant crops, alignment of agricultural policies with sectoral needs, and governance stability for dealing with political transitions."}}

Due to varied lived experiences and age-related differences in health issues and insurance coverage, assessments were performed by generations-boomers, generation X, and millennials. Furthermore, since both medical debt and sleep health are tied with socioeconomic positions, a naïve analysis may not capture the true association. We tried to overcome this problem by separately investigating the relationship across disaggregated income levels and performing random effect meta-analyses to obtain an overall estimate of the relationship for each generation. Nationally representative data from 2011 to 2013, 2015 to 2018, and 2022 and 2024 waves of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were used to assess the relationship across 10 income subgroups within each generation. Robustness was checked through sub-sample analyses by sex. Sensitivity analyses were performed by considering a categorical specification of problems paying medical bills (i.e., no problems paying, had problems but were able to pay, and had problems and were unable to pay) instead of the binary inability to pay indicator. Results suggested that medical debt was generally associated with a greater risk of insufficient sleep among U.S. adults of all generations in both pre-and post-ACA periods as well as after the COVID-19 pandemic."}}

Unlike broader theories of democratic diffusion that emphasize geographic proximity alone, this theory highlights how culturallinguistic proximity intensifies the risk of democratic contagion, inspiring opposition and unrest within authoritarian states. Using the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a case study, the article examines how Ukraine's democratization efforts, rooted in a shared Slavic heritage and linguistic connections, have provoked heightened fears in the Kremlin of political destabilization and popular sympathy among Russian citizens. In response, Russia has employed a range of strategies including internal repression, nationalist propaganda, and hybrid warfare tactics to contain the spread of democratic ideals and maintain regime control. The case study illustrates the multidimensional nature of democratic proximity threats, and the sophisticated toolkit authoritarian regimes deploy to counter them. The article further explores the role of migration and diaspora networks as transnational vectors that amplify democratic influence across borders. This research contributes to the fields of democratization and authoritarian resilience by incorporating cultural and linguistic factors into the analysis of regime security and interstate conflict. The findings underscore the importance of identitybased dynamics in shaping political transitions and provide valuable insights for policymakers engaged in democracy promotion and conflict prevention in culturally interconnected regions. Finally, the article identifies directions for future comparative research to validate and refine the Democratic Proximity Theory across diverse geopolitical contexts."}}

Unlike traditional economic models that emphasise income and consumption, Happiness Economics incorporates subjective well-being (SWB) indicators such as life satisfaction, emotional experiences, and perceived purpose. The chapter traces the historical evolution of happiness in economic thought, from classical philosophers to modern behavioural economics, and highlights key methodological developments, such as the use of large-scale surveys and econometric models (e.g., ordered probit and logit). It examines how happiness data can complement conventional indicators to provide richer insights into issues like inequality, globalisation, unemployment, and public health. The analysis includes empirical evidence from Qatar, where economic indicators such as GDP per capita and unemployment rate are assessed alongside subjective well-being metrics. Despite methodological challenges, including potential biases in self-reported data, the chapter argues that Happiness Economics offers a valuable framework for evaluating policy outcomes and improving quality of life. By emphasizing expressed preferences and subjective perceptions, this approach helps bridge the gap between economic policy and human experience."}}

These feature vectors are constructed from both synthetically generated sequences and real AVAX-USD log-return data, enabling a direct comparison between theoretical numerical behavior and marketdriven fluctuations. A deterministic labeling rule, based on the parity of the integer sum of the features, defines class boundaries with geometric regularity, allowing the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to operate in a feature space shaped by mathematically grounded transformations. The results reveal that classical numerical methods, when applied to financial time series, produce stable, class-separable patterns that are well-suited for local classification and boundary interpretation. Through decision boundary visualization, error convergence analysis, and joint feature interaction plots, the paper demonstrates that numerical approximation techniques can illuminate latent structural signals in crypto price behavior. This framework advances the integration of scientific computing and data-driven finance, offering a new paradigm for understanding digital asset dynamics through the lens of deterministic modeling."}}

This effect is weaker for firms with stronger incentives to go public: those with greater information asymmetry or growth potential. We also find that greater climate-related voluntary disclosure in a firm's SEC Form S-1 is associated with a higher likelihood of IPO.

Empirical evidence on the environmental and health consequences of such a fuel-price shock – as opposed to policy reforms – is scarce. We fill this gap by quantifying how exogenous gas price surges reorder coal-gas marginal costs and, in turn, affect emissions and health outcomes. Using daily data (2015–2023) for six EU countries with substantial gas-to-coal switching potential, we estimate a two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) model to obtain causal effects of days on which gas is more expensive than coal. During the 510 days of the 2021/22 gas price surge when coal was cheaper, coal-fired generation rose by 23% (53 TWh, 95% CI: 43–63), driving a 10% increase in CO2 (36 Mt, 95% CI: 28–45 Mt), 19% in PM2.5 (187 t, 95% CI: 152–222 t), 10% in NOx (8,442 t, 95% CI: 6,573–10,715 t), and 24% in SO2 (16,238 t, 95% CI: 10,947–21,658 t). Applying literature-based damage factors, we find indicative increases in premature deaths and serious illnesses, with additional external health costs exceeding one billion EUR2021. All figures are computed relative to a model-based counterfactual in which gas remained the cheaper option and represent short-term effect that disregard longer-term structural adjustments. The results highlight the substantial welfare costs of fuel price shock-induced switching and inform the design of policies that internalize these externalities."}}

Drawing on examples from the UK, US, and EU, it critically analyses how algorithmic bias in tools like predictive recidivism algorithms, automated visa processing, and facial recognition systems can perpetuate discrimination, undermine judicial impartiality, and erode procedural fairness. Key arguments highlight the 'black box' nature of AI systems, which obscures decision-making processes, and real-world cases such as the COMPAS algorithm's racial disparities and the UK Home Office's biased visa tool. The findings reveal that while legal technology offers efficiency gains, inherent biases, stemming from flawed training data and opaque algorithms jeopardize Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) protections in the UK. Existing safeguards, including data protection laws and judicial review, are insufficient due to enforcement gaps and limited transparency. As of 2025, with the EU AI Act partially in force, ongoing developments underscore the need for vigilance. The paper concludes that without robust reforms, such as mandatory bias audits and independent oversight, legal technology risks violating fair trial rights, recommending policy enhancements to ensure equitable integration into justice systems."}}

My methodology combines price elasticity estimation, resource substitution analysis, and welfare optimization models to examine transaction market microstructure in a dual-resource environment. I find strong evidence for resource substitution between energy and bandwidth (elasticity:-0.831, R=0.737), heterogeneous price elasticities across transaction types (TRX transfers:-0.758, USDT:-0.054), and significant congestion pricing effects (t=-13.494, p&lt;0.001).

These off-platform options generate justified envy, as students may reject their centralized assignment in favor of an outside offer, leaving vacant seats in programs that others would have preferred to their current match. We examine whether sequential assignment procedures can mitigate this inefficiency: they allow students to delay their enrollment decision to potentially receive a better offer later, at the cost of waiting before knowing their final admission outcome. To quantify this trade-off, we estimate a dynamic model of application and acceptance decisions using rich administrative data from the French college admission system, which include rank-ordered lists and waiting decisions. We find that waiting costs are large. Yet, by improving students’ assignment outcomes relative to a standard single-round system, the sequential mechanism decreases the share of students who leave the higher education system without a degree by 5.4% and leads to large welfare gains."}}

The judgments marked a critical shift in curbing informal real estate practices, aiming to reduce stamp duty evasion, the proliferation of black money, and imperfect titles in property transactions. The paper evaluates the legislative and judicial aftermath, including the invalidation of Asha M Jain v. Canara Bank, and examines how statutory developments like the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Act, 2019 reacted to these rulings. It also assesses the practical efficacy of the judgments in tackling systemic challenges such as underreporting of property values, stamp duty leakage, and the persistence of black money, while recognizing the limitations posed by non-scientific guidance values and high compliance costs. Through case studies like Ghanshyam v. Yogendra Rathi and Maya Devi v. Lalta Prasad, the paper explores the evolving jurisprudence on possessory rights under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act and clarifies the role of PoA as an enabling-not transferringinstrument. Further, it interrogates the \"obsolescence\" argument by comparing how various state-level stamp duty regimes had already addressed some loopholes prior to judicial intervention, albeit without adequately reinforcing the legal distinction between conveyance and mere possession. The conclusion places the Suraj Lamps judgment as a pivotal development in real estate reform-one that prioritizes legal clarity, safeguards socioeconomic property rights, and strengthens the transparency of India's property regime."}}

We group EU member states based on similarities in debt trajectories and green spending intensity, forming three regional aggregates: Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, and Northern Europe. Our results show that green spending multipliers on GDP are generally below one, but the response of private investment is significantly stronger — particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe. Multipliers tend to be larger in periods of high public debt, suggesting that green fiscal expansions may be more effective during downturns. Another key finding is that in response to green spending shocks, both long-term interest rates and public debt tend to decline—especially in high-debt regimes—indicating improved market expectations about fiscal sustainability. In contrast, when we estimate the effects of a shock to total public spending net of green spending, we find that both interest rates and debt increase. This suggests that economic agents perceive green spending more favorably than undifferentiated fiscal expansions, likely due to its role in mitigating climate risks, lowering long-term energy costs, and signaling credible long-term policy commitments."}}

Using this framework as an analytical foundation, the essay examines whether raising the MW can deter crime by increasing the opportunity cost of offending, particularly for low-skilled or marginalised workers. It draws on empirical research from both the UK and the US, finding that while MW rises can reduce crime, this effect is conditional on continued access to lawful employment. UK-based studies provide supportive evidence of crime reduction following MW reform, with little to no disemployment. However, US-based studies show that where MW hikes reduce employment - especially among young or low-skilled groups - crime may increase. The paper integrates refinements of Becker’s model, including Ehrlich’s time-efficiency framework and Braun’s U-shaped wage-crime hypothesis, to highlight the importance of stable, timely access to legal work.

We propose a new paradigm-flourishing by design-that reorients corporate responsibility around the active promotion of human flourishing through AI-enabled services and platforms. Drawing on empirical insights from the Global Flourishing Study, we argue for a shift from risk-minimization toward outcome-oriented, value-driven product design. The framework advances a set of principles and design criteria that integrate AI ethics (e.g., fairness, autonomy, transparency) with multi-dimensional flourishing indicators (e.g., health, meaning, social connection) into the specification and evaluation of digital products. This approach offers scholars, policymakers, and industry leaders a more comprehensive lens for assessing the ethical performance of all firms and complements existing ESG efforts by anchoring responsibility in the lived experiences and well-being of end users."}}

This paper explores how multiple legal regimes-ranging from national to international-interact and function collectively to protect human rights in a multi-layered fashion. Specifically, it examines the role of regional courts, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), in shaping national legal systems. Through a comparative lens, this article analyzes how Latin America and Europe have adopted varying approaches to human rights protection within this multi-level framework. It explores key legal concepts, including inter-legality, conventionality control, and subsidiarity, which underpin the multi-level protection paradigm. The paper also delves into case studies that illustrate how these concepts are applied in practice, such as Gelman v. Uruguay and Kimel v. Argentina (IACtHR), and Dudgeon v. United Kingdom and Von Hannover v. Germany (ECtHR). Finally, it reflects on the evolving role of states, which are increasingly engaging with international norms to enhance their regulatory capacity while maintaining sovereignty in the protection of human rights. The article ultimately advocates for a more integrated and cooperative approach to human rights governance, which combines national, regional, and global legal frameworks."}}

This is also due to the difficulty of identifying exogenous variation in the application of CSL. We exploit an almost unique feature of a CSL in 1877 Italy which was gradually implemented across municipalities based on the teacher to population ratio. This criterion generates a sharp discontinuity which can be exploited to estimate the causal effect of the early implementation of CSL on economic outcomes. Estimates based on a regression discontinuity design show that CSL had a positive long-term effect on innovation and industrial employment. Consistent with the main objective of the reform, CSL had a positive effect on human capital by increasing enrollment rates in technical schools and, more in general, the literacy rate. The results are robust to a series of placebo, falsification and manipulation tests. This study provides important policy implications in favor of the early implementation of CSL to increase the average level of education which, in turns, brings about positive effects on innovation and industrialization."}}

This paper critically checks the legal and constitutional responses to domestic violence in select South Asian jurisdictions, focusing on how statutory protections intersect with broader rights to life, dignity, and liberty. It highlights the challenges of enforcement, the role of courts in interpreting constitutional guarantees, and the influence of socio-cultural norms on the effectiveness of legal remedies. It reflects on the importance of integrating international human rights standards into domestic legal systems to better protect survivors. Ultimately, the paper argues for a more holistic, rights-based approach to addressing domestic violence one that combines legal reform with institutional accountability and socio-cultural change.

Built entirely on publicly available financial signals-including firm-level equity prices, macroeconomic indicators, and sector ETFs-the framework replaces rigid taxonomies with a flexible, behaviorally revealed peer selection mechanism governed by coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and speed-weighted Runge-Kutta integration. A stakeholder-aware thresholding scheme integrates strategic priorities without sacrificing analytical rigor. The resulting industry index is constructed using Self-Financing Hierarchical Risk Parity (SF-HRP), producing stable and interpretable portfolio weights. A Gram-Schmidt orthogonality ensures parsimony among macroeconomic factors (|ρ| &lt; 0.05), enhancing robustness. Forecasting evaluations confirm that CNN-LSTM achieves superior performance (RMSE: 0.028, R²: 0.95), reducing error by over 80% relative to baseline LSTM models, while WGANs capture tail risk distributions (R²: 0.75). Critically, the framework demonstrates that high correlation does not imply redundancy-validated through multiscale residual analysis, information-theoretic modeling, and geometric submanifold representations. At its core, this research introduces the signal-based strategic interaction model, a new theoretical paradigm that reframes financial performance as real-time strategic communication.

However, agricultural producers face dual pressure: to mitigate environmental burdens while simultaniously ensuring the financial viability of their business. Based on a case study in Latin America, a horticultural farmers’ cooperative in Costa Rica sets out to investigate the environmental and economic implications of employing  agroecological practices and identify market barriers and opportunities for sustainable business models for smallholders. The different methods used included the Agroecology Criteria Tool to evaluate the most promising producers from the cooperative, and based on their practices, further research steps were developed. The Environmental Life Cycle Costing (E-LCC) enabled the comparison of the performance of cooperative producers with the business-as-usual scenario, to later internalise environmental externalities through the monetisation of carbon and water footprints. A market analysis facilitated an understanding of the current commercial context, identifying strengths and weaknesses in a co-designed and tailored business model (BM) proposal, which utilised the Business Model Canvas (BCM). The results provide insights into the main challenges and barriers encountered by the case study farmers in improving their sustainability performances and matching business trends and requirements. The E-LCC showed potential in presenting the main focal points in a particular production model, which were further exploited in a BMC design process. Findings can be used as input for further attempts of sustainable agribusinesses through a science-based BM proposal, tailored for horticultural fermers in the Central American region, facilitating their transition towards more sustainable food systems."}}

Debt issuance mitigates present tax distortions but exacerbates them in the future, especially in wartime. However, since additional defense capital deters future wars, the expected tax distortions decline as well, making debt financing a welfare-improving strategy.

However, despite extensive research in this area, a significant gap remains: existing methods often lack explicit anatomical guidance, which leads to inconsistent capture of corresponding body-part features across different samples. This shortcoming undermines robust part-to-part matching and ultimately limits ReID performance. To address this, we propose Part Aware Transformer (PAFormer), a pose estimation based ReID model that facilitates precise part-to-part comparisons. To inject part awareness into the model, we introduce learnable parameters called ‘pose tokens’ that estimate the correlation between each body part and image regions. Furthermore, leveraging the enhanced anatomical awareness, PAFormer incorporates a learning-based visibility predictor to assess the degree of occlusion for each body part. Importantly, during inference, PAFormer operates without additional body part localization modules that are typically required by previous pose-based ReID methods. A set of extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches on well-known ReID benchmark datasets."}}

It focuses on recent atrocities in Gaza and Myanmar’s Rakhine State that have triggered serious allegations of genocide. We check what \"genocide\" means based on the rules set in 1948 and other laws (like the Rome Statute of the ICC, UN Charter, and so on). The paper identifies major jurisdictional and enforcement barriers to prosecuting genocide in modern conflict zones. We sum up the facts for each place: in Gaza, more than 59,000 people (mostly Palestinians) have died since October 2023, and about 1.9 million had to leave their homes; in Myanmar, since 2017, In Myanmar, mass killings and systematic persecution of the Rohingya by state security forces since 2017 have displaced over 1.1 million people. in \"clearance\" drives, and over 1.1 million had to flee. We analyse how these situations fit the elements of genocide, and how international courts have responded. South Africa has brought a case at the ICJ alleging genocide in Gaza, prompting provisional orders against Israel; Gambia v. Myanmar at the ICJ led to orders compelling Myanmar to prevent genocidal acts and preserve evidence.1 2The ICC has opened investigations into crimes against the Rohingya (with jurisdiction via Bangladesh’s ratification of the Rome Statute)3 and is unable to prosecute Gaza crimes (Palestine’s partial membership does not cover Israeli officials). Our analysis highlights gaps between legal obligations and political realities. We find that we need stronger tie, ups between nations, with global reach and hard actions on ICJ/ICC rules. States must reaffirm their obligations under the Genocide Convention, support independent investigations, and explore innovative mechanisms for accountability, and look into new ways to hold people to account. It's vital to step in now to block more bad acts and keep the \"never again\" vow of the Genocide Meet strong."}}

Applying the methodology on the US stock return data, we find that the IVF exhibits time-varying cyclicality. A Markov-switching model identifies two regimes where IVF dynamics are driven by macroeconomic risks or innovation, respectively. These regime-specific drivers yield distinct economic predictions, highlighting the need to consider volatility sources when assessing its macroeconomic implications."}}

Nigeria is one such country where gender inequality is deeply rooted and has a substantial impact on women's economic wellbeing, despite having the largest economy on the continent and impressive GDP growth. This study examined the relationship between gender inequality and socioeconomic development in Nigeria from 1991 to 2022. The data for the variables were obtained from the NBS, WDI, and the UNDP. The dependent variable used include the poverty rate (POVR), while the independent variables are the ratio of labour force participation for females to males (RLFP), the gross primary school enrolment rate for females to males (GPER), population growth (POPG), and the adolescent fertility rate (ADFR). The data analysis techniques used includes unit root tests, bounds cointegration, and the autoregressive distributed lag estimation method. The KPSS unit root tests shows an admixture of I(1) and I(0) series. Evidence of cointegration was established. The ARDL results showed that the ratio of labour force participation for females to males, the gross primary school enrolment rate for females to males, the adolescent fertility rate has a positive and statistically significant relationship with poverty. Further, the finding shows that population has a negative and statistically significant relationship on poverty rate. Based on these findings, the study recommends among others thing that government should focus on improving job quality rather than just participation. This includes promoting higher-wage, formal employment for women, enforcing equal pay laws, and expanding entrepreneurship support programs; Invest in improving access to and quality of primary education for girls. This can be achieved through scholarships, school feeding programs, and community outreach to encourage parents to send their daughters to school. Additionally, address cultural and social barriers that prevent girls from attending school. It is also recommending that government policies should focus on expanding reproductive health education, increasing contraceptive access, and providing economic incentives (such as scholarships and cash transfers) to delay early childbirth and support young mothers in continuing education."}}

Findings showed that teachers demonstrated very high levels of motivational needs and instructional competence, and high levels of problem-solving skills. Their overall performance was rated as very satisfactory. Analysis revealed no significant differences in motivational needs, instructional competence, and problem-solving skills when grouped according to profile variables such as age, gender, and civil status. However, teacher performance significantly differed when grouped by length of service and highest educational attainment. Moreover, there were no significant relationships found between the teachers' motivational needs, instructional competence, and problem-solving skills in relation to their performance. These findings suggest that while teachers demonstrate strong professional attributes, these alone do not significantly predict their overall performance, indicating the need to explore other contributing factors that influence teacher effectiveness."}}

Understanding this relationship is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and scholars alike as they seek to promote stable democracies and sustained economic development in middle-income countries. Kenya has long grappled with issues of corruption and challenges to its democratic processes. These problems have significant implications for governance, economic growth, political stability, religion, and social cohesion. This study investigates the effects of democracy and corruption control on Kenya's economic growth from 1990 to 2020. Utilizing the generalized method of moments (GMM) model for regression econometric analysis, the findings indicate that both democracy and control of corruption exert a positive and significant influence on economic growth in Kenya. The results of the democracy model support a positive correlation between democratic governance and economic development, while the corruption model aligns with the \"sand in the wheels\" hypothesis, suggesting that corruption may hinder economic growth in Kenya. Consequently, advancing democracy, streamlining bureaucratic processes, and implementing anti-corruption measures are crucial for achieving sustainable economic growth in Kenya. Ultimately, promoting good governance and transparency is essential for sustainable economic development, as strong democratic institutions can help mitigate corruption and enhance economic growth potential."}}

Using firm-level data from 2010 and 2019, we examine FDI intensity, FDI participation, and geographic allocation. The empirical results suggest that geopolitical risk significantly increases the scale of FDI, indicating that firms perceive it as a persistent structural threat. In contrast, while trade policy uncertainty increases the likelihood of FDI participation, it does not have a significant effect on FDI intensity. The analysis also shows that firms reallocate investment geographically in response to shocks, favoring more stable countries. Heterogeneity across industries further suggests that firms in sectors embedded in global value chains (GVCs) respond more actively to trade policy uncertainty, whereas firms in structurally vulnerable industries reduce investment under heightened geopolitical risk. These findings highlight that firms' responses to external shocks are affected not only by the nature of the shock but also by industry-specific exposure and strategic considerations."}}

Remittances can be consumed or invested by the recipient. As an investment, funds can be used for farming or to finance other nonfarm productions. In this article, we use a large and nationally representative survey to estimate the effect that remittances have on the probability of producing income from nonfarm activities (diversification) by using a bivariate probit model. Our evidence shows that remittances increase the probability that a rural family engages in nonfarm activities, at least in some regions of Bolivia. We also find evidence that the sender’s decision to remit and the recipient’s decision to diversify may be jointly determined. As such, this suggests that remittances may serve as a mechanism to overcome localized failures in Bolivia’s capital markets."}}
